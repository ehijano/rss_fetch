      <title>Integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in pentalayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically analyze the recently reported observation of integer (IQAHE) and fractional (FQAHE) quantum anomalous Hall effects at zero applied magnetic field in pentalayer graphene. Our quantitative activation and variable range hopping transport analysis of the experimental data reveals that the observed IQAHE and FQAHE at different fillings all have similar excitation gaps of the order of $5-10$ K. In addition, we also find that the observed FQAHE manifests a large hidden background contact series resistance &gt;10 k$\Omega$ of unknown origin whereas this contact resistance is much smaller ~500 $\Omega$ in the observed IQAHE. Both of these findings are surprising as well as inconsistent with the well-established phenomenology of the corresponding high-field integer and fractional quantum Hall effects in 2D semiconductor systems.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunable giant electrical anisotropy in a grating gated AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with in-plane electrical anisotropy have great potential for designing artificial synaptic devices. However, natural materials with strong intrinsic in-plane electrical anisotropy are rare. We introduce a simple strategy to produce extremely large electrical anisotropy via grating gating of a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of AlGaN/GaN. We show that periodically modulated electric potential in the 2DEG induces in-plane electrical anisotropy, which is significantly enhanced in a magnetic field, leading to an ultra large electrical anisotropy. This is induced by a giant positive magnetoresistance and a giant negative magnetoresistance under two orthogonally oriented in-plane current flows, respectively. This giant electrical anisotropy is in-situ tunable by tailoring both the grating gate voltage and the magnetic field. Our semiconductor device with controllable giant electrical anisotropy will stimulate new device applications, such as multi-terminal memtransistors and bionic synapses.</description>

      <title>Observation of Kosterlitz-Thouless Metal-to-Insulator Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. The quantized Hall conductance observed in this sandwich heterostructure originates from the combined contribution of the top and bottom surface states. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle undoped TI layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples and its critical behavior is modulated by the IEC between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), we find that thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance, whereas thicker QAH samples behave as a three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher temperatures. The IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition in the QAH PPT regime can be understood through a two-channel Chalker-Coddington network model by tuning inter-channel tunneling. The agreement between experiment and theory strongly supports the QAH PPT within the Kosterlitz-Thouless framework, where the critical metal and disordered insulator phases exist in bound and unbound states of vortex-antivortex pairs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions collimation in heterostructures based on tilted Dirac cone materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to theoretically analyze the behavior of Dirac fermions in tilted Dirac cone material, particularly those that have diffused a barrier potential.Our results show that the degree of tilt in the y-direction can lead to different collimations of the Dirac fermion beams relative to the Fermi and confinement surfaces. To study the transmission probability, we exploited our results numerically, taking into account the various configurations of the system and the different external and internal physical parameters by characterizing the behavior of fermionic transport in a proposed heterostructure. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing controllable electronic devices utilizing Dirac fermion collimation, governed by the tilt parameter, enabling precise manipulation and enhanced functionality.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Corner States in Topologically Nontrivial Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) under strong nonlinearity, focusing on the existence and stability of high-amplitude corner states, which can find applications in optics, acoustics, elastodynamics, and other wave-based systems. Our study centers on a breathing Kagome lattice composed of point masses and springs known to exhibit edge and corner states in its linear regime. By introducing onsite cubic nonlinearity, we analyze its impact on both edge and corner states. The nonlinear continuation of the corner state unveils stable high-amplitude corner states within the lattice, featuring non-zero displacements at even sites from the corner -- a characteristic absent in the linear limit. Interestingly, the nonlinear continuation of the edge state reveals its transformation into distinct families of high-amplitude corner states via two pitchfork bifurcations. While some states maintain stability, others become unstable through real instability and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. These unstable corner states dissipate their energy into the edges and the bulk over an extended period, as corroborated by long-time dynamical simulations. Consequently, our study provides insights into achieving significant energy localization at the corners of HOTIs through various classes of nonlinear states.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Magnon Transport by Superconductor Meissner Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments observe the spin-wave-Meissner-current modes in ferromagnetic insulator-superconductor heterostructures, in which the coherently excited spin waves seemingly do not decay as usual beneath the superconductor strip [Borst et al., Science 382, 430 (2023)]. We interpret this phenomenon by demonstrating that the stray magnetic field emitted by the magnetization dynamics is reflected, focused, and enhanced inside the ferromagnet by the supercurrent induced in the superconductor, such that the group velocity of spin waves is strongly enhanced. Analytical and numerical calculations based on this model predict that the coherent transport of magnons is enhanced by close to 500% for yttrium iron garnet capped by superconducting NbN with a decay length exceeding millimeters. Our finding may augment the performance of magnons in quantum information and quantum transport processing.</description>

      <title>QDsim: An user-friendly toolbox for simulating large-scale quantum dot device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce QDsim, a python package tailored for the rapid generation of charge stability diagrams in large-scale quantum dot devices, extending beyond traditional double or triple dots. QDsim is founded on the constant interaction model from which we rephrase the task of finding the lowest energy charge configuration as a convex optimization problem. Therefore, we can leverage the existing package CVXPY, in combination with an appropriate powerful solver, for the convex optimization which streamlines the creation of stability diagrams and polytopes. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate how QDsim enables the generation of large-scale dataset that can serve a basis for the training of machine-learning models for automated tuning algorithms. While the package currently does not support quantum effects beyond the constant interaction model, QDsim is a tool that directly addresses the critical need for cost-effective and expeditious data acquisition for better tuning algorithms in order to accelerate the development of semiconductor quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Floquet topological transitions in 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: interplay between time reversal symmetry breaking and dimerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the context of Floquet topological insulators (FTIs). FTIs are systems which undergo topological phase transitions, governed by Chern numbers, as a result of time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking by a time periodic process. In our proposed model, the condition of TRS breaking is achieved by circularly polarized light irradiation. We analytically show that TRS breaking is forbidden in the absence of second order neighbors hopping. In the absence of light irradiation, we identify a symmetry-protected degeneracy and prove the appearance of a flat band along a specific direction in the momentum space. Furthermore, we employ a novel method to show that the four unit cell atoms, in the absence of irradiation, can be interpreted as conserved spin states. With the breaking of TRS via light irradiation, these spin states are no longer conserved, leading to the emergence of chiral edge states. We also show how the interplay between the TRS breaking and dimerization leads to a complex phase diagram. The validity of our findings is substantiated through Chern numbers, spectral properties, localization of chiral edge states and simulations of quantum Hall transport. Our model is suitable not only for condensed matter (materials), but also for cold gases trapped in optical lattices or electric circuits.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable subband degeneracy in semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degeneracy and symmetry have a profound relation in quantum systems. Here, we report gate-tunable subband degeneracy in PbTe nanowires with a nearly symmetric cross-sectional shape. The degeneracy is revealed in electron transport by the absence of a quantized plateau. Utilizing a dual gate design, we can apply an electric field to lift the degeneracy, reflected as emergence of the plateau. This degeneracy and its tunable lifting were challenging to observe in previous nanowire experiments, possibly due to disorder. Numerical simulations can qualitatively capture our observation, shedding light on device parameters for future applications.</description>

      <title>Continuously tunable uniaxial strain control of van der Waals heterostructure devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniaxial strain has been widely used as a powerful tool for investigating and controlling the properties of quantum materials. However, existing strain techniques have so far mostly been limited to use with bulk crystals. Although recent progress has been made in extending the application of strain to two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, these techniques have been limited to optical characterization and extremely simple electrical device geometries. Here, we report a piezoelectric-based in-situ uniaxial strain technique enabling simultaneous electrical transport and optical spectroscopy characterization of dual-gated vdW heterostructure devices. Critically, our technique remains compatible with vdW heterostructure devices of arbitrary complexity fabricated on conventional silicon/silicon dioxide wafer substrates. We demonstrate a large and continuously tunable strain of up to $0.15$\% at millikelvin temperatures, with larger strain values also likely achievable. We quantify the strain transmission from the silicon wafer to the vdW heterostructure, and further demonstrate the ability of strain to modify the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene. Our technique provides a highly versatile new method for exploring the effect of uniaxial strain on both the electrical and optical properties of vdW heterostructures, and can be easily extended to include additional characterization techniques.</description>

      <title>Valley-controlled photoswitching of metal-insulator nanotextures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial heterogeneity and phase competition are hallmarks of strongly-correlated materials, promising tunable functionality on the nanoscale. Light-induced switching of a correlated insulator to a metallic state is well established. However, optical excitation generally lacks the specificity to select sub-wavelength domains and control final textures. Here, we employ valley-selective photodoping to drive the domain-specific quench of a textured Peierls insulator. Polarized excitation leverages the anisotropy of quasi-one-dimensional states at the correlated gap to initiate an insulator-to-metal transition with minimal electronic heating. We find that averting dissipation facilitates domain-specific carrier confinement, control over nanotextured phases, and a prolonged lifetime of the metastable metallic state. Complementing existing manipulation schemes, valley-selective photoexcitation will enable the activation of electronic phase separation beyond thermodynamic limitations, facilitating optically-controlled hidden states, engineered heterostructures, and polarization-sensitive percolation networks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Monoatomic Vacancies in 2D Materials on the Performance of Magnetic Tunnel Junction Devices: Insights from Configurations and Interface Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of monoatomic vacancies in 2D materials on the performance of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices using first-principles calculations within Density Functional Theory (DFT). Specifically, we analyze the influence on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with various layer configurations, uncovering distinct transmission probability patterns. Transmission calculations were conducted using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formula employing the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method. In the Ni/hBN(V$_B$)-hBN/Ni system, a significant reduction in transmission probability was observed compared to non-vacancy configurations. However, when two hBN vacancies were considered, creating the Ni/hBN(V$_B$)-hBN(V$_B$)/Ni MTJ system, a new transmission channel mediated by vacancy localized states emerged. The introduction of a monoatomic boron vacancy in the middle hBN layer of the Ni/3hBN/Ni system revealed nuanced effects on the transmission probability, highlighting alterations in the spin minority and majority channels. Additionally, we explore the monoatomic vacancy in the graphene layer in the Ni/hBN-Gr-hBN/Ni MTJ, uncovering a unique transmission channel influenced by the proximity effect. Our findings suggest that the creation of monoatomic vacancies on the insulator barrier of 2D materials induces distinctive characteristics shaped by the interaction between the surface state of the electrode and the localized state of the monoatomic vacancy layer in the MTJ system.</description>

      <title>Polyvalent Machine-Learned Potential for Cobalt: from Bulk to Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development of a quadratic Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (q-SNAP) for ferromagnetic cobalt and its applications to bulk phases, surfaces, and nanoparticles. Trained on Density Functional Theory calculations using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (DFT-PBE) functional, this machine-learned potential enables simulations of large systems over extended time scales across a wide range of temperatures and pressures at near DFT accuracy. It is validated by closely reproducing the phonon dispersions of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Co, surface energies, and the relative stability of nanoparticles of various shapes. Thermal expansion and the melting point of Co computed with this potential are close to experimental values. Furthermore, this machine-learned potential goes beyond the capabilities of simpler N-body potentials by capturing nuanced properties such as vacancy formation energies on nanoparticle vertices. This accuracy and versatility make the potential suitable for a wide range of applications, including catalysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological environments at micrometer scales and below are often crowded, and experience incessant stochastic thermal fluctuations. The presence of membranes/pores, and multiple biological entities in a constricted space can make the damping/diffusion inhomogeneous. This effect of inhomogeneity is presented by the diffusion becoming coordinate-dependent. In this paper, we analyze the consequence of inhomogeneity-induced coordinate-dependent diffusion on Brownian systems in thermal equilibrium under the It\^o's interpretation. We argue that the presence of coordinate-dependent diffusion under It\^o's formulation gives rise to an effective diffusion potential that can have substantial contribution to system's transport. Alternatively, we relate this to the existence of an emergent force of entropic origin that dictates the transport near interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Temperature constraints are highly desirable in the experimental setup when seeking the synthesis of new carbon structures. Fluctuations of the Dirac field result in temperature-dependent corrections to the Helfrich-Canham formulation, which governs the classical elasticity of the membrane in equilibrium state. Here, we examine the emergent shapes allowed by the effective model up to quadratic order in Ricci curvature and discuss the constraints required to observe them. We determine the mechanical stability conditions and provide a phase diagram characterized by the appearance of a critical temperature $T_c$ that distinguishes between carbon nanotube and fullerene phases. The observation of minimal and developable surfaces is anticipated, respectively, at the high- and low-temperature regimes.</description>

Abstract: Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) devices offer improved power efficiency, nonvolatility, and performance compared to static RAM, making them ideal, for instance, for cache memory applications. Efficient magnetization switching, long data retention, and high-density integration in SOT MRAM require ferromagnets (FM) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) combined with large torques enhanced by Orbital Hall Effect (OHE). We have engineered PMA [Co/Ni]$_3$ FM on selected OHE layers (Ru, Nb, Cr) and investigated the potential of theoretically predicted larger orbital Hall conductivity (OHC) to quantify the torque and switching current in OHE/[Co/Ni]$_3$ stacks. Our results demonstrate a $\sim$30\% enhancement in damping-like torque efficiency with a positive sign for the Ru OHE layer compared to a pure Pt, accompanied by a $\sim$20\% reduction in switching current for Ru compared to pure Pt across more than 250 devices, leading to more than a 60\% reduction in switching power. These findings validate the application of Ru in devices relevant to industrial contexts, supporting theoretical predictions regarding its superior OHC. This investigation highlights the potential of enhanced orbital torques to improve the performance of orbital-assisted SOT-MRAM, paving the way for next-generation memory technology.</description>

      <title>Coupled metamaterial-phonon terahertz range polaritons in a topological insulator</title>

Abstract: We report terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (TDTS) experiments demonstrating strong light-matter coupling in a terahertz (THz) LC-metamaterial in which the phonon resonance of a topological insulator (TI) thin film is coupled to the photonic modes of an array of electronic split-ring resonators. As we tune the metamaterial resonance frequency through the frequency of the low frequency $\alpha$ mode of (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST), we observe strong mixing and level repulsion between phonon and metamaterial resonance. This hybrid resonance is a phonon polariton. We observe a normalized coupling strength, $\eta$ = $\Omega_R$/$\omega_c$ $\approx$ 0.09, using the measured vacuum Rabi frequency and cavity resonance. Our results demonstrate that one can tune the mechanical properties of materials by changing their electromagnetic environment and therefore modify their magnetic and topological degrees of freedom via coupling to the lattice in this fashion.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Single-Shot Parity Measurement in an InAs-Al Hybrid Device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fusion of non-Abelian anyons or topological defects is a fundamental operation in measurement-only topological quantum computation. In topological superconductors, this operation amounts to a determination of the shared fermion parity of Majorana zero modes. As a step towards this, we implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity in indium arsenide-aluminum heterostructures with a gate-defined nanowire. The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of these quantum dots' quantum capacitance of up to 1 fF. Our quantum capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1 in 3.7 $\mu$s at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T. These results are consistent with a measurement of the fermion parity encoded in a pair of Majorana zero modes that are separated by approximately 3 $\mu$m and subjected to a low rate of poisoning by non-equilibrium quasiparticles. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement error probability of 1%.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</description>

Abstract: The topological phase transition in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model is studied using a real-space approach. An effective Hamiltonian for the topologically protected edge-modes in a finite-size system is developed. The topological phase transition is understood in terms of a global perturbation to the system which lifts the degeneracy of the edge-modes. The effective-Hamiltonian method is also applied to a system with spatially varying hopping strengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.09751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutralization probability of low energy Na$^{+}$ ions scattered from In- and As-rich InAs(001) surfaces is measured by time-of-flight spectroscopy. It is found that the neutralization probability for projectiles scattered from As sites is larger than from In sites for both types of surfaces. A modification of the resonant charge transfer model is proposed in which a freezing contour that follows the atomic structure is combined with molecular dynamics and density functional theory. Together, these approaches show that the neutralization of alkali projectiles scattered from a compound solid material is determined by multiple factors, particularly the surface atomic and electronic structures. This model is applicable to any system in which the surface potential is inhomogeneous, such as compound materials and adsorbate-covered surfaces.</description>

      <title>Particle dynamics and ergodicity-breaking in twisted-bilayer optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized a twisted bilayer-like optical potential for ultra-cold atoms, which in contrast to solid-state set ups may allow for an arbitrary ratio between the inter- and intra-layer couplings. For commensurate Moir\'e twistings a large-enough inter-layer coupling results in particle transport dominated by channel formation. For incommensurate twistings, the interlayer coupling acts as an effective disorder strength. Whereas for weak couplings the whole spectrum remains ergodic, at a critical value part of the eigenspectrum transitions into multifractal states. A similar transition may be observed as well as a function of an energy bias between the two layers. Our study reveals atoms in optical twisted-bilayer lattices as an interesting new platform for the study of ergodicity breaking and multifractality.</description>

      <title>Intertwined van-Hove Singularities as a Mechanism for Loop Current Order in Kagome Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs,Rb,K) indicated spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in the charge density wave state in the absence of static magnetization. The loop current order (LCO) is proposed as its cause, but a microscopic model explaining the emergence of LCO through electronic correlations has not been firmly established. We show that the coupling between van-Hove singularities (vHS) with distinct mirror symmetries is a key ingredient to generate LCO ground state. By constructing an effective model, we find that when multiple vHS with opposite mirror eigenvalues are close in energy, the nearest-neighbor electron repulsion favors a ground state with coexisting LCO and charge bond order. It is then demonstrated that this mechanism applies to the Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings provide an intriguing mechanism of LCO and pave the way for a deeper understanding of complex quantum phenomena in Kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical characterization of $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases via quantum quenches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complete characterization of a generic $d$-dimensional Floquet topological phase is usually hard for the requirement of information about the micromotion throughout the entire driving period. In a recent work [L. Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 183001 (2020)], an experimentally feasible dynamical detection scheme was proposed to characterize the integer Floquet topological phases using quantum quenches. However, this theory is still far away from completion, especially for free-fermion Floquet topological phases, where the states can also be characterized by $Z_{2}$ invariants. Here we develop the first full and unified dynamical characterization theory for the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases of different dimensionality and tenfold-way symmetry classes by quenching the system from a trivial and static initial state to the Floquet topological regime through suddenly changing the parameters and turning on the periodic driving. By measuring the minimal information of Floquet bands via the stroboscopic time-averaged spin polarizations, we show that the topological spin texture patterns emerging on certain discrete momenta of Brillouin zone called the $0$ or $\pi$ gap highest-order band-inversion surfaces provide a measurable dynamical $Z_{2}$ Floquet invariant, which uniquely determines the Floquet boundary modes in the corresponding quasienergy gap and characterizes the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topology. The applications of our theory are illustrated via one- and two-dimensional models that are accessible in current quantum simulation experiments. Our work provides a highly feasible way to detect the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topology and completes the dynamical characterization for the full tenfold classes of Floquet topological phases, which shall advance the research in theory and experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Swift-Hohenberg (SH) and Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) models are minimal yet powerful approaches for studying phenomena such as pattern formation, collective order, and defects via smooth order parameters. They are based on a free-energy functional that inherently includes elasticity effects. This study addresses how gradient elasticity (GE), a theory that accounts for elasticity effects at microscopic scales by introducing additional characteristic lengths, is incorporated into SH and PFC models. After presenting the fundamentals of these theories and models, we first calculate the characteristic lengths for various lattice symmetries in an approximated setting. We then discuss numerical simulations of stress fields at dislocations and comparisons with analytic solutions within first and second strain-gradient elasticity. Effective GE characteristic lengths for the elastic fields induced by dislocations are found to depend on the free-energy parameters in the same manner as the phase correlation length, thus unveiling how they change with the quenching depth. The findings presented in this study enable a thorough discussion and analysis of small-scale elasticity effects in pattern formation and crystalline systems using SH and PFC models and, importantly, complete the elasticity analysis therein. Additionally, we provide a microscopic foundation for GE in the context of order-disorder phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence (RF) of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak excitation. These properties are commonly explained disjoinedly as the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light, until a recent theory attributes anti-bunching to the laser-like spectrum's interference with the incoherently scattered light. However, the theory implies higher-order scattering processes, and led to an experiment purporting to validate an atom's simultaneous scattering of two photons. If true, it could complicate RF's prospects in quantum information applications. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all RF photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the RF's spectral and correlation properties. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, with the strongest effects measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole RF and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides novel understandings of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Kondo screening in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the Kondo effect of a spin-1/2 impurity coupled to a two-dimensional altermagnet host material. To attain the low-temperature many-body Kondo physics of the system, we have performed a numerical renormalization group calculations that allows us to access the spectral properties of the system at zero temperature. The impurity spectral function and the Kondo temperature were calculated for different set of parameters, including Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and an external magnetic field. Interestingly, in the RSOC and altermagnetic fields, the hybridization function is spin independent, despite the characteristic broken time-reversal symmetry of the altermagnet. This is because the alternating sign of the spin splitting of the bands in the momentum space renders equal contributions for both spin components of the hybridization function. Our results demonstrate that, although the hybridization function is time-reversal symmetric, the Kondo temperature is substantially suppressed by the altermagnet coupling. Moreover, we have investigated the effect of an external magnetic field applied in the altermagnet along different directions. Interestingly, we observe an important restraining of the Kondo peak which depends strongly on the direction of the field. This anisotropic effect is, however, masked if strong Zeeman splitting takes place at the impurity, as it shatters the Kondo-singlet state.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multi-party entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that precludes entanglement-free regions, and thus protects quantum correlations. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Toward Optimum Coupling between Free Electrons and Confined Optical Modes</title>

Abstract: Free electrons are unique tools to probe and manipulate nanoscale optical fields with emerging applications in ultrafast spectromicroscopy and quantum metrology. However, advances in this field are hindered by the small probability associated with the excitation of single optical modes by individual free electrons. Here, we theoretically investigate the scaling properties of the electron-driven excitation probability for a wide variety of optical modes including plasmons in metallic nanostructures and Mie resonances in dielectric cavities, spanning a broad spectral range that extends from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The highest probabilities for the direct generation of three-dimensionally confined modes are observed at low electron and mode energies in small structures, with order-unity ($\sim100$\%) coupling demanding the use of $&lt;100$~eV electrons interacting with $&lt;1$~eV polaritons confined down to tens of nm. Electronic transitions in artificial atoms also emerge as practical systems to realize strong coupling to few-eV free electrons. In contrast, conventional dielectric cavities reach a maximum probability in the few-percent range. In addition, we show that waveguide modes can be generated with higher-than-unity efficiency by phase-matched interaction with grazing electrons, suggesting an efficient method to create multiple excitations of a localized optical mode by an individual electron through funneling the so-generated propagating photons into a confining cavity -- an alternative approach to direct electron-cavity interaction.

Abstract: The emerging field of free-electron quantum optics enables electron-photon entanglement and holds the potential for generating nontrivial photon states for quantum information processing. Although recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient of dielectric laser accelerators.</description>
