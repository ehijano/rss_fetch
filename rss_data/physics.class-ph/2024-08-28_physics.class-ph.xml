      <title>Predicting multi-parametric dynamics of externally forced oscillators using reservoir computing and minimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical systems are known to exhibit complex dynamical behavior from harmonic oscillations to chaotic motion. The dynamics undergo qualitative changes due to changes to internal system parameters like stiffness, and also due to changes to external forcing. Mapping out complete bifurcation diagrams numerically or experimentally is resource-consuming, or even infeasible. This study uses a data-driven approach to investigate how bifurcations can be learned from a few system response measurements. Particularly, the concept of reservoir computing (RC) is employed. As proof of concept, a minimal training dataset under the resource constraint problem of a Duffing oscillator with harmonic external forcing is provided as training data. Our results indicate that the RC not only learns to represent the system dynamics for the trained external forcing, but it also manages to provide qualitatively accurate and robust system response predictions for completely unknown \textit{multi-}parameter regimes outside the training data. Particularly, while being trained solely on regular period-2 cycle dynamics, the proposed framework can correctly predict higher-order periodic and even chaotic dynamics for out-of-distribution forcing signals.</description>

      <title>Relative Equilibria for Scaling Symmetries and Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore scaling symmetries within the framework of symplectic geometry. We focus on the action $\Phi$ of the multiplicative group $G = \mathbb{R}^+$ on exact symplectic manifolds $(M, \omega,\theta)$, with $\omega = -d\theta$, where $ \theta $ is a given primitive one-form. Extending established results in symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian dynamics, we introduce conformally symplectic maps, conformally Hamiltonian systems, conformally symplectic group actions, and the notion of conformal invariance. This framework allows us to generalize the momentum map to the conformal momentum map, which is crucial for understanding scaling symmetries. Additionally, we provide a generalized Hamiltonian Noether's theorem for these symmetries.
  We introduce the (conformal) augmented Hamiltonian $H_{\xi}$ and prove that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to equations involving $ H _{ \xi } $ and the primitive one-form $\theta$. We derive their main properties, emphasizing the differences from relative equilibria in traditional symplectic actions.
  For cotangent bundles, we define a scaled cotangent lifted action and derive explicit formulas for the conformal momentum map. We also provide a general definition of central configurations for Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles that admit scaling symmetries. Applying these results to simple mechanical systems, we introduce the augmented potential $U_{\xi}$ and show that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to an equation involving $ U _{ \xi } $ and the Lagrangian one-form $\theta_L$.
  Finally, we apply our general theory to the Newtonian $n$-body problem, recovering the classical equations for central configurations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear fourth order Taylor expansion of lattice Boltzmann schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.12417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal expansion of multiple relaxation times lattice Boltzmann schemes in terms of a single infinitesimal numerical variable. The result is a system of partial differential equations for the conserved moments of the lattice Boltzmann scheme. The expansion is presented  in the nonlinear case up to fourth order accuracy. The asymptotic corrections of  the nonconserved moments  are developed in terms of  equilibrium values and  partial differentials of the conserved moments. Both expansions are coupled and conduct to explicit compact formulas. The new algebraic expressions are validated with previous results obtained with this approach. The example of isothermal D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann scheme illustrates the theoretical framework.</description>
