      <title>Potential of quantum scientific machine learning applied to weather modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore how quantum scientific machine learning can be used to tackle the challenge of weather modelling. Using parameterised quantum circuits as machine learning models, we consider two paradigms: supervised learning from weather data and physics-informed solving of the underlying equations of atmospheric dynamics. In the first case, we demonstrate how a quantum model can be trained to accurately reproduce real-world global stream function dynamics at a resolution of 4{\deg}. We detail a number of problem-specific classical and quantum architecture choices used to achieve this result. Subsequently, we introduce the barotropic vorticity equation (BVE) as our model of the atmosphere, which is a $3^{\text{rd}}$ order partial differential equation (PDE) in its stream function formulation. Using the differentiable quantum circuits algorithm, we successfully solve the BVE under appropriate boundary conditions and use the trained model to predict unseen future dynamics to high accuracy given an artificial initial weather state. Whilst challenges remain, our results mark an advancement in terms of the complexity of PDEs solved with quantum scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Grover's algorithm in a four-qubit silicon processor above the fault-tolerant threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with &gt;99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stochastic Chemical Kinetics on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chemical Master Equation (CME) provides a highly accurate, yet extremely resource-intensive representation of a stochastic chemical reaction network and its kinetics due to the exponential scaling of its possible states with the number of reacting species. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum algorithms and hardware can be employed to model stochastic chemical kinetics as described by the CME using the Schl\"ogl Model of a trimolecular reaction network as an illustrative example. To ground our study of the performance of our quantum algorithms, we first determine a range of suitable parameters for constructing the stochastic Schl\"ogl operator in the mono- and bistable regimes of the model using a classical computer and then discuss the appropriateness of our parameter choices for modeling approximate kinetics on a quantum computer. We then apply the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to evaluate the smallest-magnitude eigenvalues, $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$, which describe the transition rates of both the mono- and bi-stable systems, and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm combined with the Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition (VQSVD) algorithm to estimate the zeromode (ground state) of the bistable case. Our quantum computed results from both noisy and noiseless quantum simulations agree within a few percent with the classically computed eigenvalues and zeromode. Altogether, our work outlines a practical path toward the quantum solution of exponentially complex stochastic chemical kinetics problems and other related stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Fractional Revivals in Elliptical Atomtronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional revivals are recently reported for circular atomtronics, but get disturbed for a nonzero eccentricity of the waveguide geometry. Here, we provide a mechanism for the elliptical atomtronics with arbitrary eccentricity to restore fractional revivals. The uniform ground state of the circular waveguide becomes nonuniform in the elliptical geometry. An appropriate dispersion management can bring back the uniformity and we use the overlap function numerically to identify the corresponding dispersion coefficients, which match our proposed analytical formula. The fact that the cloud spends mostly along the semimajor edges, is demonstrated by the survival function. The said dispersion management recovers the desired fractional revivals patterns, where the revival time-scale becomes independent of the eccentricity. The present method paves the way also to observe other known phenomena of circular atomtronics in elliptical atomtronics.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis of a filtering variational quantum algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even a minor boost in solving combinatorial optimization problems can greatly benefit multiple industries. Quantum computers, with their unique information processing capabilities, hold promise for delivering such enhancements. The Filtering Variational Quantum Eigensolver (F-VQE) is a variational hybrid quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems on existing quantum computers with limited qubit number, connectivity, and fidelity. In this work we employ Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial circuits as our parameterized quantum circuits. We propose a hardware-efficient implementation that respects limited qubit connectivity and show that they halve the number of circuits necessary to evaluate the gradient with the parameter-shift rule. To assess the potential of this protocol in the context of combinatorial optimization, we conduct extensive numerical analysis. We compare the performance against three classical baseline algorithms on weighted MaxCut and the Asymmetric Traveling Salesperson Problem (ATSP). We employ noiseless simulators for problems encoded on 13 to 29 qubits, and up to 37 qubits on the IBMQ real quantum devices. The ATSP encoding employed reduces the number of qubits and avoids the need of constraints compared to the standard QUBO / Ising model. Despite some observed positive signs, we conclude that significant development is necessary for a practical advantage with F-VQE.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Gaussian State Analysis with one Bounded Photon Counter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian states are ubiquitous in quantum optics and information processing, and it is essential to have effective tools for their characterization. One such tool is a photon-number-resolving detector, and the simplest configuration involves counting the total number of photons in the state to be characterized. This motivates the following question: What properties of a multi-mode Gaussian state are determined by the signal from one detector that measures total number photons up to some bound? We find that if the Gaussian state occupies $S$ modes and the probabilities of $n$ photons for all $n\leq 8S$ are known, then we can determine the spectrum of the Gaussian covariance matrix and the magnitude of the displacements in each eigenspace of the covariance matrix. Nothing more can be learned, even if all photon-number probabilities are known. When the state is pure, the covariance matrix spectrum determines the squeezing parameters of the state.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on bipartite entanglement in noisy graph states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are a key resource for a number of applications in quantum information theory. Due to the inherent noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices, it is important to understand the effects noise has on the usefulness of graph states. We consider a noise model where the initial qubits undergo depolarizing noise before the application of the CZ operations that generate edges between qubits situated at the nodes of the resulting graph state. For this model we develop a method for calculating the coherent information -- a lower bound on the rate at which entanglement can be distilled, across a bipartition of the graph state. We also identify some patterns on how adding more nodes or edges affects the bipartite distillable entanglement. As an application, we find a family of graph states that maintain a strictly positive coherent information for any amount of (non-maximal) depolarizing noise.</description>

      <title>Adaptive User-Centric Entanglement Routing in Quantum Data Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) holds immense promise in harnessing the potential of quantum computing by interconnecting multiple small quantum computers (QCs) through a quantum data network (QDN). Establishing long-distance quantum entanglement between two QCs for quantum teleportation within the QDN is a critical aspect, and it involves entanglement routing - finding a route between QCs and efficiently allocating qubits along that route. Existing approaches have mainly focused on optimizing entanglement performance for current entanglement connection (EC) requests. However, they often overlook the user's perspective, wherein the user making EC requests operates under a budget constraint over an extended period. Furthermore, both QDN resources (quantum channels and qubits) and the EC requests, reflecting the DQC workload, vary over time. In this paper, we present a novel user-centric entanglement routing problem that spans an extended period to maximize the entanglement success rate while adhering to the user's budget constraint. To address this challenge, we leverage the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework to decompose the long-term optimization problem into per-slot problems, allowing us to find solutions using only the current system information. Subsequently, we develop efficient algorithms based on continuous-relaxation and Gibbs-sampling techniques to solve the per-slot entanglement routing problem. Theoretical performance guarantees are provided for both the per-slot and long-term problems. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of entanglement success rate and budget adherence.</description>

      <title>One-Way Quantum Repeater with Rare-Earth-Ions Doped in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are proposed to overcome exponential photon loss over distance in fibers. One-way quantum repeaters eliminate the need for two-way classical communications, which can potentially outperform quantum memory based quantum repeaters. I propose that rare-earth-ions doped in solids and coupled with nano-cavity can be used to generate photonic cluster state efficiently, which serve as good platforms for one-way quantum repeater nodes. In addition, I propose a multiplexed scheme of photonic tree cluster state generation with multiple quantum emitters. With less than 100 quantum emitters, secret key rates can reach the order of MHz over a few thousand kilometers. This proposal is especially useful for generating large scale photonic cluster state, which is essential for correcting operational errors during processing in quantum repeater nodes.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in randomized quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with quantum transport in open quantum graphs. We consider the case of complete graphs on $n$ vertices with an edge removed and attached to two leads, to represent the entrance and exit channels, from where we calculate the transmission coefficient. We include the possibility of several vertices being connected or not and associate it with a randomization parameter $p$. To implement the calculation, we had to introduce the transmission coefficient of randomized quantum graphs (RQG), and we also proposed a procedure to obtain the exact and approximate but reliable results for such transmission coefficients. The main results show that the transport is importantly affected by the removal of connections between pairs of vertices, but they also indicate the presence of a region where the transmission is fully suppressed, even when the number of edge removal is not too small.</description>

      <title>Quantum subspace expansion in the presence of hardware noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding ground state energies on current quantum processing units (QPUs) using algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) continues to pose challenges. Hardware noise severely affects both the expressivity and trainability of parametrized quantum circuits, limiting them to shallow depths in practice. Here, we demonstrate that both issues can be addressed by synergistically integrating VQE with a quantum subspace expansion, allowing for an optimal balance between quantum and classical computing capabilities and costs. We perform a systematic benchmark analysis of the iterative quantum-assisted eigensolver of [K. Bharti and T. Haug, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 104}, L050401 (2021)] in the presence of hardware noise. We determine ground state energies of 1D and 2D mixed-field Ising spin models on noisy simulators and on the IBM QPUs ibmq_quito (5 qubits) and ibmq_guadalupe (16 qubits). To maximize accuracy, we propose a suitable criterion to select the subspace basis vectors according to the trace of the noisy overlap matrix. Finally, we show how to systematically approach the exact solution by performing controlled quantum error mitigation based on probabilistic error reduction on the noisy backend fake_guadalupe.</description>

      <title>Enhancing teleportation via noisy channels: effects of the induced multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation in the presence of noisy channels acting on a bipartite resource state is considered. We consider a family of generalized noisy channels that continuously connect the amplitude damping and the dephasing channels, encompassing a wide family of in-between scenarios, to delve into the relation between the teleportation success and the amount of 3- and 4-partite entanglement (distributed among the qubits of the resource state and those representing local environments) generated during the evolution. Our analysis reveals that for a fixed entanglement of the resource state, the channels that better protect the teleportation fidelity against the detrimental effects of noise are those that generate higher amounts of (GHZ-type) multipartite entanglement. This suggests that the dynamically induced multipartite correlations may serve as an additional resource for teleportation, and throws light into the characterization of processes, and of the type of induced entanglement, according to their capability of assisting the protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic theories the principle of microscopic causality states that ``information cannot travel faster than the speed of light'' \cite{kaku}. In the present work we show that the time evolution of relativistic wave functions violates this principle. We consider here the wave functions of massless and massive particles. In the case of massless particles the wave functions which violate the microscopic causality have an analytic form while in the case of massive particles we have to rely on numerical calculations. In both cases the wave functions which are strictly localized at $t=0$, at later times do not vanish {\it outside} the future light cone. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Qandle: Accelerating State Vector Simulation Using Gate-Matrix Caching and Circuit Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the computational complexity associated with state-vector simulation for quantum circuits, we propose a combination of advanced techniques to accelerate circuit execution. Quantum gate matrix caching reduces the overhead of repeated applications of the Kronecker product when applying a gate matrix to the state vector by storing decomposed partial matrices for each gate. Circuit splitting divides the circuit into sub-circuits with fewer gates by constructing a dependency graph, enabling parallel or sequential execution on disjoint subsets of the state vector. These techniques are implemented using the PyTorch machine learning framework. We demonstrate the performance of our approach by comparing it to other PyTorch-compatible quantum state-vector simulators. Our implementation, named Qandle, is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing machine learning workflows, providing a user-friendly API and compatibility with the OpenQASM format. Qandle is an open-source project hosted on GitHub https://github.com/gstenzel/qandle and PyPI https://pypi.org/project/qandle/ .</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Markovian Qubit with Unitary Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a single Markovian qubit governed by a Lindblad master equation and subject to fast unitary control. Using reduced control systems and optimal control theory we determine (i) controls for cooling and heating such systems in a time-optimal way as well as (ii) the set of stabilizable states in the Bloch ball. No restrictions on the Lindblad equation are assumed, and several known results, for instance for the Bloch equations, are recovered. Furthermore we introduce integral systems, for which the solutions take a particularly nice form. These integral systems include all systems with real Lindblad terms as well as all coolable systems. The method allows for intuitive visualizations and is mostly analytical, making use of only basic numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the fidelity and power loss of photonic quantum gates, implemented by a segmentation of coupled optical waveguides, as functions of the number of segments. We show that designs with a large number of segments mitigate effectively the systematic errors for a wide range of error correlation strength and variance. We quantify the design roughness effect on the power loss and analyze the performance of various methods for smoothing the configuration of the waveguides. We observe an asymptotic scaling behaviour of the gate fidelity and power loss with the number of segments.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally study the heating of trapped atomic ions during measurement of their internal qubit states. During measurement, ions are projected into one of two basis states and discriminated by their state-dependent fluorescence. We observe that ions in the fluorescing state rapidly scatter photons and heat at a rate of $\dot{\bar{n}}\sim 2\times 10^4$ quanta/s, which is $\sim 30$ times faster than the anomalous ion heating rate. We introduce a quantum trajectory-based framework that accurately reproduces the experimental results and provides a unified description of ion heating for both continuous and discrete sources.</description>

      <title>Magnon-Skyrmion Hybrid Quantum Systems: Tailoring Interactions via Magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent and dissipative interactions between different quantum systems are essential for the construction of hybrid quantum systems and the investigation of novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose and analyze a magnon-skyrmion hybrid quantum system, consisting of a micromagnet and nearby magnetic skyrmions. We predict a strong coupling mechanism between the magnonic mode of the micromagnet and the quantized helicity degree of freedom of the skyrmion. We show that with this hybrid setup it is possible to induce magnon-mediated nonreciprocal interactions and responses between distant skyrmion qubits or between skyrmion qubits and other quantum systems like superconducting qubits. This work provides a quantum platform for the investigation of diverse quantum effects and quantum information processing with magnetic microstructures.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion-mechanical hybrid quantum systems: Manipulation of skyrmion qubits via phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmion qubits are a new highly promising logic element for quantum information processing. However, their scalability to multiple interacting qubits remains challenging. We propose a hybrid quantum setup with skyrmion qubits strongly coupled to nanomechanical cantilevers via magnetic coupling, which harnesses phonons as quantum interfaces for the manipulation of distant skyrmion qubits. A linear drive is utilized to achieve the modulation of the stiffness coefficient of the cantilever, resulting in an exponential enhancement of the coupling strength between the skyrmion qubit and the mechanical mode. We also consider the case of a topological resonator array, which allows us to study interactions between skyrmion qubits and topological phonon band structure, as well as chiral skyrmion-skyrmion interactions. The scheme suggested here offers a fascinating platform for investigating quantum information processing and quantum simulation with magnetic microstructures.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Kirkwood-Dirac positive states based on discrete Fourier transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution is helpful to describe nonclassical phenomena and quantum advantages, which have been linked with nonpositive entries of KD distribution. Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are the eigenprojectors of the two eigenbases of two observables and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix is the transition matrix between the two eigenbases. In a system with prime dimension, the set $\mathcal{E}_{KD+}$ of KD positive states based on the DFT matrix is convex combinations of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$. That is, $\mathcal{E}_{KD+}={\rm conv}(\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{B})$ [arXiv:2306.00086]. In this paper, we generalize the result. That is, in a $d$-dimensional system, $\mathcal{E}_{KD+}={\rm conv}(\Omega)$ for $d=p^{2}$ and $d=pq$, where $p, q$ are prime and $\Omega$ is the set of projectors of all the pure KD positive states.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of magnetic systems by quantized surface acoustic wave via piezomagnetic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantized surface acoustic wave (SAW) in the piezoelectric medium has recently been studied, and is used to control electric dipoles of quantum systems via the electric field produced through piezoelectric effect. However, it is not easy and convenient to manipulate magnetic moments directly by the electric field. We here study a quantum theory of SAW in the piezomagnetic medium. We show that the intrinsic properties of the piezomagnetic medium enable the SAW in the piezomagnetic medium to directly interact with magnetic moments of quantum systems via magnetic field induced by piezomagnetic effect. By taking the strip SAW waveguide made of piezomagnetic medium as an example, we further study the coupling strengths between different magnetic quantum systems with magnetic moments and the quantized single-mode SAW in the waveguide. Based on this, we discuss the interaction between magnetic quantum systems mediated by the quantized multi-mode SAW in piezomagnetic waveguide. Our study provides a convenient way to directly control magnetic quantum systems by quantized SAW, and offers potential applications to on-chip information processing based on solid-state quantum systems via quantized acoustic wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of boundaries on the bulk properties of quantum many-body systems is an intriguing subject of study. One can define a boundary effect function, which quantifies the change in the ground state as a function of the distance from the boundary. This function serves as an upper bound for the correlation functions and the entanglement entropies in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we perform numerical analyses of the boundary effect function for one-dimensional free-fermion models. We find that the upper bound established by the boundary effect fuction is tight for the examined systems, providing a deep insight into how correlations and entanglement are developed in the ground state as the system size grows. As a by-product, we derive a general fidelity formula for fermionic Gaussian states in a self-contained manner, rendering the formula easier to apprehend.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence plays a crucial role in manipulating and controlling quantum systems, leading to breakthroughs in various fields such as quantum information, quantum sensing, and the detection of gravitational waves. Most coherence witnesses rely on the assumption of being able to control quantum states. Here we report a device-independent coherence model by extending the standard Bell theory to multiple source scenarios. We propose a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type paradox to verify the particle and wave behaviors of a coherent carrier. We experimentally generate generalized two-photon entangled states that violate the present paradox, witnessing spatial quantum superposition through local measurements.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted quantum transduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output at a different frequency, while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity. When operating between the microwave and optical frequencies, it is crucial for quantum networking between quantum computers via low-loss optical links, and thereby enabling distributed quantum computing. However, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer from low transduction efficiency due to weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency leads to inevitable thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product in such systems is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To resolve the conundrum, we propose to boost the transduction efficiency by consuming entanglement within the same frequency band (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak nonlinear coupling, which establishes a high-fidelity quantum communication link without any signal encoding. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Information Gain, Operator Spreading, and Sensitivity to Perturbations as Quantifiers of Chaos in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a continuous weak measurement tomography protocol to explore the signatures of chaos in the quantum system(s). We generate the measurement record as a series of expectation values of an observable evolving under the desired dynamics, which can show a transition from integrability to chaos. We find that the rate of information gain depends on the degree of chaos in the dynamics, the choice of initial observable, and how well the operator is aligned along the density matrix. The amount of operator spreading in the Krylov subspace, as quantified by the fidelity in quantum tomography and various other metrics of information gain, increases with the degree of chaos in the system. We study operator spreading in many-body quantum systems by its potential to generate an informationally complete measurement record. Our quantifiers for operator spreading are more consistent indicators of quantum chaos than Krylov complexity. Our study gives an operational interpretation for operator spreading in terms of fidelity gain in quantum tomography.
  Continuing in our journey of finding the footprints of chaos in the quantum domain, we explore the growth of errors in noisy tomography. For random states, when the measurement record is obtained from a random operator, the subsequent drop in the fidelity obtained is inversely correlated to the degree of chaos in the dynamics. This gives us an operational interpretation of Loschmidt echo for operators by connecting it to the performance of quantum tomography. We find a quantity to capture the scrambling of errors, an out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) between two operators under perturbed and unperturbed dynamics that serves as a signature of chaos. Our results demonstrate a fundamental link between Loschmidt echo and scrambling of errors, as captured by OTOCs, with operational consequences in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>The Shaping of Flying Qubits based on Quantum Optimal Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of flying qubits carried by itinerant photons is ubiquitous in quantum communication networks. In addition to their logical states, the shape of flying qubits must also be tailored to match the remote receiver. In this paper, we introduce the quantum optimal control theory to the design of flying-qubit shaping protocols. A gradient-based algorithm is proposed for the generation of arbitrary-shape flying qubits with general non-ideal emitters. Simulations show that, as a joint control with the traditionally used tunable coupler, coherent driving fields can be applied to the shaping when the coupling strength is fixed or limited. The optimized control protocols can effectively suppress unwanted level leakage and multi-photon radiation. The method provides a systematic approach to high-fidelity control of flying qubits using realistic quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine some properties of the non-normalized (or canonical) density matrix in the coherent states representation, by two equivalent ways. On the one hand by its definition, and on the other hand as a solution to Bloch's canonical equation. It is concluded that, since in many cases Bloch's differential equation is difficult to solve, in applications it is preferable to use the expression obtained directly from the definition of the canonical density matrix in the coherent states representation. This conclusion is verified by examining several cases of quantum systems with linear or quadratic energy spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of quantum states can be endowed with a metric structure using the second order derivatives of the relative entropy, giving rise to the so-called Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov inner product. We explore its geometric properties on the submanifold of faithful, zero-displacement Gaussian states parameterised by their covariance matrices, deriving expressions for the geodesic equations, curvature tensors and scalar curvature. Our analysis suggests that the curvature of the manifold is strictly monotonic with respect to the von Neumann entropy, and thus can be interpreted as a measure of state uncertainty. This provides supporting evidence for the Petz conjecture in continuous variable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized canonical form of action of dynamic theories with higher derivatives is proposed, which does not require the introduction of additional dynamic variables. This form is the initial point for the construction of quantum theory, in which the state of motion of the system is described by the wave functional on its trajectories in the configuration space, and the functional itself is an eigenvector of the action operator. The Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator is considered as the simplest model. For this case, the correspondence between the new form of quantum theory and "ordinary" quantum mechanics has been established in the local limit, when the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator is reduced to the "ordinary" harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Multiple single-photon generations in three-level atoms coupled to cavity with non-Markovian effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how to generate the multiple single-photon wavepackets of arbitrary temporal shape from an optical cavity coupled with $N$ three-level atoms driven by a driving field in the non-Markovian regime. We derive an exact analytical expression of the optimal driving field for generating such wavepackets, which depends on two detunings of the cavity and driving field with respect to the three-level atoms. The cavity we used consists of two mirrors facing each other, where one is perfect and the other exists the dissipation (one-sided cavity), which couples with the corresponding non-Markovian input-output fields. If the first single-photon wavepacket generated by the Markovian system is the same as the non-Markovian case, the Markovian system cannot generate the same multiple single-photon wavepackets as the non-Markovian one when the spectral widths of the other environments taking values different from the spectral width of the first environment, while setting the equal spectral widths for the different environments can generate this. The generated multiple different single-photon wavepackets are not independent of each other, which satisfy certain relations with non-Markovian spectral parameters. We analyse the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian regimes and compare the differences between them, where the cavity interacts simultaneously with the multiple non-Markovian environments. Finally, we extend the above results to a general non-Markovian quantum network involving many cavities coupled with driven three-level atoms.</description>

      <title>Closing Optical Bloch Equations in waveguide QED: Dynamics, Energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Bloch Equations (OBE) model the dynamics of a classically driven two-level atom coupled to a thermal electromagnetic field. From a global viewpoint, they derive from the unitary evolution of a closed, isolated atom-field system. We study the emergence of the OBE in the case where the driving and the thermal fields are confined in one spatial dimension -- a situation usually found in waveguide-QED. The joint atom-field system forms a "one-dimensional atom" (1D atom) whose closed dynamics can be solved, providing access to light-matter correlations. Such closure of the OBE unveils a new term capturing the driving of the atom by itself, or self-drive, which is proportional to the atom coherences in the energy basis. A 1D atom also constitutes an autonomous, energy-conserving system. Hence, energy exchanges between the atom and the field can be conveniently analyzed as closed first laws, where work-like (heat-like) flows stem from effective unitaries (correlations) exerted by one system on the other. We show that the closed and the open approaches only differ by the atom self-work, which yields a tighter expression of the second law. We quantitatively relate this tightening to the extra-knowledge acquired by closing the OBE. The concepts and effects we introduce deepen our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and its potential for energy management at quantum scales. They can be probed in state-of-the-art quantum hardware, e.g. superconducting and photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of levitated nanoparticles via dipole-dipole interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to create and transfer thermal squeezed states and random-phase coherent states in a system of two interacting levitated nanoparticles. In this coupled levitated system, we create a thermal squeezed state of motion in one of the nanoparticles by parametrically driving it and then transferring the state to the other nanoparticle with high fidelity. The transfer mechanism is based on inducing a non-reciprocal type of coupling in the system by suitably modulating the phases of the trapping lasers and the inter-particle distance between the levitated nanoparticles. This non-reciprocal coupling creates a unidirectional channel where information flows from one nanoparticle to the other nanoparticle but not vice versa, thereby allowing for transfer of mechanical states between the nanoparticles with high fidelity. We also affirm this transfer mechanism by creating and efficiently transferring a random-phase coherent state in the coupled levitated system. Further, we make use of the feedback nonlinearity and parametric driving to create simultaneous bistability in the coupled levitated system. Our results may have potential applications in quantum information processing, quantum metrology, and in exploring many-body physics under a controlled environment.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims at extending standard thermodynamics and non-equilibrium statistical physics to systems with sizes well below the thermodynamic limit. A rapidly evolving research field, which promises to change our understanding of the foundations of physics, while enabling the discovery of novel thermodynamic techniques and applications at the nanoscale. Thermal management turned into a major obstacle in pushing the limits of conventional digital computers, and it will represent a crucial issue also for quantum computers. The practical realization of quantum computers with superconducting loops requires working at cryogenic temperatures to eliminate thermal noise; ion-trap qubits need as well low temperatures to minimize collisional noise; in both cases, the sub-nanometric sizes also bring about thermal broadening of the quantum states. A number of thermal and thermodynamic questions therefore take center stage, such as quantum re-definitions of work and heat, thermalization and randomization of quantum states, the overlap of quantum and thermal fluctuations, and many other, even including a proper definition of temperature for the small open systems constantly out of equilibrium that are the qubits. This overview provides an introductory perspective on a selection of current trends in quantum thermodynamics and their impact on quantum computers and quantum computing, with a language accessible also to postgraduate students and researchers from different fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is notorious that quantum mechanics (QM) cannot predict well-defined values for all physical quantities. Less well-known, however, is the fact that QM is unable to furnish probabilistic predictions even in emblematic scenarios such as the double-slit experiment. In contrast, equipped with postulate trajectories, Bohmian mechanics (BM) has inherited more predictive power. It follows that, contrary to common belief, QM and BM are not just different interpretations but distinct theories. This work formalizes the aforementioned assertions and illustrates them through three case studies: (i) free particle, (ii) free fall under a uniform gravitational field, and (iii) the double-slit experiment. Specifically, we introduce a prescription for constructing a flight-time probability distribution within generic trajectory-equipped theories. We then apply our formalism to BM and derive probability distributions that are unreachable by QM. Our results can, in principle, be tested against real experiments, thereby assessing the validity of Bohmian trajectories.</description>

      <title>Floquet expansion by counting pump photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically-driven systems engender a rich competition between the time scales of the drives and those of the system, leading to a limited ability to describe the system in full. We present a framework for the description of interacting bosonic driven systems via a Floquet expansion on top of a quantization that "counts" the drive photons, and provide compelling arguments for the superior performance of our method relative to standard Floquet approaches. Crucially, our approach extends beyond the rotating wave approximation and addresses the long-standing issue of mismatch between the quantum Floquet formalism and its classical counterpart. We, furthermore, pinpoint key corrections to the positions of multiphoton resonances, which are commonly used in the calibration and operation of qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Zero-Level Distillation to Generate High-Fidelity Magic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state distillation plays an important role in universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, and its overhead is one of the major obstacles to realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers. Hence, many studies have been conducted to reduce this overhead. Among these, Litinski has provided a concrete assessment of resource-efficient distillation protocol implementations on the rotated surface code. On the other hand, recently, Itogawa et al. have proposed zero-level distillation, a distillation protocol offering very small spatial and temporal overhead to generate relatively low-fidelity magic states. While zero-level distillation offers preferable spatial and temporal overhead, it cannot directly generate high-fidelity magic states since it only reduces the logical error rate of the magic state quadratically. In this study, we evaluate the spatial and temporal overhead of two-level distillation implementations generating relatively high-fidelity magic states, including ones incorporating zero-level distillation. To this end, we introduce (0+1)-level distillation, a two-level distillation protocol which combines zero-level distillation and the 15-to-1 distillation protocol. We refine the second-level 15-to-1 implementation in it to capitalize on the small footprint of zero-level distillation. Under conditions of a physical error probability of $p_{\mathrm{phys}} = 10^{-4}$ ($10^{-3}$) and targeting an error rate for the magic state within $[5 \times 10^{-17}, 10^{-11}]$ ($[5 \times 10^{-11}, 10^{-8}]$), (0+1)-level distillation reduces the spatiotemporal overhead by more than 63% (61%) compared to the (15-to-1)$\times$(15-to-1) protocol and more than 43% (44%) compared to the (15-to-1)$\times$(20-to-4) protocol, offering a substantial efficiency gain over the traditional protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing our analysis of quantum machine learning applied to our use-case of malware detection, we investigate the potential of quantum convolutional neural networks. More precisely, we propose a new architecture where data is uploaded all along the quantum circuit. This allows us to use more features from the data, hence giving to the algorithm more information, without having to increase the number of qubits that we use for the quantum circuit. This approach is motivated by the fact that we do not always have great amounts of data, and that quantum computers are currently restricted in their number of logical qubits.</description>

      <title>Test of transient deviations from Quantum Mechanics in Bell's experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conflict between Quantum Mechanics (QM) and Local Realism is most noticeable in the correlations observed between distant regions of a spatially spread entangled state. It has been hypothesized that transient deviations (from the values predicted by QM) may be observed if the correlations are measured in a time shorter than L/c, where L is the spatial spread of the entangled state and c is the speed of light. This hypothesis is appealing for it solves that conflict by minimally modifying the interpretation of QM, and opens the door to potentially fruitful nonlinear generalizations of QM without the risk of allowing faster-than-light signaling. The hypothesis is technically impossible to test directly nowadays, but a stroboscopic test is attainable. We present the results of such a test performed on a specially designed optical Bell setup with a distance between stations up to 24 m in straight line. No difference with the same observations performed at short distance, or evidence of transient deviations, is found. Yet, several hypotheses are involved in this experiment; they are detailed and briefly discussed. To say the least, the space left for the hypothesis of transient deviations is much reduced.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear chiral quantum optics with giant-emitter pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a setup which combines giant emitters (coupling to light at multiple points separated by wavelength distances) with nonlinear quantum optics and its correlated photons. In this setup, we reveal a mechanism for multiphoton chiral emission: the propagation phase of the center of mass of two strongly correlated photons (a doublon), and the phases encoded in the coupling points of two giant emitters, can yield completely destructive interference in one propagation direction while supporting emission in the other direction. The degree of chirality can be tuned by the phases of the couplings. We show that the proposed setup can provide directional quantum many-body resources, and can be configured as a building block for a chiral quantum network with ``correlated flying qubits'', enabling distinct applications beyond linear chiral setups. Our findings point toward a rich landscape of tailoring multiphoton propagation and correlation properties by exploiting interference effects of giant emitters coupling to nonlinear photonic baths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete-time Quantum Walks (QWs) are transportation models of single quantum particles over a lattice. Their evolution is driven through causal and local unitary operators. QWs are a powerful tool for quantum simulation of fundamental physics as some of them have a continuum limit converging to well-known physics partial differential equations, such as the Dirac or the Schr\"odinger equation. In this work, we show how to recover the Dirac equation in (3+1)-dimensions with a QW evolving in a tetrahedral space. This paves the way to simulate the Dirac equation on a curved spacetime. This also suggests an ordered scheme for propagating matter over a spin network, of interest in Loop Quantum Gravity where matter propagation has remained an open problem.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast phonon-mediated dephasing of color centers in hexagonal boron nitride probed by electron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride have been extensively studied as room temperature single photon sources. The electronic structure of these defects exhibits strong coupling to phonons, as evidenced by the observation of phonon sidebands in both photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectra. However, the dynamics of the electron phonon coupling as well as phonon mediated dephasing of the color centers in hexagonal boron nitride remain unexplored. Here, we apply a novel time resolved CL spectroscopy technique to explore the population decay to phonon states and the dephasing time T2 with sub femtosecond time resolution. We demonstrate an ultrafast dephasing time of only 200 fs and a radiative decay of about 585 fs at room temperature, in contrast with all optical time resolved photoluminescence techniques that report a decay of a few nanoseconds. This behavior is attributed to efficient electron-beam excitation of coherent phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride, resulting in faster dephasing of electronic transitions. Our results demonstrate the capability of our sequential cathodoluminescence spectroscopy technique to probe the ultrafast dephasing time of single emitters in quantum materials with sub femtosecond time resolution, heralding access to quantum path interferences in single emitters coupled to their complex environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A catalysis state is a quantum state that is used to make some desired operation possible or more efficient, while not being consumed in the process. Recent years have seen catalysis used in state-of-the-art protocols for implementing magic state distillation or small angle phase rotations. In this paper we will see that we can also use catalysis to prove that certain gate sets are computationally universal, and to extend completeness results of graphical languages to larger fragments. In particular, we give a simple proof of the computational universality of the CS+Hadamard gate set using the catalysis of a $T$ gate using a CS gate, which sidesteps the more complicated analytic arguments of the original proof by Kitaev. This then also gives us a simple self-contained proof of the computational universality of Toffoli+Hadamard. Additionally, we show that the phase-free ZH-calculus can be extended to a larger complete fragment, just by using a single catalysis rule (and one scalar rule).</description>

Abstract: Linear systems of equations can be found in various mathematical domains, as well as in the field of machine learning. By employing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, variational solvers promise to accelerate finding solutions for large systems. Although there is a wealth of theoretical research on these algorithms, only fragmentary implementations exist. To fill this gap, we have developed the variational-lse-solver framework, which realizes existing approaches in literature, and introduces several enhancements. The user-friendly interface is designed for researchers that work at the abstraction level of identifying and developing end-to-end applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement model in the de Broglie-Bohm theory is developed. Following von Neumann principles, both the measurement device and the target system are described by the same quantum laws. This investigation includes basic models of coordinates and momentum measurements. Equations for pilot waves are solved analytically, and de Broglie particles trajectories are calculated numerically. The resulting model resolves the issues related to probability distribution in momentum space that were addressed in the works [Kurt Jung 2013 J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 442 012060], [M. Nauenberg 2014 Quanta 3, 43], [D. M. Heim 2022 arXiv:2201.05971v1]. Origin of quantum contextuality in the de Broglie-Bohm theory is discussed. Further, a new problem is considered: whether the de Broglie-Bohm theory admits Heisenberg uncertainty principle in special thought experiment, where momentum and coordinate are measured in turns several times. By direct calculation, we show that uncertainty relation is restored due to turbulence-like perturbations. We consider also the measurement models which do not admit this mechanism and thus may open up new possibilities for experimental testing of the de Broglie-Bohm theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to estimate experimentally the von Neuman entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts for a *single* copy of a prepared state. We use the entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the experimental measurements for this state and the reduced entropy $S_A^X$ obtained by tracing the experimental probabilities over the $B$ half of the system. We conjecture that $S_{A}^{vN}\propto (2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ and demonstrate that it is verified in good approximation using exact diagonalization and analog calculations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms. The approximate proportionality constant is of order one for the examples considered. $2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X$ can be calculated easily for many other qubit platforms and appears to be generically robust under measurement errors, although a general proof remains to be found. Similar results are found for the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Suppression with Subgroup Stabilisation Projectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state purification is the functionality that, given multiple copies of an unknown state, outputs a state with increased purity. This is an essential building block for near- and middle-term quantum ecosystems before the availability of full fault tolerance, where one may want to suppress errors not only in expectation values but also in quantum states. We propose an effective state purification gadget with a moderate quantum overhead by projecting $M$ noisy quantum inputs to their symmetric subspace defined by a set of projectors forming a symmetric subgroup with order $M$. Our method, applied in every short evolution over $M$ redundant copies of noisy states, can suppress both coherent and stochastic errors by a factor of $1/M$. This reduces the circuit implementation cost $M$ times smaller than the state projection to the full symmetric subspace proposed more than two decades ago by Barenco et al. We also show that our gadget purifies the depolarised inputs with probability $p$ to asymptotically $O\left(p^{2}\right)$ with an optimal choice of $M$ when $p$ is small. Our method provides flexible choices of state purification depending on the hardware restrictions before fully fault-tolerant computing is available. Our method may also find its application in designing robust verification protocols for quantum outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on max-min fairness in entanglement distribution and compare the performance of various spectrum allocation schemes by examining the max-min and median number of EPR-pairs assigned by them, and the Jain index associated with this assignment. Since this presents an NP-hard problem, we identify two approximation algorithms that outperform others in minimum and mean EPR-pair rate distribution and are comparable to others in the Jain index. We also analyze how the network size and connectivity affect these metrics using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves high minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and runtimes are considered.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear phenomena represent one of the central topics in the study of wave-matter interactions and constitute the key blocks for various applications in optical communication, computing, sensing, and imaging. In this work, we show that by employing the interactions between microwave photons and electron spins of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, one can realize a variety of nonlinear effects, ranging from the resonance at the sum or difference frequency of two or more waves to electromagnetically induced transparency from the interference between spin transitions. We further verify the phase coherence through two-photon Rabi-oscillation measurements. The highly sensitive, optically detected NV-center dynamics not only provides a platform for studying magnetically induced nonlinearities but also promises novel functionalities in quantum control and quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the relation between the star exponentials emerging within the Deformation Quantization formalism and Feynman's path integrals associated with propagators in quantum dynamics. In order to obtain such a relation, we start by visualizing the quantum propagator as an integral transform of the star exponential by means of the symbol corresponding to the time evolution operator and, thus, we introduce Feynman's path integral representation of the propagator as a sum over all the classical histories. The star exponential thus constructed has the advantage that it does not depend on the convergence of formal series, as commonly understood within the context of Deformation Quantization. We include some basic examples to illustrate our findings, recovering standard results reported in the literature. Further, for an arbitrary finite dimensional system, we use the star exponential introduced here in order to find a particular representation of the star product which resembles the one encountered in the context of the quantum field theory for a Poisson sigma model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of quantum transport in nanostructures can be tailored by a time-dependent bias voltage $V(t)$. We demonstrate experimentally how correlations of current fluctuations at two different times $t$ and $t+\tau$ depend on the shape of $V(t)$ via the phase accumulated by the electronic wavefunctions between $t$ and $t+\tau$. For this we measure the current-current correlation of the shot noise of an ac+dc biased tunnel junction using a 10 GHz bandwidth, time-resolved detection. Our result allows to explore correlations within a single excitation period. It demonstrates the counterpart of the ac Josephson effect in superconducting junctions, to a normal, non-superconducting mesoscopic device.</description>

We implement a physics-informed and an adaptive Bayesian estimation strategy and apply them in real time to a semiconductor spin qubit. The physics-informed strategy propagates a probability distribution inside the quantum controller according to the Fokker-Planck equation, appropriate for describing the effects of nuclear spin diffusion in gallium-arsenide. Evaluating and narrowing the anticipated distribution by a predetermined qubit probe sequence enables improved dynamical tracking of the uncontrolled magnetic field gradient within the singlet-triplet qubit. The adaptive strategy replaces the probe sequence by a small number of qubit probe cycles, with each probe time conditioned on the previous measurement outcomes, thereby further increasing the estimation efficiency. The combined real-time estimation strategy efficiently tracks low-frequency nuclear spin fluctuations in solid-state qubits, and can be applied to other qubit platforms by tailoring the appropriate update equation to capture their distinct noise sources.</description>

      <title>Improved Optimization for the Neural-network Quantum States and Tests on the Chromium Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Neural-network Quantum States (NQS) has significantly advanced wave function ansatz research, sparking a resurgence in orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC) exploration. This work introduces three algorithmic enhancements to reduce computational demands of VMC optimization using NQS: an adaptive learning rate algorithm, constrained optimization, and block optimization. We evaluate the refined algorithm on complex multireference bond stretches of $\rm H_2O$ and $\rm N_2$ within the cc-pVDZ basis set and calculate the ground-state energy of the strongly correlated chromium dimer ($\rm Cr_2$) in the Ahlrichs SV basis set. Our results achieve superior accuracy compared to coupled cluster theory at a relatively modest CPU cost. This work demonstrates how to enhance optimization efficiency and robustness using these strategies, opening a new path to optimize large-scale Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-based NQS more effectively and marking a substantial advancement in NQS's practical quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Miscibility of Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates with $p$-wave Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a binary mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with competing interspecies $s$- and $p$-wave interactions. Exploiting a pseudopotential model for the $l=1$ partial wave, we derive an extended Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation for the BEC mixture that incorporates both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions. Based on it, we study the miscible-immiscible transition of a binary BEC mixture in the presence of interspecies $p$-wave interaction, by combining numerical solution of the GP equation and Gaussian variational analysis. Our study uncovers a dual effect -- either enhance or reduce miscibility -- of positive interspecies $p$-wave interaction, which can be precisely controlled by adjusting relevant experimental parameters. By complete characterizing the miscibility phase diagram, we establish a promising avenue towards experimental control of the miscibility of binary BEC mixtures via high partial-wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Exclusive-or encoded algebraic structure for efficient quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formalism that captures the algebraic structure of many-body two-level quantum systems, and directly motivates an efficient numerical method. This formalism is based on the binary representation of the enumeration-indices of the elements of the corresponding Lie algebra. The action of arbitrarily large elements of that algebra reduces to a few bit-wise exclusive-or operations. This formalism naturally produces sparse representations of many-body density operators, the size of which we control through a dynamic truncation method. We demonstrate how this formalism applies to real-time evolution, dissipative Lindblad action, imaginary-time evolution, and projective measurement processes. We find that this approach to calculating quantum dynamics scales close to linearly with the number of non-zero components in the density operator. We refer to this exclusive-or represented quantum algebra as ORQA. As a proof of concept, we provide a numerical demonstration of this formalism by simulating quantum annealing processes for the maximum independent set problem for up to 22 two-level systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To meet the increasing demand of quantum chemistry calculations in data-driven chemical research, the collaboration between industrial stakeholders and the quantum chemistry community has led to the development of GPU4PySCF, a GPU-accelerated Python package. This open-source project is accessible via its public GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf}. This paper outlines the primary features, innovations, and advantages of this package. When performing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on modern GPU platforms, GPU4PySCF delivers 30 times speedup over a 32-core CPU node, resulting in approximately 90% cost savings for most DFT tasks. The performance advantages and productivity improvements have been found in multiple industrial applications, such as generating potential energy surfaces, analyzing molecular properties, calculating solvation free energy, identifying chemical reactions in lithium-ion batteries, and accelerating neural-network methods. To make the package easy to extend and integrate with other Python packages, it is designed with PySCF-compatible interfaces and Pythonic implementations. This design choice enhances its coordination with the Python ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Real Materials on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers (QC) could harbor the potential to significantly advance materials simulations, particularly at the atomistic scale involving strongly correlated fermionic systems where an accurate description of quantum many-body effects scales unfavorably with size. While a full-scale treatment of condensed matter systems with currently available noisy quantum computers remains elusive, quantum embedding schemes like dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) allow the mapping of an effective, reduced subspace Hamiltonian to available devices to improve the accuracy of ab initio calculations such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we report on the development of a hybrid quantum-classical DFT+DMFT simulation framework which relies on a quantum impurity solver based on the Lehmann representation of the impurity Green's function. Hardware experiments with up to 14 qubits on the IBM Quantum system are conducted, using advanced error mitigation methods and a novel calibration scheme for an improved zero-noise extrapolation to effectively reduce adverse effects from inherent noise on current quantum devices. We showcase the utility of our quantum DFT+DMFT workflow by assessing the correlation effects on the electronic structure of a real material, Ca2CuO2Cl2, and by carefully benchmarking our quantum results with respect to exact reference solutions and experimental spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>Microwave Hall measurements using a circularly polarized dielectric cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of $\pm\pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single crystal of metals in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the right- and left-handed circularly polarization modes. To verify the validity of the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum materials, such as time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector magnetometry is an essential tool in characterizing the distribution of currents and magnetization in a broad range of systems. Point defect sensors, like the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, have demonstrated impressive sensitivity and spatial resolution for detecting these fields. Measuring the vector field at a single point in space using single defects, however, remains an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate that careful optimization of the static bias field can enable simultaneous measurement of multiple magnetic field components with enhanced sensitivity by leveraging the nonlinear Zeeman shift from transverse magnetic fields. This work quantifies the trade-off between the increased frequency shift from second-order Zeeman effects with decreasing contrast as off-axis field components increase, demonstrating the measurement of multiple components of the magnetic field from an exemplar antiferromagnet with a complex magnetic texture.</description>

Abstract: High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and optical tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, which can significantly limit the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4 us single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4% fidelity. Additionally, we resolve lattice sites spaced within the diffraction limit by using accordion lattices to increase the atom spacing before imaging. This overcomes the challenge of imaging small-spacing lattices and enables the study of extended Hubbard models using magnetic atoms. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum-Classical (HQC) Architectures are used in near-term NISQ Quantum Computers for solving Quantum Machine Learning problems. The quantum advantage comes into picture due to the exponential speedup offered over classical computing. One of the major challenges in implementing such algorithms is the choice of quantum embeddings and the use of a functionally correct quantum variational circuit. In this paper, we present an application of QSVM (Quantum Support Vector Machines) to predict if a person will require mental health treatment in the tech world in the future using the dataset from OSMI Mental Health Tech Surveys. We achieve this with non-classically simulable feature maps and prove that NISQ HQC Architectures for Quantum Machine Learning can be used alternatively to create good performance models in near-term real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.03333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating physical properties of quantum states from measurements is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum science. In this work, we identify conditions on states under which it is possible to infer the expectation values of all quasi-local observables of a state from a number of copies that scales polylogarithmically with the system's size and polynomially on the locality of the target observables. We show that this constitutes a provable exponential improvement in the number of copies over state-of-the-art tomography protocols. We achieve our results by combining the maximum entropy method with tools from the emerging fields of classical shadows and quantum optimal transport. The latter allows us to fine-tune the error made in estimating the expectation value of an observable in terms of how local it is and how well we approximate the expectation value of a fixed set of few-body observables. We conjecture that our condition holds for all states exhibiting some form of decay of correlations and establish it for several subsets thereof. These include widely studied classes of states such as one-dimensional thermal and high-temperature Gibbs states of local commuting Hamiltonians on arbitrary hypergraphs or outputs of shallow circuits. Moreover, we show improvements of the maximum entropy method beyond the sample complexity that are of independent interest. These include identifying regimes in which it is possible to perform the postprocessing efficiently as well as novel bounds on the condition number of covariance matrices of many-body states.</description>

Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is a universal model for quantum computing whose implementation using a gate-based quantum computer requires depths that are unreachable in the early fault-tolerant era. To mitigate the limitations of near-term devices, a number of hybrid approaches have been pursued in which a parameterized quantum circuit prepares and measures quantum states and a classical optimization algorithm minimizes an objective function that encompasses the solution to the problem of interest. In this work, we propose a different approach starting by analyzing how a small perturbation of a Hamiltonian affects the parameters that minimize the energy within a family of parameterized quantum states. We derive a set of equations that allow us to compute the new minimum by solving a constrained linear system of equations that is obtained from measuring a series of observables on the unperturbed system. We then propose a discrete version of adiabatic quantum computing that can be implemented in a near-term device while at the same time is insensitive to the initialization of the parameters and to other limitations hindered in the optimization part of variational quantum algorithms. We compare our proposed algorithm with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver on two classical optimization problems, namely MaxCut and Number Partitioning, and on a quantum-spin configuration problem, the Transverse-Field Ising Chain model, and confirm that our approach demonstrates superior performance.</description>

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements are a key component in many quantum information computing protocols, including quantum error correction, fault-tolerant logical operations, and measurement based quantum computing. As such, techniques to quickly and efficiently characterize or benchmark their performance are of great interest. Beyond the measured qubit, it is also relevant to determine what, if any, impact mid-circuit measurement has on adjacent, unmeasured, spectator qubits. Here, we present a mid-circuit measurement benchmarking suite developed from the ubiquitous paradigm of randomized benchmarking. We show how our benchmarking suite can be used to both detect as well as quantify errors on both measured and spectator qubits, including measurement-induced errors on spectator qubits and entangling errors between measured and spectator qubits. We demonstrate the scalability of our suite by simultaneously characterizing mid-circuit measurement on multiple qubits from an IBM Quantum Falcon device, and support our experimental results with numerical simulations. Further, using a mid-circuit measurement tomography protocol we establish the nature of the errors identified by our benchmarking suite.</description>

Abstract: In chemistry, a catalyst is a substance which enables a chemical reaction or increases its rate, while remaining unchanged in the process. Instead of chemical reactions, quantum catalysis enhances our ability to convert quantum states into each other under physical constraints. The nature of the constraints depends on the problem under study and can arise, e.g., from energy preservation. This article reviews the most recent developments in quantum catalysis and gives a historical overview of this research direction. We focus on the catalysis of quantum entanglement and coherence, and also discuss this phenomenon in quantum thermodynamics and general quantum resource theories. We review applications of quantum catalysis and also discuss the recent efforts on universal catalysis, where the quantum state of the catalyst does not depend on the states to be transformed. Catalytic embezzling is also considered, a phenomenon that occurs if the catalyst's state can change in the transition.</description>

      <title>Exponential concentration in quantum kernel methods</title>

Abstract: Kernel methods in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) have recently gained significant attention as a potential candidate for achieving a quantum advantage in data analysis. Among other attractive properties, when training a kernel-based model one is guaranteed to find the optimal model's parameters due to the convexity of the training landscape. However, this is based on the assumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from quantum hardware. In this work we study the performance of quantum kernel models from the perspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values. We show that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over different input data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of qubits) towards some fixed value. Thus on training with a polynomial number of measurements, one ends up with a trivial model where the predictions on unseen inputs are independent of the input data. We identify four sources that can lead to concentration including: expressivity of data embedding, global measurements, entanglement and noise. For each source, an associated concentration bound of quantum kernels is analytically derived. Lastly, we show that when dealing with classical data, training a parametrized data embedding with a kernel alignment method is also susceptible to exponential concentration. Our results are verified through numerical simulations for several QML tasks. Altogether, we provide guidelines indicating that certain features should be avoided to ensure the efficient evaluation of quantum kernels and so the performance of quantum kernel methods.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenon of quantum superposition manifests in two distinct ways: it either spreads out across non-orthogonal basis states or remains concealed within their overlaps. Despite its profound implications, the resource theory of superposition often neglects the quantum superposition residing within these overlaps. However, this component is intricately linked to a form of state indistinguishability and can give rise to quantum correlations. In this paper, we introduce a pseudo-Hermitian representation of the density operator, wherein its diagonal elements correspond to biorthogonal extensions of Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-probabilities. This representation provides a unified framework for the inter-basis quantum superposition and basis state indistinguishability, giving rise to what we term as \textit{genuine} quantum superposition. Moreover, we propose appropriate generalizations of current superposition measures to quantify genuine quantum superposition that serves as the fundamental notion of nonclassicality from which both quantum coherence and correlations emerge. Finally, we explore potential applications of our theoretical framework, particularly in the quantification of electron delocalization in chemical bonding and aromaticity.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of input-output indefiniteness in a single quantum device</title>

Abstract: Quantum theory allows information to flow through a single device in a coherent superposition of two opposite directions, resulting into situations where the input-output direction is indefinite. Here we introduce a theoretical method to witness input-output indefiniteness in a single quantum device, and we experimentally demonstrate it by constructing a photonic setup that exhibits input-output indefiniteness with a statistical significance exceeding 69 standard deviations. Our results provide a way to characterize input-output indefiniteness as a resource for quantum information and photonic quantum technologies and enable table-top simulations of hypothetical scenarios exhibiting quantum indefiniteness in the direction of time.</description>

      <title>Is there a finite complete set of monotones in any quantum resource theory?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement quantification aims to assess the value of quantum states for quantum information processing tasks. A closely related problem is state convertibility, asking whether two remote parties can convert a shared quantum state into another one without exchanging quantum particles. Here, we explore this connection for quantum entanglement and for general quantum resource theories. For any quantum resource theory which contains resource-free pure states, we show that there does not exist a finite set of resource monotones which completely determines all state transformations. We discuss how these limitations can be surpassed, if discontinuous or infinite sets of monotones are considered, or by using quantum catalysis. We also discuss the structure of theories which are described by a single resource monotone and show equivalence with totally ordered resource theories. These are theories where a free transformation exists for any pair of quantum states. We show that totally ordered theories allow for free transformations between all pure states. For single-qubit systems, we provide a full characterization of state transformations for any totally ordered resource theory.</description>

      <title>Achieving metrological limits using ancilla-free quantum error-correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is theoretically capable of achieving the ultimate estimation limits in noisy quantum metrology. However, existing quantum error-correcting codes designed for noisy quantum metrology generally exploit entanglement between one probe and one noiseless ancilla of the same dimension, and the requirement of noiseless ancillas is one of the major obstacles to implementing the QEC metrological protocol in practice. Here we successfully lift this requirement by explicitly constructing two types of multi-probe quantum error-correcting codes, where the first one utilizes a negligible amount of ancillas and the second one is ancilla-free. Specifically, we consider Hamiltonian estimation under Markovian noise and show that (i)~when the Heisenberg limit (HL) is achievable, our new codes can achieve the HL and its optimal asymptotic coefficient; (ii)~when only the standard quantum limit (SQL) is achievable (even with arbitrary adaptive quantum strategies), the optimal asymptotic coefficient of the SQL is also achievable by our new codes under slight modifications.</description>

Abstract: The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code may be used to overcome noise in continuous variable quantum systems. However, preparing GKP states remains experimentally challenging. We propose a method for preparing GKP states by engineering a time-periodic Hamiltonian whose Floquet states are GKP states. This Hamiltonian may be realized in a superconducting circuit comprising a SQUID shunted by a superinductor and a capacitor, with a characteristic impedance twice the resistance quantum. The GKP Floquet states can be prepared by adiabatically tuning the frequency of the external magnetic flux drive. We predict that highly squeezed $&gt;11.9$ dB ($10.8$ dB) GKP magic states can be prepared on a microsecond timescale, given a quality factor of $10^6$ ($10^5$) and flux noise at typical rates.</description>

      <title>Embedding Quantum Many-Body Scars into Decoherence-Free Subspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal excited eigenstates of non-integrable Hamiltonians, which could support coherent revival dynamics from special initial states when scars form an equally spaced tower in the energy spectrum. For open quantum systems, engineering many-body scarred dynamics by a controlled coupling to the environment remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a general framework to exactly embed quantum many-body scars into the decoherence-free subspaces of Lindblad master equations. The dissipative scarred dynamics manifest persistent periodic oscillations for generic initial states, and can be practically utilized to prepare scar states with potential quantum metrology applications.We construct the Liouvillian dissipators with the local projectors that annihilate the whole scar towers, and utilize the Hamiltonian part to rotate the undesired states out of the null space of dissipators. We demonstrate our protocol through several typical models hosting many-body scar towers, and propose an experimental scheme to observe the dissipative scarred dynamics based on digital quantum simulations and resetting ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>Lifting topological codes: Three-dimensional subsystem codes from two-dimensional anyon models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological subsystem codes in three spatial dimensions allow for quantum error correction with no time overhead, even in the presence of measurement noise. The physical origins of this single-shot property remain elusive, in part due to the scarcity of known models. To address this challenge, we provide a systematic construction of a class of topological subsystem codes in three dimensions built from abelian quantum double models in one fewer dimension. Our construction not only generalizes the recently introduced subsystem toric code [Kubica and Vasmer, Nat. Commun. 13, 6272 (2022)] but also provides a new perspective on several aspects of the original model, including the origin of the Gauss law for gauge flux, and boundary conditions for the code family. We then numerically study the performance of the first few codes in this class against phenomenological noise to verify their single-shot property. Lastly, we discuss Hamiltonians naturally associated with these codes, and argue that they may be gapless.</description>

Abstract: We argue that it is generally nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian states (NSLG) rather than the Landau ones that appropriately describe electrons with orbital angular momentum both in their dynamics at a hard-edge boundary between a solenoid and vacuum and inside the magnetic field. It is shown that the r.m.s. radius of the NSLG state oscillates in time and its period-averaged value can significantly exceed the r.m.s. radius of the Landau state, even far from the boundary. We propose to study the unconventional features of quantum dynamics inside a solenoid in several experimental scenarios with vortex electrons described by the NSLG states. Relevance for processes in scanning and transmission electron microscopes, as well as for particle accelerators with relativistic beams is emphasized.</description>

Abstract: This letter investigates the applications and extensions of the resource theory of quantum superposition within the realm of quantum chemistry. Specifically, we explore aromaticity, a fundamental concept originally developed to elucidate the structural symmetry, energetic stability, and chemical reactivity of benzene and its derivatives. While aromaticity and its counterpart, antiaromaticity, are associated with the delocalization of electrons between nonorthogonal atomic orbitals, they lack a universally accepted and comprehensive definition. We demonstrate that the genuine quantum superposition exhibited by biorthogonal atomic orbitals effectively captures the aromaticity order of representative monocyclic molecules. These findings reveal that the quantum resource theories hold significant implications, offering fresh insights into our comprehension of chemical bonding phenomena.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Gate Set Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering quantum devices requires reliable characterization of the quantum system, including qubits, quantum operations (also known as instruments) and the quantum noise. Recently, quantum gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a powerful technique for self-consistently describing quantum states, gates, and measurements. However, non-Markovian correlations between the quantum system and environment impact the reliability of GST. To address this, we propose a self-consistent operational framework called instrument set tomography (IST) for non-Markovian GST. Based on the stochastic quantum process, the instrument set describes instruments and system-environment (SE) correlations. We introduce a linear inversion IST (LIST) to describe instruments and SE correlations without physical constraints. The disharmony of linear relationships between instruments is detected. Furthermore, we propose a physically constrained statistical method based on the maximum likelihood estimation for IST (MLE-IST) with adjustable dimensions. MLE-IST shows significant flexibility in adapting to different types of devices, such as noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, by adjusting the model and constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of simultaneously describing instruments and SE correlations. Remarkably, real-chip experiments indicate that a polynomial number of parameters with respect to the Markovian order are sufficient to characterize non-Markovian quantum noise in current NISQ devices. Consequently, IST provides an essential and self-consistent framework for characterizing, benchmarking, and developing quantum devices in terms of the instrument set.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new family of permutationally invariant codes that correct $t$ Pauli errors for any $t\ge 1$. We also show that codes in the new family correct quantum deletion errors as well as spontaneous decay errors. Our construction contains some of the previously known permutationally invariant quantum codes as particular cases, which also admit transversal gates. In many cases, the codes in the new family are shorter than the best previously known explicit permutationally invariant codes for Pauli errors and deletions. Furthermore, our new code family includes a new $((4,2,2))$ optimal single-deletion-correcting code. As a separate result, we generalize the conditions for permutationally invariant codes to correct $t$ Pauli errors from the previously known results for $t=1$ to any number of errors. For small $t$, these conditions can be used to construct new examples of codes by computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and effective method to create highly entangled spin states on a faster timescale than that of the commonly employed one-axis twisting (OAT) model. We demonstrate that by periodically driving the Dicke Hamiltonian at a resonance frequency, the system effectively becomes a two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian which is known to quickly create Heisenberg limit scaled entangled states. For these states we show that simple quadrature measurements can saturate the ultimate precision limit for parameter estimation determined by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. An example experimental realization of the periodically driven scheme is discussed with the potential to quickly generate momentum entanglement in a recently described experimental vertical cavity system. We analyze effects of collective dissipation in this vertical cavity system and find that our squeezing protocol can be more robust than the previous realization of OAT.</description>

Abstract: The prediction of photon echoes is a crucial technique for gaining an understanding of optical quantum systems. However, it requires a large number of simulations with varying parameters and/or input pulses, which renders numerical studies expensive. This article investigates how we can use data-driven surrogate models based on the Koopman operator to accelerate this process while maintaining accuracy over a large number of time steps. To this end, we employ a bilinear Koopman model using extended dynamic mode decomposition and simulate the optical Bloch equations for an ensemble of inhomogeneously broadened two-level systems. Such systems are well suited to describe the excitation of excitonic resonances in semiconductor nanostructures, for example, ensembles of semiconductor quantum dots. We perform a detailed study on the required number of system simulations such that the resulting data-driven Koopman model is sufficiently accurate for a wide range of parameter settings. We analyze the L2 error and the relative error of the photon echo peak and investigate how the control positions relate to the stabilization. After proper training, our methods can predict the quantum ensemble's dynamics accurately and numerically efficiently.</description>

Abstract: Let $n\geq 8$ be divisible by 4. The Clifford-cyclotomic gate set $\mathcal{G}_n$ is the universal gate set obtained by extending the Clifford gates with the $z$-rotation $T_n = \mathrm{diag}(1,\zeta_n)$, where $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity. In this note, we show that, when $n$ is a power of 2, a multiqubit unitary matrix $U$ can be exactly represented by a circuit over $\mathcal{G}_n$ if and only if the entries of $U$ belong to the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_n]$. We moreover show that $\log(n)-2$ ancillas are always sufficient to construct a circuit for $U$. Our results generalize prior work to an infinite family of gate sets and show that the limitations that apply to single-qubit unitaries, for which the correspondence between Clifford-cyclotomic operators and matrices over $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_n]$ fails for all but finitely many values of $n$, can be overcome through the use of ancillas.</description>

Abstract: The effect of quantum steering describes a possible action at a distance via local measurements. In the last few years, several criteria have been proposed to detect this type of correlation in quantum systems. However, there are few approaches presented in order to measure the degree of steerability of a given system. In this work, we are interested in investigating possible ways to quantify quantum steering, where we based our analysis on different criteria presented in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, an exact analytic solution is presented for the coherent population transfer and the arbitrary coherent superposition in five-state chainwise system by coincident pulses technique. We show that the solution of a five-state chainwise system can be reduced to an equivalent three-state $\Lambda$-type one with the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of adiabatic elimination (AE) together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident pulses. In this method, all of four incident pulses at each step all have the same time dependence, but with specific magnitudes. The results show that, by using multiple pairs of appropriately coincident incident pulses, this technique enables complete population transfer, as well as the creation of arbitrary desired coherent superposition between initial and final states, while the population in all intermediate states is effectively suppressed. The complete physical explanation of the underlying mechanism is presented. The results are of potential interest in applications where high-fidelity multi-state quantum control is essential, e.g., quantum information, atom optics, formation of ultracold molecules, cavity QED, nuclear coherent population transfer, light transfer in waveguide arrays, etc.</description>

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods leverage a kernel function computed by embedding input information into the Hilbert space of a quantum system. However, large Hilbert spaces can hinder generalization capability, and the scalability of quantum kernels becomes an issue. To overcome these challenges, various strategies under the concept of inductive bias have been proposed. Bandwidth optimization is a promising approach that can be implemented using quantum simulation platforms. We propose trapped-ion simulation platforms as a means to compute quantum kernels and demonstrate their effectiveness for binary classification tasks. We compare the performance of the proposed method with an optimized classical kernel and evaluate the robustness of the quantum kernel against noise. The results show that ion trap platforms are well-suited for quantum kernel computation and can achieve high accuracy with only a few qubits.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead Parallelisation of LCU via Commuting Operators</title>

Abstract: The Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method is a powerful scheme for the block encoding of operators but suffers from high overheads. In this work, we discuss the parallelisation of LCU and in particular the SELECT subroutine of LCU based on partitioning of observables into groups of commuting operators, as well as the use of adaptive circuits and teleportation that allow us to perform required Clifford circuits in constant depth. We additionally discuss the parallelisation of QROM circuits which are a special case of our main results, and provide methods to parallelise the action of multi-controlled gates on the control register. We only require an $O(\log n)$ factor increase in the number of qubits in order to produce a significant depth reduction, with prior work suggesting that for molecular Hamiltonians, the depth saving is $O(n)$, and numerics indicating depth savings of a factor approximately $n/2$. The implications of our method in the fault-tolerant setting are also considered, noting that parallelisation reduces the $T$-depth by the same factor as the logical algorithm, without changing the $T$-count, and that our method can significantly reduce the overall space-time volume of the computation, even when including the increased number of $T$ factories required by parallelisation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Model of Qudit Measurement for Superconducting Quantum Information Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of superconducting quantum computing, based on Josephson junctions, has recently seen remarkable strides in scaling the number of logical qubits. In particular, the fidelities of one- and two-qubit gates are close to the breakeven point with the novel error mitigation and correction methods. Parallel to these advances is the effort to expand the Hilbert space within a single device by employing high-dimensional qubits, otherwise known as qudits. Research has demonstrated the possibility of driving higher-order transitions in a transmon or designing innovative multimode superconducting circuits, termed multimons. These advances can significantly expand the computational basis while simplifying the interconnects in a large-scale quantum processor. This thesis provides a detailed introduction to the superconducting qudit and demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of decoherence in an artificial atom with more than two levels using Lindblad master equations and stochastic master equations (SMEs). After extending the theory of the design, control, and readout of a conventional superconducting qubit to that of a qudit, the thesis focuses on modeling the dispersive measurement of a transmon qutrit in an open quantum system using quadrature detections. Under the Markov assumption, master equations with different levels of abstraction are proposed and solved; in addition, both the ensemble-averaged and the quantum-jump approach of decoherence analysis are presented and compared analytically and numerically. The thesis ends with a series of experimental results on a transmon-type qutrit, verifying the validity of the stochastic model.</description>

      <title>Mass Ratio Dependence of Three-Body Resonance Lifetimes in 1D and 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of resonance lifetimes in a two-component three-body system, specifically examining the decay of three-body resonances into a deep dimer and an unbound particle. Utilising the Gaussian expansion method together with the complex scaling method, we obtain the widths of these resonances from first principles. We focus on mass ratios in the typical range for mixtures of ultracold atoms and reveal an intriguing dependence of the resonance widths on the mass ratio: as the mass ratio increases, the widths exhibit oscillations on top of an overall decreasing trend. In particular, for some mass ratios the resonance width vanishes, implying that the resonance becomes in fact stable. Notably, near the mass ratio for Caesium-Lithium mixtures, we obtain nearly vanishing widths of the resonances which validates to treat them in the bound-state approximation. In addition, we perform our analysis of the resonance widths in both one and three dimensions and find a qualitatively similar dependence on the mass ratio.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of entangled subspaces -- completely entangled subspaces of entanglement depth $k$ ($k$-CESs). These are subspaces of multipartite Hilbert spaces containing only pure states with the entanglement depth at least $k$. We present an efficient construction of $k$-CESs of any achievable dimensionality in any multipartite scenario. Further, we discuss the relation between these subspaces and unextendible product bases (UPBs). In particular, we establish that there is a non-trivial bound on the cardinality of a UPB whose orthocomplement is a $k$-CES. Further, we discuss existence of such UPBs for qubit systems.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the spectrum of the transition matrix for simple random walk on graphs consisting of a finite graph with a finite number of infinite Cayley trees attached. We show that there is a continuous spectrum identical to that for a Cayley tree and, in general, a non-empty pure point spectrum. We apply our results to studying continuous time quantum walk on these graphs. If the pure point spectrum is nonempty the walk is in general confined with a nonzero probability.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and Characterization of Transmon Qutrits Through Bayesian Experimental Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust control of a quantum system is essential to utilize the current noisy quantum hardware to their full potential, such as quantum algorithms. To achieve such a goal, systematic search for an optimal control for any given experiment is essential. Design of optimal control pulses require accurate numerical models, and therefore, accurate characterization of the system parameters. We present an online, Bayesian approach for quantum characterization of qutrit systems which automatically and systematically identifies the optimal experiments that provide maximum information on the system parameters, thereby greatly reducing the number of experiments that need to be performed on the quantum testbed. Unlike most characterization protocols that provide point-estimates of the parameters, the proposed approach is able to estimate their probability distribution. The applicability of the Bayesian experimental design technique was demonstrated on test problems where each experiment was defined by a parameterized control pulse. In addition to this, we also presented an approach for iterative pulse extension which is robust under uncertainties in transition frequencies and coherence times, and shot noise, despite being initialized with wide uninformative priors. Furthermore, we provide a mathematical proof of the theoretical identifiability of the model parameters and present conditions on the quantum state under which the parameters are identifiable. The proof and conditions for identifiability are presented for both closed and open quantum systems using the Schroedinger equation and the Lindblad master equation respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introducing an active space approximation is inevitable for the quantum computations of chemical systems. However, this approximation ignores the electron correlations related to non-active orbitals. Here, we propose a computational method for correcting quantum computing results using a well-established classical theory called coupled cluster theory. Our approach efficiently extracts the quantum state from a quantum device by computational basis tomography. The extracted expansion coefficients of the quantum state are embedded into the coupled cluster ansatz within the framework of the tailored coupled cluster method. We demonstrate the performance of our method by verifying the potential energy curves of LiH, H2O, and N2 with a correlation-energy correction scheme. Our method demonstrates reasonable potential energy curves even when the standard coupled cluster fails. The sufficient numbers of measurements for tomography were also investigated. Furthermore, this method successfully estimated the activation energy of the Cope rearrangement reaction of 1,5-hexadiene together with perturbative triples correction. These demonstrations suggest that our approach has the potential for practical quantum chemical calculations using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Periodically Driven Open Quantum Systems: Spectral Properties and Non-Equilibrium Steady States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate periodically driven open quantum systems within the framework of Floquet-Lindblad master equations. Specifically, we discuss Lindblad master equations in the presence of a coherent, time-periodic driving and establish their general spectral features. We also clarify the notions of transient and non-decaying solutions from this spectral perspective, and then prove that any physical system described by a Floquet-Lindblad equation must have at least one \textit{physical} non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), corresponding to an eigenoperator of the Floquet-Lindblad evolution superoperator $\mathcal{U}_F$ with unit eigenvalue. Since the Floquet-Lindblad formalism encapsulates the entire information regarding the NESS, it in principle enables us to obtain non-linear effects to all orders at once. The Floquet-Lindblad formalism thus provides a powerful tool for studying driven-dissipative solid-state systems, which we illustrate by deriving the nonlinear optical response of a simple two-band model of an insulating solid and comparing it with prior results established through Keldysh techniques.</description>

Abstract: Entangled states with both multiple local levels and multiple subsystems is increasingly entering state-of-the-art quantum technology. We investigate whether such high-dimensional multipartite entangled states can be simulated using only low-dimensional entanglement. To this end, we propose to benchmark the multipartite entanglement dimensionality via the worst-case bipartite entanglement dimension needed to generate the state as a mixture over the different bisections of the system. In order to detect this genuinely high-dimensional and genuinely multipartite entanglement, we develop several classes of general criteria. They are respectively based on fidelity measurements, efficient fidelity estimation using only a minimal number of measurements and convex programming methods. Our approach is a step towards understanding the role of entanglement dimensionality beyond the well-studied bipartite systems and our methods readily lend themselves to high-dimensional multipartite entanglement experiments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Degradation in Causal Diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement degradation appears to be a generic prediction in relativistic quantum information whenever horizons restrict access to a region of spacetime. This property has been previously explored in connection with the Unruh effect, where a bipartite entangled system composed of an inertial observer (Alice) and a uniformly accelerated observer (Rob) was studied, with entanglement degradation caused by the relative acceleration -- and with equivalent results for the case when Alice is freely falling into a black hole and Rob experiences a constant proper acceleration as a stationary near-horizon observer. In this work, we show that a similar degradation also occurs in the case of an entangled system composed of an inertial observer (Alice) and a "diamond observer" (Dave) with a finite lifetime. The condition of a finite lifetime is equivalent to the restriction of Dave's access within a causal diamond. Specifically, if the system starts in a maximally entangled state, prepared from Alice's perspective, entanglement degradation is enforced by the presence of the diamond's causal horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the anharmonic signatures in dissipative polaritons' stationary energy distribution and thermodynamics under external periodic driving. First, we introduce a dynamic model for the dissipative anharmonic Jaynes-Cummings polariton with a generic time-periodic interaction representing modulations of the polariton's energy due to an external force or field. We characterize the stationary state in terms of the exciton, phonon, and interaction energy dependence on the phonon anharmonicity, exciton-phonon coupling strength, and intensity and form of the external field-polariton coupling. Our model also captures the quantum thermodynamics of the driven polariton, which we analyze in connection with the irreversible heat, maximum power, and efficiency of the process. We find considerable differences in energy distribution and thermodynamics between harmonic, moderate, and strongly anharmonic polaritons. Moreover, comparing the external modulations to the phonon and exciton energy, we conclude that the former enhances the polariton's energy storage capacity and is occasionally limited by interference effects and energy saturation at the exciton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the practical limitations of solid-state superconducting quantum processors technology is frequency crowding due to low qubits fabrication reproducibility. Josephson junction 100 nm-scale nonlinear inductance of the qubits still suffers from Dolan-bridge shadow evaporation process. Here, we report on a robust wafer-scale Al/AlOx/Al Dolan-bridge Josephson junction (JJ) process using preliminary shadow evaporation bias resist mask correction and comprehensive oxidation optimization. We introduce topology correction model for two-layer resist mask biasing at a wafer-scale, which takes into account an evaporation source geometry. It results in Josephson junction area variation coefficient improvement down to 1.1% for the critical dimensions from 130x170 nm2 to 130x670 nm2 over 70x70 mm2 (49 cm2) wafer working area. Next, we investigate JJ oxidation process (oxidation method, pressure and time) and its impact on a room temperature resistance reproducibility. Finally, we combine both shadow evaporation bias correction and oxidation best practices for 4-inch wafers improving room temperature resistance variation coefficient down to 6.0/5.2/4.1% for 0.025 {\mu}m2 JJ area and 4.0/3.4/2.3% for 0.090 {\mu}m2 JJ area for 49/25/16 cm2 wafer working area correspondingly. The proposed model and oxidation method can be useful for robust wafer-scale superconducting quantum processors fabrication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate strategies for the efficient deterministic creation of trains of time-bin entangled photons using an individual quantum emitter described by a $\Lambda$-type electronic system. We explicitly demonstrate generation of high-quality linear cluster states of substantial length in our full microscopic numerical simulations. The underlying scheme is based on the manipulation of ground state coherences through precise optical driving. One important finding is that the most easily accessible quality metrics, the achievable rotation fidelities, fall short in assessing the actual quantum correlations of the emitted photons in the face of losses. To address this, we explicitly calculate stabilizer generator expectation values as a superior gauge for the quantum properties of the many-photon state. Our results illustrate that with controlled minimization of losses and realistic system parameters for quantum-dot type systems, useful linear cluster states of significant lengths can be generated, showcasing promise of scalability for quantum information processing endeavors.</description>

Abstract: The rapid development of quantum science and technology is leading us into an era where quantum many-body systems can be comprehended through quantum simulations. Holographic duality, which states gravity and spacetime can emerge from strongly interacting systems, then offers a natural avenue for the experimental study of gravity physics without delving into experimentally infeasible high energies. A prominent example is the simulation of traversable wormholes through the wormhole teleportation protocol, attracting both theoretical and experimental attention. In this work, we develop the theoretical framework for computing the fidelity of wormhole teleportation in $N$-qubit systems with all-to-all interactions, quantified by mutual information and entanglement negativity. The main technique is the scramblon effective theory, which captures universal out-of-time-order correlations in generic chaotic systems. We clarify that strong couplings between the two systems are essential for simulating the probe limit of semi-classical traversable wormholes using strongly interacting systems with near-maximal chaos. However, the teleportation signal diminishes rapidly when reducing the system size $N$, requiring a large number of qubits to observe a sharp signature of emergent geometry by simulating the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This includes both the causal time-order of signals and the asymmetry of the teleportation signal for coupling with different signs. As a comparison, the teleportation signal increases when reducing $N$ in weakly interacting systems. We also analyze the fidelity of the generalized encoding scheme in fermionic string operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiplication of superpositions of numbers is a core operation in many quantum algorithms. The standard method for multiplication (both classical and quantum) has a runtime quadratic in the size of the inputs. Quantum circuits with asymptotically fewer gates have been developed, but generally exhibit large overheads, especially in the number of ancilla qubits. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for sub-quadratic-time quantum multiplication with zero ancilla qubits -- the only qubits involved are the input and output registers themselves. Our algorithm achieves an asymptotic gate count of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$; with practical choices of parameters, we expect scalings as low as $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.3})$. Used as a subroutine in Shor's algorithm, our technique immediately yields a factoring circuit with $\mathcal{O}(n^{2+\epsilon})$ gates and only $2n + \mathcal{O}(\log n)$ qubits; to our knowledge, this is by far the best qubit count of any factoring circuit with a sub-cubic number of gates. Used in Regev's recent factoring algorithm, the gate count is $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5+\epsilon})$. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithm has the potential to outperform previous proposals at problem sizes relevant in practice, including yielding the smallest circuits we know of for classically-verifiable quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are still challenging to solve linear systems of equations on real devices. This challenge arises from the need for deep circuits and numerous ancilla qubits. We introduce the quantum conjugate gradient (QCG) method using the quantum eigenvalue transformation (QET). The circuit depth of this algorithm depends on the square root of the coefficient matrix's condition number $\kappa$, representing a square root improvement compared to the previous quantum algorithms, while the total query complexity worsens. The number of ancilla qubits is constant, similar to other QET-based algorithms. Additionally, to implement the QCG method efficiently, we devise a QET-based technique that uses only the positive side of the polynomial (denoted by $P(x)$ for $x\in[0,1]$). We conduct numerical experiments by applying our algorithm to the one-dimensional Poisson equation and successfully solve it. Based on the numerical results, our algorithm significantly improves circuit depth, outperforming another QET-based algorithm by three to four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A quantum information theoretic analysis of reinforcement learning-assisted quantum architecture search</title>

Abstract: In the field of quantum computing, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a pivotal category of quantum solutions across a broad spectrum of applications. These algorithms demonstrate significant potential for realising quantum computational advantage. A fundamental aspect of VQAs involves formulating expressive and efficient quantum circuits (namely ansatz) and automating the search of such ansatz is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). RL-QAS involves optimising QAS using reinforcement learning techniques. This study investigates RL-QAS for crafting ansatzes tailored to the variational quantum state diagonalisation problem. Our investigation includes a comprehensive analysis of various dimensions, such as the entanglement thresholds of the resultant states, the impact of initial conditions on the performance of RL-agent, the phase change behaviour of correlation in concurrence bounds, and the discrete contributions of qubits in deducing eigenvalues through conditional entropy metrics. We leverage these insights to devise entanglement-guided admissible ansatz in QAS to diagonalise random quantum states using optimal resources. Furthermore, the methodologies presented herein offer a generalised framework for constructing reward functions within RL-QAS applicable to variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Counting statistics of ultra-broadband microwave photons</title>

Abstract: We report measurements of counting statistics, average and variance, of microwave photons of ill-defined frequency: bichromatic photons, i.e. photons involving two well separated frequencies, and "white", broadband photons. Our setup allows for the detection of single photonic modes of arbitrary waveform over the 1-10 GHz frequency range. The photon statistics is obtained by on-the-fly numerical calculation from the measured time-dependent voltage. After validating our procedure with thermal- and squeezed- radiation of such photons, we relate the detected statistics to the squeezing spectrum of an ac+dc biased tunnel junction. We observe an optimal squeezing of $\sim$1.5dB over a bandwidth $&gt;1$ GHz, better than 1dB over 3.5 GHz and still see squeezing over a bandwidth of $\sim6$ GHz around 6 GHz. We also show how the waveform of a bichromatic photon can be optimized for maximum squeezing.</description>

      <title>Mutually unbiased bases: polynomial optimization and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05698v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of $k$ orthonormal bases of $\mathbb C^d$ is called mutually unbiased if $|\langle e,f\rangle |^2 = 1/d$ whenever $e$ and $f$ are basis vectors in distinct bases. A natural question is for which pairs $(d,k)$ there exist~$k$ mutually unbiased bases in dimension $d$. The (well-known) upper bound $k \leq d+1$ is attained when~$d$ is a power of a prime. For all other dimensions it is an open problem whether the bound can be attained. Navascu\'es, Pironio, and Ac\'in showed how to reformulate the existence question in terms of the existence of a certain $C^*$-algebra. This naturally leads to a noncommutative polynomial optimization problem and an associated hierarchy of semidefinite programs. The problem has a symmetry coming from the wreath product of $S_d$ and $S_k$.
  We exploit this symmetry (analytically) to reduce the size of the semidefinite programs making them (numerically) tractable. A key step is a novel explicit decomposition of the $S_d \wr S_k$-module $\mathbb C^{([d]\times [k])^t}$ into irreducible modules. We present numerical results for small $d,k$ and low levels of the hierarchy. In particular, we obtain sum-of-squares proofs for the (well-known) fact that there do not exist $d+2$ mutually unbiased bases in dimensions~$d=2,3,4,5,6,7,8$. Moreover, our numerical results indicate that a sum-of-squares refutation, in the above-mentioned framework, of the existence of more than $3$ MUBs in dimension $6$ requires polynomials of total degree at least~$12$.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Dual-Atom-Interferometer Inertial Sensor with Continuous Cold Atomic Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a closed-loop light-pulse atom interferometer inertial sensor that can realize continuous decoupled measurements of acceleration and rotation rate. The sensor operates with double-loop atom interferometers, which share the same Raman light pulses in a spatially separated Mach-Zehnder configuration and use continuous cold atomic beams propagating in opposite directions from two 2D$^+$ magneto-optical trappings. Acceleration and the rotation rate are decoupled and simultaneously measured by the sum and difference of dual atom-interferometer signals, respectively. The sensitivities of inertial measurements are also increased to be approximately 1.86 times higher than that of a single atom interferometer. The acceleration phase shift is compensated in real time by phase-locking these interferometers via the Raman laser phases from the sum interferometer signal, and the gyroscope perfomance is improved. We achieve long-term stabilities of $6.1 \ \mu g$ and 840 nrad/s for the acceleration and the rotation rate, respectively, using a short interrogation time of 0.87ms (interference area $A=0.097$ mm$^2$). This work provides a building block for an atomic interferometer based inertial measurement unit for use in field applications that require a high data-rate and high stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent developments in the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), particularly on its rich interplay with topology. The review starts off with a pedagogical introduction on the modified bulk-boundary correspondence, the synergy and hybridization of NHSE and band topology in higher dimensions, as well as, the associated topology on the complex energy plane such as spectral winding topology and spectral graph topology. Following which, emerging topics are introduced such as non-Hermitian criticality, dynamical NHSE phenomena, and the manifestation of NHSE beyond the traditional linear non-interacting crystal lattices, particularly its interplay with quantum many-body interactions. Finally, we survey the recent demonstrations and experimental proposals of NHSE.</description>

      <title>Mimicking quantum self-propulsion creates a generic route to quantum active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic framework for describing quantum active matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that is of pure quantum origin. These quantum-active features are most clearly revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short time scales, that are intricately dependent on the geometry of the trapping potential.</description>

      <title>Beyond trace class -- Tensor products of Hilbert spaces and operator ideals in quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the meaning of the conjugate of a complex Hilbert space, including a related application of the theorem of Fr\'{e}chet-Riesz (by which an analysis of semilinear operators can be reduced to - linear - operator theory) to a revisit of applications of nuclear and absolutely $p$-summing operators in algebraic quantum field theory in the sense of Araki, Haag and Kastler ($p=2$) and more recently in the framework of general probabilistic spaces ($p=1$), we will outline that Banach operator ideals in the sense of Pietsch, or equivalently tensor products of Banach spaces in the sense of Grothendieck are even lurking in the foundations and philosophy of quantum physics and quantum information theory. In particular, we concentrate on their importance in algebraic quantum field theory. In doing so, we establish a canonical isometric isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces $H\otimes_2 (K \otimes_2 L)$ and $(H \otimes_2 K) \otimes_2 L$ (Theorem 3.8) and revisit the role of trace class operators.
  A few applications are specified, including the appropriateness of the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an implied Banach operator ideal representation of the tensor product of two complex Hilbert spaces $H \otimes_2 K$ (Proposition 3.4) and a purely linear algebraic description of the quantum teleportation process (Example 3.10).</description>

      <title>Edge theory of non-Hermitian skin modes in higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an effective edge theory to characterize non-Hermitian edge-skin modes in higher dimensions. We begin by proposing a bulk projection criterion to straightforwardly identify the localized edges of skin modes. Through an exact mapping, we show that the edge-skin mode shares the same bulk-boundary correspondence and localization characteristics as the zero-energy edge states in a Hermitian semimetal under open-boundary conditions, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian edge-skin effect and Hermitian semimetals. Another key finding is the introduction of ``skewness,'' a term we proposed to describe the characteristic decay direction of skin mode from the localized edge into the bulk. Remarkably, we demonstrate that skewness is an intrinsic quantity of the skin mode and can be analytically determined using the corresponding cylinder-geometry bulk Hamiltonian, without requiring any boundary details. Furthermore, we reveal that in the edge-skin effect, the spectrum exhibits anomalous spectral sensitivity to weak local disturbances, a feature that crucially distinguishes it from the corner-skin effect.</description>

Abstract: I discuss the thermodynamics-based derivation of the formula for the entanglement entropy of a system of gluons. The derivation is based on an approach where saturation and the Unruh effect were used to obtain and discuss the entropy of gluons. The formula agrees, in the high-energy limit, up to a numerical factor, with more recent results, where arguments based on the density matrix and bipartition of the proton were used to obtain the formula. I also discuss the relation of entropy as obtained in BFKL in DLL approximation and with the application of the BK equation.</description>

      <title>Elementary Quantum Recursion Schemes That Capture Quantum Polylogarithmic Time Computability of Quantum Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has been studied over the past four decades based on two computational models of quantum circuits and quantum Turing machines. To capture quantum polynomial-time computability, a new recursion-theoretic approach was taken lately by Yamakami [J. Symb. Logic 80, pp. 1546--1587, 2020] by way of recursion schematic definitions, which constitute six initial quantum functions and three construction schemes of composition, branching, and multi-qubit quantum recursion. By taking a similar approach, we look into quantum polylogarithmic-time computability and further explore the expressing power of elementary schemes designed for such quantum computation. In particular, we introduce an elementary form of the quantum recursion, called the fast quantum recursion and formulate EQS (elementary quantum schemes) of "elementary" quantum functions. This class EQS captures exactly quantum polylogarithmic-time computability, represented by BQPOLYLOGTIME. We also demonstrate the separation of BQPOLYLOGTIME from NLOGTIME and PPOLYLOGTIME. As a natural extension of EQS, we further consider an algorithmic procedural scheme that implements the well-known divide-and-conquer strategy. This divide-and-conquer scheme helps compute the parity function but the scheme cannot be realized within our system EQS.</description>

      <title>Cutoff brane vs the Karch-Randall brane: the fluctuating case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, certain holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$ is proposed to capture the main features of the AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ correspondence \cite{Basu:2022crn,Basu:2023wmv}. In this paper, by adapting the Weyl transformation, we simulate a generalized AdS/BCFT set-up where the fluctuation of the Karch-Randall (KR) brane is considered. In the gravity dual of the Weyl transformed CFT, the so-called cutoff brane induced by the Weyl transformation plays the same role as the KR brane. Unlike the non-fluctuating configuration, in the $2d$ effective theory the additional twist operator is inserted at a different place, compared with the one inserted on the brane. Though this is well-understood in the Weyl transformed CFT set-up, it is confusing in the AdS/BCFT set-up where the effective theory is supposed to locate on the brane. This confusion indicates that the KR brane may be emergent from the boundary CFT$_2$ via the Weyl transformations.
  We also calculate the balanced partial entanglement (BPE) in the fluctuating brane configurations and find it coincide with the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS). This is a non-trivial test for the correspondence between the BPE and the EWCS, and a non-trivial consistency check for the Weyl transformed CFT set-up.</description>

      <title>Relativistic single-electron wavepacket in quantum electromagnetic fields: Quantum coherence, correlations, and the Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional formulation of QED since the 50s works very well for stationary states and for scattering problems, but with newly arisen challenges from the 80s on, where real time evolution of particles in a nonequilibrium setting are required, and quantum features such as coherence, dissipation, correlation and entanglement in a system interacting with its quantum field environment are sought after, new ways to formulate QED suitable for these purposes beckon. In this paper we present a linearized effective theory using a Gaussian wavepacket description of a charged relativistic particle coupled to quantum electromagnetic fields to study the interplay between single electrons and quantum fields in free space, at a scale well below the Schwinger limit. The proper values of the regulators in our effective theory are determined from the data of individual experiments, and will be time-dependent in the laboratory frame if the single electrons are accelerated. Using this new theoretical tool, we address the issues of decoherence of flying electrons in free space and the impact of Unruh effect on the electrons. Our result suggests that vacuum fluctuations may be a major source of blurring the interference pattern in electron microscopes. For a single electron accelerated in a uniform electric field, we identify the Unruh effect in the two-point correlators of the deviations from the electron's classical trajectory. From our calculations we also bring out some subtleties, involving the bosonic versus fermionic spectral functions.</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction as an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner. Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$, thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems, drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way, the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater level of control, using atomtronics platforms.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Calculations of Nonlinear Susceptibility and Multi-Phonon Mixing Processes in a 2DEG-Piezoelectric Heterostructure</title>

Abstract: Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Observation of a time crystal comb in a driven-dissipative system with Rydberg gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystals, as temporal analogs of space crystals, manifest as stable and periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum system, many-body interaction subjected to dissipation allows one to develop the time crystalline order in an unprecedented way, as refer to dissipative time crystal. Here we report the observation of a time crystal comb in the continuously driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gas, in which continuous time crystal and sub-harmonics of limit cycles as well as the high-order harmonic oscillation phases are observed in the same system by manipulating the Rydberg excitation. Our work provides new ways to explore the nonequilibrium phases of matter in open systems. Such time crystals with persistent oscillation rooted in emergent quantum correlations, may emerge as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for instance, continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Topology-induced symmetry breaking: a demonstration in antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip</title>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is broken in the excited eigenstates due to the nontrivial boundary condition. As a demonstration, we study magnon excitations on a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even under a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and without considering curvature effects, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality and form two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons typically seen in antiferromagnets. One branch supports standing-wave formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral shift incurred by the boundary condition. Our findings showcase the significant influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Bose-Hubbard model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>
