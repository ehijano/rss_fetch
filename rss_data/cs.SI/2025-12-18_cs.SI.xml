      <title>Effectively Detecting and Responding to Online Harassment with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online harassment has been a persistent issue in the online space. Predominantly, research focused on online harassment in public social media platforms, while less is placed on private messaging platforms. To address online harassment on one private messaging platform, Instagram, we leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we recruited human labelers to identify online harassment in an Instagram messages dataset. Using the previous conversation as context, we utilize an LLM pipeline to conduct large-scale labeling on Instagram messages and evaluate its performance against human labels. Then, we use LLM to generate and evaluate simulated responses to online harassment messages. We find that the LLM labeling pipeline is capable of identifying online harassment in private messages. By comparing human responses and simulated responses, we also demonstrate that our simulated responses are superior in helpfulness compared to original human responses.</description>

      <title>SEMO: A Socio-Evolutionary Adaptive Optimization Framework for Dynamic Social Network Tie Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel computational framework that models human social decision-making under uncertainty as an integrated Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) and Markov Decision Process (MDP) optimization problem, in which agents adaptively balance the exploration of new social ties and the exploitation of existing relationships to maximize a socio-evolutionary fitness. The framework combines reinforcement learning, Bayesian belief updating, and agent-based simulation on a dynamic social graph, allowing each agent to use bandit-based Upper-Confidence-Bound (UCB) strategies for tie formation within an MDP of long-term social planning. We define a formal socio-evolutionary fitness function that captures both individual payoffs (e.g. shared information or support) and network-level benefits, and we derive update rules incorporating cognitive constraints and bounded rationality. Our Social-UCB algorithm, presented in full pseudocode, provably yields logarithmic regret and ensures stable exploitation via UCB-style bounds. In simulation experiments, Social-UCB consistently achieves higher cumulative social fitness and more efficient network connectivity than baseline heuristics. We include detailed descriptions of envisioned figures and tables (e.g. network evolution plots, model comparisons) to illustrate key phenomena. This integrated model bridges gaps in the literature by unifying exploration-exploitation dynamics, network evolution, and social learning, offering a rigorous new tool for studying adaptive human social behavior.</description>

      <title>Tourists Profiling by Interest Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent digital revolution, analyzing of tourists' behaviors and research fields associated with it have changed profoundly. It is now easier to examine behaviors of tourists using digital traces they leave during their travels. The studies conducted on diverse aspects of tourism focus on quantitative aspects of digital traces to reach its conclusions. In this paper, we suggest a study focused on both qualitative and quantitative aspect of digital traces to understand the dynamics governing tourist behavior, especially those concerning attractions networks.</description>

      <title>The Graph-Embedded Hazard Model (GEHM): Stochastic Network Survival Dynamics on Economic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a nonlinear evolution framework for modelling survival dynamics on weighted economic networks by coupling a graph-based $p$-Laplacian diffusion operator with a stochastic structural drift. The resulting finite-dimensional PDE--SDE system captures how node-level survival reacts to nonlinear diffusion pressures while an aggregate complexity factor evolves according to an It\^o{} process. Using accretive operator theory, nonlinear semigroup methods, and stochastic analysis, we establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions, derive topology-dependent energy dissipation inequalities, and characterise the stability threshold separating dissipative, critical, amplifying, and explosive regimes. Numerical experiments on Barab\'asi--Albert networks confirm that hub dominance magnifies nonlinear gradients and compresses stability margins, producing heavy-tailed survival distributions and occasional explosive behaviour.</description>

      <title>Boundaries in Hypernetwork Theory: Structure and Scope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundaries in Hypernetwork Theory (HT) are non-structural tags that restrict visibility without altering the underlying hypernetwork. They attach to hypersimplices as annotations and participate in no identity, typing, or alpha/beta semantics. Projection over a boundary, B(H, b) = pi_b(H), is filtering only: it selects exactly those hypersimplices carrying b and preserves all axioms of the structural kernel. The backcloth remains immutable, and no new structure is created, removed, or inferred.
  This paper formalises boundaries as a simple and conservative scoping mechanism. It clarifies their syntax, their interaction with projection, and their use in producing identity-preserving subsystem views that support modular modelling and overlapping perspectives. The account also makes explicit why conservative scoping matters: boundaries provide reproducible view extraction, stable subsystem isolation, and safe model exploration without altering the global structure.
  Scoped operator application is defined as ordinary structural-kernel composition applied to projected views, ensuring that view-level reasoning remains local and does not modify the global hypernetwork. This establishes a disciplined separation between immutable structure and scoped analysis while retaining full compatibility with the structural kernel.
  The paper includes a worked example demonstrating how boundaries yield coherent, identity-preserving subsystem views and how scoped reasoning supports refinement within these views. The result is a precise and minimal account of boundaries that complements - but does not extend - the structural kernel and completes the scoping mechanism required for practical multilevel modelling with HT.</description>

      <title>Promoting Fairness in Information Access within Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of online social networks has facilitated fast and wide spread of information. However, some users, especially members of minority groups, may be less likely to receive information spreading on the network, due to their disadvantaged network position. We study the optimization problem of adding new connections to a network to enhance fairness in information access among different demographic groups.
  We provide a concrete formulation of this problem where information access is measured in terms of resistance distance, {offering a new perspective that emphasizes global network structure and multi-path connectivity.} The problem is shown to be NP-hard. We propose a simple greedy algorithm which turns out to output accurate solutions, but its run time is cubic, which makes it undesirable for large networks. As our main technical contribution, we reduce its time complexity to linear, leveraging several novel approximation techniques. In addition to our theoretical findings, we also conduct an extensive set of experiments using both real-world and synthetic datasets. We demonstrate that our linear-time algorithm can produce accurate solutions for networks with millions of nodes.</description>

      <title>SoMe: A Realistic Benchmark for LLM-based Social Media Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities and gained increasing popularity on social media platforms. While LLM agents are reshaping the ecology of social media, there exists a current gap in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of their ability to comprehend media content, understand user behaviors, and make intricate decisions. To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data. SoMe comprises a diverse collection of 8 social media agent tasks, 9,164,284 posts, 6,591 user profiles, and 25,686 reports from various social media platforms and external websites, with 17,869 meticulously annotated task queries. Compared with the existing datasets and benchmarks for social media tasks, SoMe is the first to provide a versatile and realistic platform for LLM-based social media agents to handle diverse social media tasks. By extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we provide the first overview insight into the performance of mainstream agentic LLMs in realistic social media environments and identify several limitations. Our evaluation reveals that both the current closed-source and open-source LLMs cannot handle social media agent tasks satisfactorily. SoMe provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future social media agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LivXue/SoMe</description>

      <title>Compute the edge p-Laplacian centrality for air traffic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem that we would like to solve in this paper is to compute the edge p-Laplacian centrality for the air traffic network. In this problem, instead of computing the edge p-Laplacian centrality directly which is the very hard problem, we convert the air traffic network to the line graph. Finally, we will compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph which is equivalent to the edge p-Laplacian of the air traffic network. In this paper, the novel un-normalized graph (p-) Laplacian based ranking method will be developed based on the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian operator definitions such as the curvature operator of graph (i.e. the un-normalized graph 1-Laplacian operator) and will be used to compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph. The results from the experiments show that the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian ranking methods can be implemented successfully.</description>

      <title>Cyberswarm: a novel swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by cyber community dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems face challenges in dynamically adapting to evolving user preferences and interactions within complex social networks. Traditional approaches often fail to account for the intricate interactions within cyber-social systems and lack the flexibility to generalize across diverse domains, highlighting the need for more adaptive and versatile solutions. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose swarm intelligence algorithm for recommendation systems, designed to adapt seamlessly to varying applications. It was inspired by social psychology principles. The framework models user preferences and community influences within a dynamic hypergraph structure. It leverages centrality-based feature extraction and Node2Vec embeddings. Preference evolution is guided by message-passing mechanisms and hierarchical graph modeling, enabling real-time adaptation to changing behaviors. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the algorithm's superior performance in various recommendation tasks, including social networks and content discovery. Key metrics such as Hit Rate (HR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) consistently outperformed baseline methods across multiple datasets. The model's adaptability to dynamic environments allowed for contextually relevant and precise recommendations. The proposed algorithm represents an advancement in recommendation systems by bridging individual preferences and community influences. Its general-purpose design enables applications in diverse domains, including social graphs, personalized learning, and medical graphs. This work highlights the potential of integrating swarm intelligence with network dynamics to address complex optimization challenges in recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Neighborhoods Mining: Homophily-Aware Neutral Contrastive Learning for Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, neighbor-based contrastive learning has been introduced to effectively exploit neighborhood information for clustering. However, these methods rely on the homophily assumption-that connected nodes share similar class labels and should therefore be close in feature space-which fails to account for the varying homophily levels in real-world graphs. As a result, applying contrastive learning to low-homophily graphs may lead to indistinguishable node representations due to unreliable neighborhood information, making it challenging to identify trustworthy neighborhoods with varying homophily levels in graph clustering. To tackle this, we introduce a novel neighborhood Neutral Contrastive Graph Clustering method, NeuCGC, that extends traditional contrastive learning by incorporating neutral pairs-node pairs treated as weighted positive pairs, rather than strictly positive or negative. These neutral pairs are dynamically adjusted based on the graph's homophily level, enabling a more flexible and robust learning process. Leveraging neutral pairs in contrastive learning, our method incorporates two key components: (1) an adaptive contrastive neighborhood distribution alignment that adjusts based on the homophily level of the given attribute graph, ensuring effective alignment of neighborhood distributions, and (2) a contrastive neighborhood node feature consistency learning mechanism that leverages reliable neighborhood information from high-confidence graphs to learn robust node representations, mitigating the adverse effects of varying homophily levels and effectively exploiting highly trustworthy neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, outperforming other state-of-the-art graph clustering methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/THPengL/NeuCGC.</description>

      <title>Model inference for ranking from pairwise comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking objects from noisy pairwise comparisons, for example, ranking tennis players from the outcomes of matches. We follow a standard approach to this problem and assume that each object has an unobserved strength and that the outcome of each comparison depends probabilistically on the strengths of the comparands. However, we do not assume to know a priori how skills affect outcomes. Instead, we present an efficient algorithm for simultaneously inferring both the unobserved strengths and the function that maps strengths to probabilities. Despite this problem being under-constrained, we present experimental evidence that the conclusions of our Bayesian approach are robust to different model specifications. We include several case studies to exemplify the method on real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>Reducing Recurrent Competitive Epidemics via Dynamic Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.13395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by scenarios of epidemic competition, as well as how social contagions spread at the level of individuals, this work considers the competition between two conflicting node states that spread over a social graph according to a generic diffusion process. For this setting, we introduce the Generalized Largest Reduction in Infectious Edges (gLRIE), which is a dynamic resource allocation strategy that favors the preferred state against the other. Our analysis assumes a generic continuous-time SIS-like (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) diffusion model that allows for: arbitrary node transition rate functions for nodes to change state, and competition between the healthy (positive) and infected (negative) states, which are both diffusive at the same time, yet mutually exclusive at each node. The strategy follows a minimum-risk-maximum-gain principle, and its features are particularly relevant for social contagion phenomena. In accordance with the LRIE strategy that we generalize, we show that in this context the gLRIE strategy remains a greedy solution for the minimization of the number of infected network nodes over time. Ultimately, simulations are employed to compare the proposed strategy with other existing alternatives, demonstrating that gLRIE exhibits superior performance across a spectrum of scenarios, including a realistic counter-contagion campaign in a small well-monitored community.</description>

      <title>Leader-driven or Leaderless: How Participation Structure Sustains Engagement and Shapes Narratives in Online Hate Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremist communities increasingly rely on social media to sustain and amplify divisive discourse. However, the relationship between their internal participation structures, audience engagement, and narrative expression remains underexplored. This study analyzes ten years of Facebook activity by hate groups related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, focusing on anti-Semitic and Islamophobic ideologies. Consistent with prior work, we find that higher participation centralization in online hate groups is associated with greater user engagement across hate ideologies, suggesting the role of key actors in sustaining group activity over time. Conversely, our narrative frame detection models - based on an eight-frame extremist taxonomy (e.g., dehumanization, violence justification) - reveal a clear contrast across hate ideologies, offering new insight into how discursive strategies vary despite similar structural dynamics. Analysis of the inter-group network indicates that, although centralization and homophily are not clearly linked, ideological distinctions emerge: Islamophobic groups cluster tightly, whereas anti-Semitic groups remain more evenly connected. Overall, these findings clarify how participation structure may shape the dissemination pattern and resonance of extremist narratives online and provide a foundation for tailored strategies to disrupt or mitigate online extremist discourse.</description>
