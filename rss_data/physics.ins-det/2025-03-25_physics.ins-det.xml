      <title>Deep non-invasive cerebral blood flow sensing using diffuse correlation spectroscopy and ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is a crucial indicator of brain function, and its continuous monitoring is critical for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a non-invasive diffuse optical technique to investigate deep tissue microvascular dynamics. However, traditional DCS systems face challenges in real-time applications due to reliance on correlation boards or software autocorrelators for signal acquisition, which limits their practical use. Furthermore, most existing DCS measurements are confined to a source-detector separation, \rho = 20 - 30 mm, with a maximum \rho = 40 mm, potentially reducing cerebral hemodynamics assessment accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we utilized a fully in-house-built 512 x 512 single-photon avalanche diode array (SPAD) called ATLAS, featuring innovative on-chip autocorrelators. The ATLAS-DCS system was evaluated against a commercial correlator board DCS system for liquid phantoms and cuff occlusion studies. Also, we successfully monitored pulsatile blood flow at \rho of 50 mm with a high sampling rate of up to 56.3 Hz in a human forehead in vivo. Our system also demonstrated high fidelity in detecting human pulse and identifying behaviour-induced physiological variations from the subject's prefrontal cortex during video gaming. We show that the ATLAS-DCS system outperforms the commonly used APD-based DCS system, achieving more than 571x SNR improvement in a milk-phantom at \rho of 20 mm. This DCS on-chip design paves the way for high-speed biological signal measurement in real-time applications by significantly enhancing detection sensitivity and speed.</description>

      <title>Reporting on pTP sublimation during evaporation deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noble liquid detectors rely on wavelength shifter materials, such as p-terphenyl (pTP) and Tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB), which are widely used in neutrino and dark matter experiments. Given their importance, a thorough understanding and characterization of these compounds are essential for optimizing experimental techniques and enhancing detector performance. In this study, we report a novel phenomenon in which commonly used wavelength shifters undergo spontaneous sublimation under high vacuum conditions. We quantify the sublimation rates of pTP and TPB as a function of pressure and temperature, assessing their impact on material growth and physical properties. Additionally, we investigate how variations in film thickness and growth rate influence the sublimation process. These findings provide critical insights into improving the handling and preparation of wavelength shifters during the fabrication of light detectors for these experiments, ensuring their stability and performance in low-background photodetection systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the intrinsic sensitivity for a single-ended accelerometer without the influence of the mounting condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration technique for accelerometers has been internationally developed for up to 20 kHz to ensure the reliability of vibration measurement. However, it has been established that the calibrated sensitivity changes at over 10 kHz depending on the mounting conditions, and this makes it difficult to accurately measure the characteristics of accelerometers and degrades the accuracy of high-frequency vibration measurements. Thus, in this study, we developed a reversed-calibration method for measuring the intrinsic sensitivity of an accelerometer without the influence of the mounting conditions. Through demonstration experiment, the intrinsic resonance structure of the accelerometer at approximately 45.8 kHz was adequately determined. Furthermore, the result was independently confirmed by fitting the conventional adapter-calibration results up to 100 kHz with four different materials based on the dynamic three-body model. Concurrently, the material dependency observed during adapter calibration was quantitatively analyzed, after which its relationship with the Young's modulus was extracted. Overall, these results deepen our understanding of the performance of the accelerometer at above 10 kHz, which is essential in vibration metrology and accelerometer development.</description>

      <title>The On-Board Computer of the AcubeSAT Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AcubeSAT is an open-source CubeSat mission aiming to explore the effects of microgravity and radiation on eukaryotic cells using a compact microfluidic lab-on-a-chip platform. It is developed by SpaceDot, a volunteer, interdisciplinary student team at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and supported by the "Fly Your Satellite! 3" program of the European Space Agency (ESA) Education Office.
  The nanosatellite features an in-house designed on-board computer subsystem responsible for telecommand execution, telemetry fetching, onboard time synchronization, in-orbit patching, and fault recovery. The subsystem is designed on one PC/104 standard compatible Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that hosts the On-board Computer (OBC) on the one side and the Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) on the other, and it is compatible with the LibreCube standard. The hosted subsystems are functionally isolated and feature an ARM Cortex-M7, radiation-tolerant microcontroller each.
  Before sending anything to space thorough testing is required and specifically the on-board computer board underwent vibration and thermal cycling tests to ensure nominal operation in all conditions.
  This paper aims to elucidate the decision-making process, design iterations, and development stages of the custom board and accompanying in-house software. Insights garnered from the initial partially successful environmental test campaign at the ESA CubeSat Support Facility will be shared, along with the ensuing preparations, results, and lessons learned from subsequent testing endeavors in April 2024. Furthermore, the current developmental status will be discussed alongside future electromagnetic compatibility testing, integration plan on a FlatSat, and prospects for the open-source design as a cost-effective, and modular solution that can be tailored with little effort for upcoming missions.</description>

      <title>Design, Development and Testing of a Conformal 60 GHz Active Repeater for High Energy Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wireless Allowing Data and Power Transmission (WADAPT) proposal was formed to study the feasibility of wireless technologies in HEP experiments. A strong motivation for using wireless data transmission at the ATLAS detector is the absence of wires and connectors to reduce the passive material. However, the tracking layers are almost hermetic, acting as a Faraday cage, that doesn't allow propagation between the layers. For radial readout of the detector data through the layers, we have developed an active repeater board, which is passed through a 2-3 mm wide slit between the modules on the tracking layers. The repeater is also advantageous in building topological radial networks for neuromorphic tracking. The active repeater board consists of an RX antenna, an amplifier, and a TX antenna, and is tested on a mockup in a way that the RX antenna will be on the inner side of a module, and the TX antenna will be on the outer side of the same module, as the 10-mil thick conformal board is passed through the small slit. Transmission through the tracking layers using the repeater has been demonstrated with two horn antennas, a signal generator, and a spectrum analyzer. For 20 cm distance between the horn antenna and the repeater board, a receive level of -19.5 dBm was achieved. In comparison, with the same setup but with the amplifier turned off, the receive level was ~-46 dBm. The results show a significant milestone towards the implementation of 60 GHz links for detector data readout.</description>

      <title>Development of portable cosmic-ray muon detector array for muography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the multidisciplinary applications of cosmic-ray muons expand to large-scale and wide-area scenarios, the construction of cosmic-ray muon detector arrays has become a key solution to overcome the hardware limitations of individual detector. For muography, the array-based detector design enables fast-scanning of large target objects, allowing for rapid identification of density variation regions, which can improve the efficiency of tomography. This paper integrates scintillator detector technology with Internet of things (IoT) technology, proposing a novel array networking model for nationwide deployment. The model enables long-distance data collection and distribution, laying the foundation for future multidisciplinary applications such as muography and other fields.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Calibration Procedures for the Silicon Photomultiplier Readout of the Cosmic Ray Veto Detector for the Mu2e Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic ray veto detector for the Mu2e experiment consists of scintillation bars embedded with wavelength-shifting fibers and read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this manuscript the calibration procedures of the SiPMs are described including corrections for the temperature dependence of their light yield. These corrections are needed as the SiPMs are not kept at a constant temperature due to the complexity and cost of implementing a cooling system on such a large detector. Rather, it was decided to monitor the temperature to allow the appropriate corrections to be made. The SiPM temperature dependence has been measured in a dedicated experiment and the calibration procedures were validated with data from production detectors awaiting installation at Fermilab.</description>

      <title>Diving deep into the Milky Way using Anti-Reflection Coatings for Astronomical CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report two anti-reflection (AR) coatings that give better quantum efficiency (QE) than the existing AR coating on the Gaia astrometric field (AF) CCDs. Light being the core of optical astronomy is extremely important for such missions, therefore, the QE of the devices that are used to capture it should be substantially high. To reduce the losses due to the reflection of light from the surface of the CCDs, AR coatings can be applied. Currently, the main component of the Gaia satellite, the AF CCDs use hafnium dioxide (HfO2) AR coating. In this paper, the ATLAS module of the SILVACO software has been employed for simulating and studying the AF CCD pixel structure and several AR coatings. Our findings evidently suggest that zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) will prove to be better AR coatings for broadband astronomical CCDs in the future and will open new avenues for understanding the evolution of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection Based on Reinforcement Learning and Hazard State Classification for Magnetic Adhesion Wall-Climbing Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic adhesion tracked wall-climbing robots face potential risks of overturning during high-altitude operations, making their stability crucial for ensuring safety. This study presents a dynamic feature selection method based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning, combined with typical machine learning models, aimed at improving the classification accuracy of hazardous states under complex operating conditions. Firstly, this work innovatively employs a fiber rod-based MEMS attitude sensor to collect vibration data from the robot and extract high-dimensional feature vectors in both time and frequency domains. Then, a reinforcement learning model is used to dynamically select the optimal feature subset, reducing feature redundancy and enhancing classification accuracy. Finally, a CNN-LSTM deep learning model is employed for classification and recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the robot's ability to assess hazardous states across various operational scenarios, providing reliable technical support for robotic safety monitoring.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly-polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. We verify our predicted complementary response in rubidium vapour cell experiments and through density matrix calculations. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic polarimetry for quantum metrological electric field characterization.</description>

      <title>Fourier State Tomography of Polarization-Encoded Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a central technique for the characterization and verification of quantum systems. Standard tomography is widely used for low-dimensional systems, but for larger systems, it becomes impractical due to the exponential scaling of experimental complexity with the number of qubits. Here, we present an experimental realization of Fourier-transform quantum state tomography for polarization-encoded photonic states. We validate the technique using weak coherent states and entangled photon pairs generated by a quantum dot and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in the telecom wavelength. The reconstructed density matrices show excellent agreement with those obtained through conventional projective tomography, with calculated metrics such as fidelity and concurrence matching within error bars, confirming the reliability and accuracy of the technique. Fourier state tomography employs only a single rotating waveplate per qubit, thereby avoiding repeated adjustments across multiple waveplates and ensuring that the number of physical measurement settings scales linearly with the number of qubits, despite the exponential growth of the underlying state space. This reduction in optical configurations simplifies experimental overhead, making Fourier state tomography a practical alternative for multi-qubit characterization.</description>

      <title>Simulation Based Design Enhancement of Multilayer GaN and InN/GaN/AlN MSM Photodetectors for Ultraviolet Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A GaN-based photodetector structure was optimized and modeled in the mesa region, incorporating a nickel-gold contact layer on a sapphire substrate to enhance ultraviolet (UV) detection. To further improve performance, an alternative design integrating thin InN (top) and AlN (buffer) layers was proposed. These additional layers were introduced to enhance carrier transport and optical absorption within the device. Following mesa thickness simulations, a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate was tested to assess its impact on detector performance. Each simulation phase aimed to optimize current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, photoabsorption rate, and spectral responsivity, ensuring the design approached realistic operational conditions. A new Sapphire/GaN(p-type)/GaN/GaN(n-type)/Ni/Au detector was designed based on the optimized buffer layer thicknesses in the mesa region, using parameters from the Sapphire/AlN/GaN/InN/Ni/Au structure. This new detector was further optimized as a function of doping concentration. Additionally, the contact electrode finger thickness and inter-finger spacing were geometrically refined to maximize performance. This comprehensive simulation study demonstrates a significant enhancement in photodetector response through structural and doping optimizations. Normalized I-V characteristics revealed a photocurrent increase of 1.16-fold to 1.38-fold at each optimization stage. Similarly, mesa region thickness optimizations improved the photoabsorption rate from 1.97e24 1/s . cm^3 to 2.18e24 1/s . cm^3. Furthermore, the spectral responsivity in the UV region increased from 0.28e-7 A to 0.47e-7 A at 367 nm.These results show significant improvements in the structural and electrical performance of GaN-based photodetectors, providing a promising way to develop high-efficiency UV detection devices.</description>

Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures</title>

Abstract: We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Clear skies ahead: characterizing atmospheric gravity gradient noise for vertical atom interferometers</title>

Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from three prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Absolute Photon Detection Efficiency of the DUNE Far Detector Vertical Drift X-ARAPUCAs</title>

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline (1300 km) neutrino experiment hosted at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). It aims to measure neutrino mass ordering and CP violation through neutrino oscillations from a characterized muon neutrino beam. DUNE will deploy four Liquid-Argon Time-Projection-Chamber (LArTPC) detectors with a total mass of approximately 70 kT. The reconstruction of particle interactions, both from the beam and external neutrino sources is achieved by collecting two distinct interaction signals: ionization electrons with the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and scintillation photons (127 nm) with the Photon Detection System (PDS). Regarding the latter, to fulfil the physics requirements of the experiment, a uniform and efficient collection of the argon scintillation light across the 62 m x 15 m x 14 m detector volume is required to achieve an average detected light yield of at least 20 PE/MeV. For the case of DUNE's far detector module with vertical drift direction (FD-VD), the system relies on 672 X-ARAPUCA (XA) tiles, which trap photons inside its highly reflective box by shifting VUV light to visible wavelengths. An intensive R&amp;D campaign, involving multiple international institutions, has optimized the design and component selection for the next-generation PDS modules, which have been tested in liquid argon using a dedicated cryogenic setup developed at CIEMAT to evaluate their photon detection efficiency (PDE). Several configurations have been chosen to evaluate the possible design improvements in terms of different light-trapping strategies and reflectiveness.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pre-train the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set, and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode (FCC-ee). We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>
