      <title>The Persistent Effects of Peru's Mining MITA: Double Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the long-term economic impact of the colonial Mita system in Peru, building on Melissa Dell's foundational work on the enduring effects of forced labor institutions. The Mita, imposed by the Spanish colonial authorities from 1573 to 1812, required indigenous communities within a designated boundary to supply labor to mines, primarily near Potosi. Dell's original regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, leveraging the Mita boundary to estimate the Mita's legacy on modern economic outcomes, indicates that regions subjected to the Mita exhibit lower household consumption levels and higher rates of child stunting. In this paper, I replicate Dell's results and extend this analysis. I apply Double Machine Learning (DML) methods--the Partially Linear Regression (PLR) model and the Interactive Regression Model (IRM)--to further investigate the Mita's effects. DML allows for the inclusion of high-dimensional covariates and enables more flexible, non-linear modeling of treatment effects, potentially capturing complex relationships that a polynomial-based approach may overlook. While the PLR model provides some additional flexibility, the IRM model allows for fully heterogeneous treatment effects, offering a nuanced perspective on the Mita's impact across regions and district characteristics. My findings suggest that the Mita's economic legacy is more substantial and spatially heterogeneous than originally estimated. The IRM results reveal that proximity to Potosi and other district-specific factors intensify the Mita's adverse impact, suggesting a deeper persistence of regional economic inequality. These findings underscore that machine learning addresses the realistic non-linearity present in complex, real-world systems. By modeling hypothetical counterfactuals more accurately, DML enhances my ability to estimate the true causal impact of historical interventions.</description>

      <title>Single-Index Quantile Factor Model with Observed Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a characteristics-augmented quantile factor (QCF) model, where unknown factor loading functions are linked to a large set of observed individual-level (e.g., bond- or stock-specific) covariates via a single-index projection. The single-index specification offers a parsimonious, interpretable, and statistically efficient way to nonparametrically characterize the time-varying loadings, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality in flexible nonparametric models. Using a three-step sieve estimation procedure, the QCF model demonstrates high in-sample and out-of-sample accuracy in simulations. We establish asymptotic properties for estimators of the latent factor, loading functions, and index parameters. In an empirical study, we analyze the dynamic distributional structure of U.S. corporate bond returns from 2003 to 2020. Our method outperforms the benchmark quantile Fama-French five-factor model and quantile latent factor model, particularly in the tails ($\tau=0.05, 0.95$). The model reveals state-dependent risk exposures driven by characteristics such as bond and equity volatility, coupon, and spread. Finally, we provide economic interpretations of the latent factors.</description>

      <title>Randomization Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00202v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop randomization-based tests for heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of network interference. Leveraging the exposure mapping framework, we study a broad class of null hypotheses that represent various forms of constant treatment effects in networked populations. These null hypotheses, unlike the classical Fisher sharp null, are not sharp due to unknown parameters and multiple potential outcomes. Existing conditional randomization procedures either fail to control size or suffer from low statistical power in this setting. We propose a testing procedure that constructs a data-dependent focal assignment set and permits variation in focal units across focal assignments. These features complicate both estimation and inference, necessitating new technical developments. We establish the asymptotic validity of the proposed procedure under general conditions on the test statistic and characterize the asymptotic size distortion in terms of observable quantities. The procedure is applied to experimental network data and evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity, Uncertainty and Learning: Semiparametric Identification and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide identification results for a broad class of learning models in which continuous outcomes depend on three types of unobservables: known heterogeneity, initially unknown heterogeneity that may be revealed over time, and transitory uncertainty. We consider a common environment where the researcher only has access to a short panel on choices and realized outcomes. We establish identification of the outcome equation parameters and the distribution of the unobservables, under the standard assumption that unknown heterogeneity and uncertainty are normally distributed. We also show that, absent known heterogeneity, the model is identified without making any distributional assumption. We then derive the asymptotic properties of a sieve MLE estimator for the model parameters, and devise a tractable profile likelihood-based estimation procedure. Our estimator exhibits good finite-sample properties. Finally, we illustrate our approach with an application to ability learning in the context of occupational choice. Our results point to substantial ability learning based on realized wages.</description>
