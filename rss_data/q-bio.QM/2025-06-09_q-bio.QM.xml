      <title>Connectome brain fingerprinting: terminology, measures, and target properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing one person from another (what biometricians call recognition) is extremely relevant for different aspects of life. Traditional biometric modalities (fingerprint, face, iris, voice) rely on unique, stable features that reliably differentiate individuals. Recently, the term fingerprinting has gained popularity in neuroscience, with a growing number of studies adopting the term to describe various brain based metrics derived from different techniques. However, we think there is a mismatch between its widely accepted meaning in the biometric community and some brain based metrics. Many of these measures do not satisfy the strict definition of a biometric fingerprint that is, a stable trait that uniquely identifies an individual. In this study we discuss some issues that may generate confusion in this context and suggest how to treat the question in the future. In particular, we review how fingerprint is currently used in the neuroscience literature, highlight mismatches with the biometric community definition, and offer clear guidelines for distinguishing genuine biometric fingerprints from exploratory similarity metrics. By clarifying terminology and criteria, we aim to align practices and facilitate communication across fields.</description>

      <title>Cancer model with moving extinction threshold reproduces real cancer data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple dynamic model of cancer development that captures carcinogenesis and subsequent cancer progression. A central idea of the model is to include the immune system as an extinction threshold, similar to the strong Allee effect in population biology. We first identify the limitations of commonly used Allee effect models in reproducing typical cancer progression. We then address these limitations by deriving a new model that incorporates: (i) random mutations of stem cells at a rate that increases with age and (ii) immune response whose strength may also vary over time.
  Our model accurately reproduces a wide range of real-world cancer data: the typical age-specific cumulative risk of most human cancers, the progression of breast cancer in mice, and the unusual age-specific cumulative risk of breast cancer in women. In the last case, we use a moving extinction threshold to reflect the different immune response at different phases of the menstrual cycle and menopausal treatment. This provides new insights into the effects of hormone replacement therapy and menstrual cycle length. This moving threshold approach can be applied to a variety of other cancer scenarios where the immune response or other important factors may vary over time.</description>

      <title>Insights into the role of dynamical features in protein complex formation: the case of SARS-CoV-2 spike binding with ACE2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functionality of protein-protein complexes is closely tied to the strength of their interactions, making the evaluation of binding affinity a central focus in structural biology. However, the molecular determinants underlying binding affinity are still not fully understood. In particular, the entropic contributions, especially those arising from conformational dynamics, remain poorly characterized. In this study, we explore the relationship between protein motion and binding stability and its role in protein function. To gain deeper insight into how protein complexes modulate their stability, we investigated a model system with a well-characterized and fast evolutionary history: a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants bound to the human ACE2 receptor, for which experimental binding affinity data are available. Through Molecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical differences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike protein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more stable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in their unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed after binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole driving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized by a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but could optimize other traits, such as antibody escape. These results suggest that to fully understand the strength of the binding between two proteins, the stability of the two isolated partners should be investigated.</description>

      <title>Functional Architecture of the Human Hypothalamus: Cortical Coupling and Subregional Organization Using 7-Tesla fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of the bodys metabolic state and behaviors related to survival. Despite its importance however, many questions exist regarding the intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the hypothalamus in humans, especially its relationship with the cortex. As a heterogeneous structure, it is possible that the hypothalamus is composed of different subregions, which have their own distinct relationships with the cortex. Previous work on functional connectivity in the human hypothalamus have either treated it as a unitary structure or relied on methodological approaches that are limited in modeling its intrinsic functional architecture. Here, we used resting state data from ultrahigh field 7 Tesla fMRI and a data driven analytical approach to identify functional subregions of the human hypothalamus. Our approach identified four functional hypothalamic subregions based on intrinsic functional connectivity, which in turn showed distinct patterns of functional connectivity with cortex. Overall, all hypothalamic subregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical Network 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and weaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of posterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic subregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to Cortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior hypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity. The findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in providing a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects its complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture.</description>

      <title>Bayesian variable selection in a Cox proportional hazards model with the "Sum of Single Effects" prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by genetic fine-mapping applications, we introduce a new approach to Bayesian variable selection regression (BVSR) for time-to-event (TTE) outcomes. This new approach is designed to deal with the specific challenges that arise in genetic fine-mapping, including: the presence of very strong correlations among the covariates, often exceeding 0.99; very large data sets containing potentially thousands of covariates and hundreds of thousands of samples. We accomplish this by extending the "Sum of Single Effects" (SuSiE) method to the Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model. We demonstrate the benefits of the new method, "CoxPH-SuSiE", over existing BVSR methods for TTE outcomes in simulated fine-mapping data sets. We also illustrate CoxPH-SuSiE on real data by fine-mapping asthma loci using data from UK Biobank. This fine-mapping identified 14 asthma risk SNPs in 8 asthma risk loci, among which 6 had strong evidence for being causal (posterior inclusion probability greater than 50%). Two of the 6 putatively causal variants are known to be pathogenic, and others lie within a genomic sequence that is known to regulate the expression of GATA3.</description>

      <title>GRiNS: A Python Library for Simulating Gene Regulatory Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergent dynamics of complex gene regulatory networks govern various cellular processes. However, understanding these dynamics is challenging due to the difficulty of parameterizing the computational models for these networks, especially as the network size increases. Here, we introduce a simulation library, Gene Regulatory Interaction Network Simulator (GRiNS), to address these challenges. GRiNS integrates popular parameter-agnostic simulation frameworks, RACIPE and Boolean Ising formalism, into a single Python library capable of leveraging GPU acceleration for efficient and scalable simulations. GRiNS extends the ordinary differential equations (ODE) based RACIPE framework with a more modular design, allowing users to choose parameters, initial conditions, and time-series outputs for greater customisability and accuracy in simulations. For large networks, where ODE-based simulation formalisms do not scale well, GRiNS implements Boolean Ising formalism, providing a simplified, coarse-grained alternative, significantly reducing the computational cost while capturing key dynamical behaviours of large regulatory networks. The documentation and installation instructions for GRiNS can be found at https://moltenecdysone09.github.io/GRiNS/.</description>

      <title>HIGHT: Hierarchical Graph Tokenization for Molecule-Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in extending the success of large language models (LLMs) from texts to molecules. Most existing approaches adopt a graph neural network to represent a molecule as a series of node tokens for molecule-language alignment, which, however, have overlooked the inherent hierarchical structures in molecules. Notably, higher-order molecular structures contain rich semantics of functional groups, which encode crucial biochemical functionalities of the molecules. We show that neglecting the hierarchical information in tokenization will lead to subpar molecule-language alignment and severe hallucination. To address this limitation, we propose HIerarchical GrapH Tokenization (HIGHT). HIGHT employs a hierarchical graph tokenizer that encodes the hierarchy of atom, motif, and molecular levels of informative tokens to improve the molecular perception of LLMs. HIGHT also adopts an augmented instruction tuning dataset, enriched with the hierarchical graph information, to further enhance the molecule-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmarks verify the effectiveness of HIGHT in reducing hallucination by 40%, and significant improvements in various molecule-language downstream tasks. The project is available at https: //higraphllm.github.io/.</description>

      <title>m-KAILIN: Knowledge-Driven Agentic Scientific Corpus Distillation Framework for Biomedical Large Language Models Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Corpus distillation for biomedical large language models (LLMs) seeks to address the pressing challenge of insufficient quantity and quality in open-source annotated scientific corpora, which remains a bottleneck for effective LLM training in biomedical research. This paper proposes a knowledge-driven, agentic framework for scientific corpus distillation, tailored explicitly for LLM training in the biomedical domain, addressing the challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge. Central to our approach is a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data from vast scientific literature. This agentic framework collectively generates and refines domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement. Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.</description>
