      <title>The Risks of Industry Influence in Tech Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging information technologies like social media, search engines, and AI can have a broad impact on public health, political institutions, social dynamics, and the natural world. It is critical to develop a scientific understanding of these impacts to inform evidence-based technology policy that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits. Unlike most other global-scale scientific challenges, however, the data necessary for scientific progress are generated and controlled by the same industry that might be subject to evidence-based regulation. Moreover, technology companies historically have been, and continue to be, a major source of funding for this field. These asymmetries in information and funding raise significant concerns about the potential for undue industry influence on the scientific record. In this Perspective, we explore how technology companies can influence our scientific understanding of their products. We argue that science faces unique challenges in the context of technology research that will require strengthening existing safeguards and constructing wholly new ones.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Feature Importance for Online Content Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating how users respond to moderation interventions is paramount for developing effective and user-centred moderation strategies. However, this requires a clear understanding of which user characteristics are associated with different behavioural responses, which is the goal of this work. We investigate the informativeness of 753 socio-behavioural, linguistic, relational, and psychological features, in predicting the behavioural changes of 16.8K users affected by a major moderation intervention on Reddit. To reach this goal, we frame the problem in terms of "quantification", a task well-suited to estimating shifts in aggregate user behaviour. We then apply a greedy feature selection strategy with the double goal of (i) identifying the features that are most predictive of changes in user activity, toxicity, and participation diversity, and (ii) estimating their importance. Our results allow identifying a small set of features that are consistently informative across all tasks, and determining that many others are either task-specific or of limited utility altogether. We also find that predictive performance varies according to the task, with changes in activity and toxicity being easier to estimate than changes in diversity. Overall, our results pave the way for the development of accurate systems that predict user reactions to moderation interventions. Furthermore, our findings highlight the complexity of post-moderation user behaviour, and indicate that effective moderation should be tailored not only to user traits but also to the specific objective of the intervention.</description>

      <title>Drug-disease networks and drug repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repurposing existing drugs to treat new diseases is a cost-effective alternative to de novo drug development, but there are millions of potential drug-disease combinations to be considered with only a small fraction being viable. In silico predictions of drug-disease associations can be invaluable for reducing the size of the search space. In this work we present a novel network of drugs and the diseases they treat, compiled using a combination of existing textual and machine-readable databases, natural-language processing tools, and hand curation, and analyze it using network-based link prediction methods to identify potential drug-disease combinations. We measure the efficacy of these methods using cross-validation tests and find that several methods, particularly those based on graph embedding and network model fitting, achieve impressive prediction performance, significantly better than previous approaches, with area under the ROC curve above 0.95 and average precision almost a thousand times better than chance.</description>

      <title>Making Classic GNNs Strong Baselines Across Varying Homophily: A Smoothness-Generalization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success but are often considered to be challenged by varying levels of homophily in graphs. Recent empirical studies have surprisingly shown that homophilic GNNs can perform well across datasets of different homophily levels with proper hyperparameter tuning, but the underlying theory and effective architectures remain unclear. To advance GNN universality across varying homophily, we theoretically revisit GNN message passing and uncover a novel smoothness-generalization dilemma, where increasing hops inevitably enhances smoothness at the cost of generalization. This dilemma hinders learning in higher-order homophilic neighborhoods and all heterophilic ones, where generalization is critical due to complex neighborhood class distributions that are sensitive to shifts induced by noise and sparsity. To address this, we introduce the Inceptive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) built on three simple yet effective design principles, which alleviate the dilemma by enabling distinct hop-wise generalization alongside improved overall generalization with adaptive smoothness. Benchmarking against 30 baselines demonstrates IGNN's superiority and reveals notable universality in certain homophilic GNN variants. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/galogm/IGNN.</description>

      <title>Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14291v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</description>
