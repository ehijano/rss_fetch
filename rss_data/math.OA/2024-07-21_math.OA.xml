      <title>Higher-rank trees: Finite higher-rank planar trees arising from polyhedral graphs. Differences from one-trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of higher-rank graphs, whose construction was inspired by the graphical techniques of Lambek \cite{Lambek} and Johnstone \cite{Johnstone} used for monoid and category emedding results. We show that they are planar $k$-trees for $2 \le k \le 4$. We also show that higher-rank trees differ from $1$-trees by giving examples of higher-rank trees having properties which are impossible for $1$-trees. Finally, we collect more examples of higher-rank planar trees which are not in our family.</description>

      <title>Algebraic localization of generalized Wannier bases implies Roe triviality in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of understanding the localization topology correspondence for non periodic gapped quantum systems, we investigate the relation between the existence of an algebraically well-localized generalized Wannier basis and the topological triviality of the corresponding projection operator. Inspired by the work of M. Ludewig and G.C. Thiang, we consider the triviality of a projection in the sense of coarse geometry, i.e. as triviality in the $K_0$-theory of the Roe $C^*$-algebra of $\mathrm{R}^d$. We obtain in Theorem 2.8 a threshold, depending on the dimension, for the decay rate of the generalized Wannier functions which implies topological triviality in Roe sense. This threshold reduces, for $d = 2$, to the almost optimal threshold appearing in the Localization Dichotomy Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Shubin calculi for actions of graded Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a calculus of Shubin type pseudodifferential operators on certain non-compact spaces, using a groupoid approach similar to the one of van Erp and Yuncken. More concretely, we consider actions of graded Lie groups on graded vector spaces and study pseudodifferential operators that generalize fundamental vector fields and multiplication by polynomials. Our two main examples of elliptic operators in this calculus are Rockland operators with a potential and the generalizations of the harmonic oscillator to the Heisenberg group due to Rottensteiner-Ruzhansky.
  Deforming the action of the graded group, we define a tangent groupoid which connects pseudodifferential operators to their principal (co)symbols. We show that our operators form a calculus that is asymptotically complete. Elliptic elements in the calculus have parametrices, are hypoelliptic, and can be characterized in terms of a Rockland condition. Moreover, we study the mapping properties as well as the spectra of our operators on Sobolev spaces and compare our calculus to the Shubin calculus on $\mathbb R^n$ and its anisotropic generalizations.</description>
