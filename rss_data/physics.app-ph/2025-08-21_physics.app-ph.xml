      <title>Discovering correlations between metal foam thermal characteristics and non-Fourier behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their low density and large specific surface area, metal foams are increasingly used as cellular materials that combine excellent structural and thermal properties. Their cellular structure makes them particularly suitable for use in heat exchangers, insulation, and fire protection layers. The heat transport that takes place within them is a complex phenomenon characterized by the simultaneous presence of heat conduction, heat transfer, and heat radiation, making their modeling a significant challenge. The aim of the research is to develop a one-dimensional, time-dependent, discrete numerical model capable of describing the effective thermal behavior of metal foams. The model takes into account heat conduction through the solid phase, conductive heat transfer in the closed cavities, thermal radiation between the pore walls, and by-passing heat conduction around the cavity. The results highlight that geometric features such as cavity size and arrangement have a significant impact on temperature distribution and confirm that classical Fourier-based models are not accurately applicable to porous materials, but the Guyer--Krumhansl equation is an adequate candidate. Furthermore, we correlated the static and dynamic thermal diffusivity with the metal foam parameters, showing a significant sensitivity to the cavity thermal attributes.</description>

      <title>Attosecond high-harmonic interferometry probes orbital- and band-dependent dipole phase in magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control over the spatial coherence, wavefront, and focusability of emitted light relies on understanding the intrinsic phase of the emission process, and vice versa, measuring phase can reveal insights about microscopic generation mechanisms. A thorough understanding of the origin of the dipole phase in solid-state high-harmonic generation is currently missing. Here, by employing attosecond interferometry with phase-locked XUV pulses, we directly assess the intensity- and frequency-dependent dipole phases in magnesium oxide (MgO) in solid-state HHG. We also quantify a nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental and disentangle its contribution from the dipole phase. Theoretical models (analytical, two-band, and full-band numerical simulations) support our results. The analytical approach aids future solid-state HHG experiments and simulations, while the full numerical model details orbital- and band-resolved current contributions to the dipole phase. Our research delivers the first combined quantitative measurement and rigorous theoretical description of the harmonic emission phase in solids.</description>

      <title>Phase Matched Plasmonic Transmission Lines for Cascaded Second-Harmonic Generation as a Pathway to Nonlinear Logic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nonlinear nanophotonics, cascaded second-harmonic generation (SHG) in pure plasmonic waveguides for sequential signal transformation and complex on-chip functionality remains a long-standing challenge. Precise phase matching becomes instrumental to achieve efficient SHG and enable true cascading of nonlinear processes. We experimentally demonstrate phase matching in SHG is achievable in a plasmonic system between two orthogonal modes. Accurate tuning of plasmonic two-wire transmission-line (TWTL) design parameters result in SHG from the antisymmetric excitation mode being approximately 15 times stronger than that from the symmetric excitation mode, greatly raising the conversion efficiency to 0.021%. Simultaneously, phase matching extends our TWTL operational length up to 18${\mu}$m. Based on the improved efficiency and operational length, we demonstrate the feasibility of cascading multiple plasmonic waveguides. We further realize a nonlinear AND logic operation using a single 18${\mu}$m long waveguide. These results underscore the potential of phase matched plasmonic TWTLs for compact, efficient, and scalable nonlinear optical circuitry.</description>

      <title>Strong lead-free bioinspired piezoceramics for durable energy transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 40- to 600-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains stem from residual stress fields generated at the interface between silica pockets and BNT bricks, which delay crack initiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical.</description>

      <title>Tunable Light Emission from GaAsP and GaInP Islands Grown on Silicon (001) Nanotips Wafer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the monolithic integration of GaAsP and GaInP islands, selectively grown on a CMOS-compatible Si nanotip wafer using gas-source molecular beam epitaxy via a nanoheteroepitaxy approach. These alloys span a wide electronic bandgap range, from infrared to green; making them highly attractive for optoelectronic applications in silicon photonics. In addition, the nanoheteroepitaxy method enables the growth of various alloy combinations without the need for a lattice-matched substrate. We discuss the epitaxial challenges involved, particularly the balance between growth selectivity and alloy miscibility. Despite these challenges, our work demonstrates a promising and scalable route toward tunable light sources and detectors monolithically integrated on silicon, contributing to the development of compact and efficient photonic components for next-generation silicon-based technologies.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly electrical readout of individual skyrmion dynamics by anomalous Hall effect, correlated with real-time Kerr microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized spin textures, are promising candidates for future memory devices and non-conventional computing applications due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions, and low-power manipulation capabilities. Despite their significant potential, the reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous-Hall-effect-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. These advances establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion control and detection.</description>
