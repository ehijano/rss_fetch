      <title>Axes that matter: PCA with a difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the scope of differential machine learning and introduce a new breed of supervised principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality of Derivatives problems. Applications include the specification and calibration of pricing models, the identification of regression features in least-square Monte-Carlo, and the pre-processing of simulated datasets for (differential) machine learning.</description>

      <title>IVE: Enhanced Probabilistic Forecasting of Intraday Volume Ratio with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to volume ratio prediction in financial markets, specifically targeting the execution of Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) strategies. Recognizing the importance of accurate volume profile forecasting, our research leverages the Transformer architecture to predict intraday volume ratio at a one-minute scale. We diverge from prior models that use log-transformed volume or turnover rates, instead opting for a prediction model that accounts for the intraday volume ratio's high variability, stabilized via log-normal transformation. Our input data incorporates not only the statistical properties of volume but also external volume-related features, absolute time information, and stock-specific characteristics to enhance prediction accuracy. The model structure includes an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture with a distribution head for greedy sampling, optimizing performance on high-liquidity stocks across both Korean and American markets. We extend the capabilities of our model beyond point prediction by introducing probabilistic forecasting that captures the mean and standard deviation of volume ratios, enabling the anticipation of significant intraday volume spikes. Furthermore, an agent with a simple trading logic demonstrates the practical application of our model through live trading tests in the Korean market, outperforming VWAP benchmarks over a period of two and a half months. Our findings underscore the potential of Transformer-based probabilistic models for volume ratio prediction and pave the way for future research advancements in this domain.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Near-Optimal Online Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the problem of online portfolio selection as formulated by Cover (1991), the trader repeatedly distributes her capital over $ d $ assets in each of $ T &gt; 1 $ rounds, with the goal of maximizing the total return. Cover proposed an algorithm, termed Universal Portfolios, that performs nearly as well as the best (in hindsight) static assignment of a portfolio, with an $ O(d\log(T)) $ regret in terms of the logarithmic return. Without imposing any restrictions on the market this guarantee is known to be worst-case optimal, and no other algorithm attaining it has been discovered so far. Unfortunately, Cover's algorithm crucially relies on computing certain $ d $-dimensional integral which must be approximated in any implementation; this results in a prohibitive $ \tilde O(d^4(T+d)^{14}) $ per-round runtime for the fastest known implementation due to Kalai and Vempala (2002). We propose an algorithm for online portfolio selection that admits essentially the same regret guarantee as Universal Portfolios -- up to a constant factor and replacement of $ \log(T) $ with $ \log(T+d) $ -- yet has a drastically reduced runtime of $ \tilde O(d^2(T+d)) $ per round. The selected portfolio minimizes the current logarithmic loss regularized by the log-determinant of its Hessian -- equivalently, the hybrid logarithmic-volumetric barrier of the polytope specified by the asset return vectors. As such, our work reveals surprising connections of online portfolio selection with two classical topics in optimization theory: cutting-plane and interior-point algorithms.</description>

      <title>Moments by the Integrating the Moment-Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of a random variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive new expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both central and non-central moments. The new moment expressions are relatively simple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We label the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and can be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three applications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding densities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>TWICE: What Advantages Can Low-Resource Domain-Specific Embedding Model Bring? -- A Case Study on Korea Financial Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain specificity of embedding models is critical for effective performance. However, existing benchmarks, such as FinMTEB, are primarily designed for high-resource languages, leaving low-resource settings, such as Korean, under-explored. Directly translating established English benchmarks often fails to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances present in low-resource domains. In this paper, titled TWICE: What Advantages Can Low-Resource Domain-Specific Embedding Models Bring? A Case Study on Korea Financial Texts, we introduce KorFinMTEB, a novel benchmark for the Korean financial domain, specifically tailored to reflect its unique cultural characteristics in low-resource languages. Our experimental results reveal that while the models perform robustly on a translated version of FinMTEB, their performance on KorFinMTEB uncovers subtle yet critical discrepancies, especially in tasks requiring deeper semantic understanding, that underscore the limitations of direct translation. This discrepancy highlights the necessity of benchmarks that incorporate language-specific idiosyncrasies and cultural nuances. The insights from our study advocate for the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks that can more accurately assess and drive the progress of embedding models in low-resource settings.</description>
