      <title>Bridging Machine Learning and Cosmological Simulations: Using Neural Operators to emulate Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational expense of solving non-equilibrium chemistry equations in astrophysical simulations poses a significant challenge, particularly in high-resolution, large-scale cosmological models. In this work, we explore the potential of machine learning, specifically Neural Operators, to emulate the Grackle chemistry solver, which is widely used in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Neural Operators offer a mesh-free, data-driven approach to approximate solutions to coupled ordinary differential equations governing chemical evolution, gas cooling, and heating. We construct and train multiple Neural Operator architectures (DeepONet variants) using a dataset derived from cosmological simulations to optimize accuracy and efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the trained models accurately reproduce Grackle's outputs with an average error of less than 0.6 dex in most cases, though deviations increase in highly dynamic chemical environments. Compared to Grackle, the machine learning models provide computational speedups of up to a factor of six in large-scale simulations, highlighting their potential for reducing computational bottlenecks in astrophysical modeling. However, challenges remain, particularly in iterative applications where accumulated errors can lead to numerical instability. Additionally, the performance of these machine learning models is constrained by their need for well-represented training datasets and the limited extrapolation capabilities of deep learning methods. While promising, further development is required for Neural Operator-based emulators to be fully integrated into astrophysical simulations. Future work should focus on improving stability over iterative timesteps and optimizing implementations for hardware acceleration. This study provides an initial step toward the broader adoption of machine learning approaches in astrophysical chemistry solvers.</description>

      <title>Nearly a Decade of Groundbreaking Speckle Interferometry at the International Gemini Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: The Development of Machine Learning Tools for Detecting Millimeter Sources in Timestream Pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new machine learning algorithm for classifying short-duration features in raw time ordered data (TODs) of cosmic microwave background survey observations. The algorithm, specifically designed for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), works in conjunction with the previous TOD preprocessing techniques that employ statistical thresholding to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data, whether they are due to noise features, cosmic rays, or true astrophysical sources in a process called "data cuts". This has the undesirable effect of excising real astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The machine learning algorithm demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD pre-processing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our algorithm also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a sub-minute to minute light curve, providing information on its short timescale variability. This automated algorithm for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>A High-Accuracy Alignment Approach for Solar Images of Different Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image alignment plays a crucial role in solar physics research, primarily involving translation, rotation, and scaling. \G{The different wavelength images of the chromosphere and transition region have structural complexity and differences in similarity, which poses a challenge to their alignment.} Therefore, a novel alignment approach based on dense optical flow (OF) and the RANSAC algorithm is proposed in this paper. \G{It takes the OF vectors of similar regions between images to be used as feature points for matching. Then, it calculates scaling, rotation, and translation.} The study selects three wavelengths for two groups of alignment experiments: the 304 {\AA} of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), the 1216 {\AA} of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), and the 465 {\AA} of the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI). Two methods are used to evaluate alignment accuracy: Monte Carlo simulation and Uncertainty Analysis Based on the Jacobian Matrix (UABJM). \G{The evaluation results indicate that this approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy in the alignment of AIA 304 {\AA} and SDI 1216 {\AA}, while demonstrating higher accuracy in the alignment of AIA 304 {\AA} and SUTRI 465 {\AA}, which have greater similarity.</description>

      <title>Fast spectral line calculations with the escape probability method and tests with synthetic observations of interstellar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer effects need to be taken into account when analysing spectral line observations. When the data are not sufficient for detailed modelling, simpler methods are needed. The escape probability formalism (EPF) is one such tool. We wish to quantify the model errors in the EPF analysis of interstellar clouds and cores. We introduce PEP, a parallel program for calculating fast EPF parameters quickly. We model full radiative transfer to generate synthetic observations for various cloud models. These are examined with the PEP program, and their results are compared to the actual beam-averaged kinetic temperatures, column densities, and volume densities. PEP enables the calculations of even millions of parameter combinations in a matter of seconds. However, the simple assumptions of EPF can lead to significant errors. In the tests the errors were typically within a factor of two, but could in some cases reach an order of magnitude. The model errors are thus similar or even larger than the statistical errors caused by the typical observational noise. Due to degeneracies, parameter combinations are better constrained than the individual parameters. The model errors could be reduced by using full radiative transfer modelling. However, in the absence of full knowledge of the source structure, the errors are difficult to quantify. We also present a method for approximate handling of hyperfine structure lines in EPF calculations. Both the observational statistical errors and the model errors need to be considered when estimating the reliability of EPF results. Full radiative transfer modelling is needed to better understand the true uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A Novel Calibration and Imaging Method for ALMA Observations of SgrA$^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a novel method for the intra-field calibration and imaging of the radio source SgrA$^*$, observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SgrA$^*$ is a complex source comprising two components: the compact core (which exhibits high variability) and the extended minispiral (which is relatively stable over short timescales). The novel approach consists in a self-calibration method that employs the extended structure of the source (the minispiral) to calibrate the flux variability of the compact core. The algorithm involves several steps: (1) an initial CLEAN image is generated for the entire source; (2) the core is subtracted, leaving only the minispiral; (3) a two-component visibility model is constructed, comprising the minispiral and the core; (4) the model is fitted to the data, retrieving flux density parameters for each integration time; and (5) the data are scaled and calibrated, resulting in nearly constant brightness for the minispiral and variable flux for the core. The implementation of this algorithm through a script in the CASA package is described, detailing the configuration parameters and the steps involved. The success of the method is demonstrated through light curves of SgrA$^*$ observed on day 21 April 2018 in Band 6, as part of the 2018 EHT campaign. The light curves have been produced for Stokes I (total intensity), linear polarized intensity, EVPA (electric vector position angle), and Stokes V (circular polarization), providing valuable insights into the variability of this radio source.</description>

      <title>Self-calibration in two dimensional aperture mask optical interferometry: a new method for wavefront sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new methodology in optical aperture masking interferometry involving Fourier analysis of the complex visibilities (real and imaginary, or amplitude and phase), derived from the interferometric images. The analysis includes use of a non-redundant aperture mask, and self-calibration of the hole-based complex voltage gains to correct for non-uniform illumination and phase fluctuations across the mask. The technique is demonstrated using the Synchrotron Radiation Interferometry (SRI) facility at the ALBA synchrotron light source. Application of the technique results in a joint derivation of the Gaussian shape of the electron beam, and of the hole-based voltage gain amplitude and phase distribution over the mask area. The gain phases are linearly related to the photon path-lengths through the optical system for the ray to each hole, and hence represent an accurate wavefront sensor (WFS) determining the path-length distortions across the wavefront. Wavefront sensing is a vital technology in fields ranging from adaptive optics to metrology to optometry. We calculate that the rms precision of this WFS method is better than 1~nm per frame in the current experiment. We compare the technique to the standard Shack-Hartman WFS. We also show that a structure-agnostic imaging and deconvolution process can be used with the visibility data to determine the beam shape without assuming a Gaussian model, and hence the technique is generalizable to more complex source morphologies.</description>

      <title>A Census of the Most Obscured Galaxy Nuclei over Cosmic Time to be revealed by PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the growth of supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) is critical to the evolution of galaxies, however the majority of this activity is obscured, rendering traditional tracers of active SMBHs, such as in the restframe optical/UV, ineffective. The mid-infrared has been particularly successful in revealing obscured AGN activity however much of this work is confined to the local universe due to the lack of a far-IR telescope with the required sensitivity and wavelength coverage. In this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of PRIMA (PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics), a concept 1.8m far-IR observatory, to detect and characterize deeply obscured galaxy nuclei over cosmic time. With the PRIMAger instrument covering 25 - 235 $\mu$m, we find that we can accurately detect obscured nuclei via the deep silicate absorption at restframe $9.8 \mu$m between $z=2-7$. Additionally, the FIRESS spectrograph can produce R$\sim$100 spectra of obscured nuclei out to $z\sim7$, detecting Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), ices, ionized and molecular gas. With the large number of deeply obscured nuclei PRIMA can detect and characterize, such a mission is critical to understanding the growth of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as a new tool to characterise the Milky Way Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a star-forming region rich in molecular clouds located within hundreds of parsecs from the centre of our Galaxy, converts gas into stars less efficient than anticipated. A key challenge in refining star-formation models is the lack of precise mapping of these dense molecular hydrogen clouds, where traditional tracers often yield inconsistent results due to environmental limitations. We demonstrate how, in the not-so-far future, neutrinos will emerge as a robust mass tracer thanks to advancements in neutrino telescopes. Since neutrinos are produced alongside gamma-rays when cosmic-rays interact with molecular clouds, they offer a complementary, systematics-independent measurement of the gas density. In an optimistic case where most gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region originates from pion decays, we expect several tens of muon neutrinos to be detected in about two decades by KM3NeT, Baikal-GVD, and P-ONE combined, which will enable a better determination of the baryonic content in the Galactic Centre region. The CMZ will serve as a testbed to calibrate conventional tracers against neutrinos, ultimately improving gas measurements in distant galaxies, where neutrinos are undetectable, but traditional tracers remain available.</description>

      <title>From few to many maps: A fast map-level emulator for extreme augmentation of CMB systematics datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, fast, and efficient generative model built upon scattering covariances, the most recent iteration of the scattering transforms statistics. This model is designed to augment by several orders of magnitude the number of map simulations in datasets of computationally expensive CMB instrumental systematics simulations, including their non-Gaussian and inhomogeneous features. Unlike conventional neural network-based algorithms, this generative model requires only a minimal number of training samples, making it highly compatible with the computational constraints of typical CMB simulation campaigns. We validate the method using realistic simulations of CMB systematics, which are particularly challenging to emulate, and perform extensive statistical tests to confirm its ability to produce new statistically independent approximate realizations. Remarkably, even when trained on as few as 10 simulations, the emulator closely reproduces key summary statistics -- including the angular power spectrum, scattering coefficients, and Minkowski functionals -- and provides pixel-to-pixel covariance estimates with substantially reduced sample noise compared to those obtained without augmentation. The proposed approach has the potential to shift the paradigm in simulation campaign design. Instead of producing large numbers of low- or medium-accuracy simulations, future pipelines can focus on generating a few high-accuracy simulations that are then efficiently augmented using such generative model. This promises significant benefits for current and forthcoming cosmological surveys such as $Planck$, $LiteBIRD$, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, Euclid and Rubin-LSST. We make both the general framework for scattering transform statistics available at https://github.com/jmdelouis/HealpixML and the emulator available at https://github.com/pcampeti/CMBSCAT.</description>

      <title>Improving early detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars using CNNs and FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05068v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) with possible telescope follow-ups opens a window to ground-breaking discoveries in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. With the improved sensitivity of current and future GW detectors, more BNS detections are expected in the future. Therefore, enhancing low-latency GW search algorithms to achieve rapid speed, high accuracy, and low computational cost is essential. One innovative solution to reduce latency is the use of machine learning (ML) methods embedded in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present a novel \texttt{WaveNet}-based method, leveraging the state-of-the-art ML model, to produce early-warning alerts for BNS systems. Using simulated GW signals embedded in Gaussian noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors' third observing run (O3) as a proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate significant performance improvements. Compared to the current leading ML-based early-warning system, our approach enhances detection accuracy from 66.81\% to 76.22\% at a 1\% false alarm probability. Furthermore, we evaluate the time, energy, and economical cost of our model across CPU, GPU, and FPGA platforms, showcasing its potential for deployment in real-time gravitational wave detection pipelines.</description>

      <title>Fighting Newtonian Noise with Gradient-Based Optimization at the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newtonian noise in gravitational wave detectors originates from density fluctuations in the adjacency of the interferometer mirrors. At the Einstein Telescope, this noise source is expected to be dominant for low frequencies. Its impact is proposed to be reduced with the help of an array of seismometers that will be placed around the interferometer endpoints. We reformulate and implement the problem of finding the optimal seismometer positions in a differentiable way. We then explore the use of first-order gradient-based optimization for the design of the seismometer array for 1 Hz and 10 Hz and compare its performance and computational cost to two metaheuristic algorithms. For 1 Hz, we introduce a constraint term to prevent unphysical optimization results in the gradient-based method. In general, we find that it is an efficient strategy to initialize the gradient-based optimizer with a fast metaheuristic algorithm. For a small number of seismometers, this strategy results in approximately the same noise reduction as with the metaheuristics. For larger numbers of seismometers, gradient-based optimization outperforms the two metaheuristics by a factor of 2.25 for the faster of the two and a factor of 1.4 for the other one, which is significantly outperformed by gradient-based optimization in terms of computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Model misspecification analysis strategies, such as anomaly detection, model validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</description>

Abstract: Rotating black holes are the most powerful source of energy in the known universe, and are the cause of some of the most spectacular and extreme astronomical phenomena. The goal of this article is to analyze in simple terms the physics of energy extraction in rotating black holes. Specifically, the source of said energy, the efficiency of the energy extraction process, and some specific mechanisms that allow said extraction are analyzed. The article is intended primarily for undergraduate students of physics, astronomy and related fields.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based identification of Gaia astrometric exoplanet orbits</title>

Abstract: The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170\,000 astrometric orbit solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun. Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several Gaia DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine learning approach that uses only the Gaia DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions. Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 20 best candidates of which two are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. The companion around the Sun-like star G\,15-6 could be confirmed as a genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Model to Estimate Number Densities from Column Densities in Molecular Clouds</title>

Abstract: Constraining the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds is essential to our understanding of star formation. These investigations often necessitate knowledge of some local representative number density of the gas along the line of sight. However, constraining the number density is a difficult endeavor. Robust constraints of the number density often require line observations of specific molecules along with radiation transfer modeling, which provides densities traced by that specific molecule. Column density maps of molecular clouds are more readily available, with many high-fidelity maps calculated from dust emission and extinction, in particular from surveys conducted with the Herschel Space Observatory. We introduce a new probabilistic model which is based on the assumption that the total hydrogen nuclei column density along a line of sight can be decomposed into a turbulent component and a gravitationally-dominated component. Therefore, for each pixel in a column density map, the line of sight is decomposed into characteristic diffuse (dubbed ``turbulent'') and dense (dubbed ``gravitational'') gas number densities from column density maps. The method thus exploits a physical model of turbulence to decouple the random turbulent column from gas in dense bound structures empirically using the observed column density maps. We find the model produces reasonable turbulent and gravitational densities in the Taurus L1495/B213 and Polaris Flare clouds. The model can also be used to infer an effective attenuating column density into the cloud, which is useful for astrochemical models of the clouds. We conclude by demonstrating an application of this method by predicting the emission of the [C II], [C I], and CO (J = 1-0) lines across the Taurus L1495/B213 region at the native resolution of the column density map utilizing a grid of photodissociation-region models.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: A multidimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>The Spectroscopic Stage-5 Experiment</title>

Abstract: The existence, properties, and dynamics of the dark sectors of our universe pose fundamental challenges to our current model of physics, and large-scale astronomical surveys may be our only hope to unravel these long-standing mysteries. In this white paper, we describe the science motivation, instrumentation, and survey plan for the next-generation spectroscopic observatory, the Stage-5 Spectroscopic Experiment (Spec-S5). Spec-S5 is a new all-sky spectroscopic instrument optimized to efficiently carry out cosmological surveys of unprecedented scale and precision. The baseline plan for Spec-S5 involves upgrading two existing 4-m telescopes to new 6-m wide-field facilities, each with a highly multiplexed spectroscopic instrument capable of simultaneously measuring the spectra of 13,000 astronomical targets. Spec-S5, which builds and improves on the hardware used for previous cosmology experiments, represents a cost-effective and rapid approach to realizing a more than 10$\times$ gain in spectroscopic capability compared to the current state-of-the-art represented by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument project (DESI). Spec-S5 will provide a critical scientific capability in the post-Rubin and post-DESI era for advancing cosmology, fundamental physics, and astrophysics in the 2030s.</description>
