      <title>Might Normal Nuclear Matter be Quarkyonic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility that nuclear matter might be Quarkyonic is considered. Quarkyonic matter is high baryon density matter that is confined but can be approximately thought of as a filled Fermi sea of quarks surrounded by a shell of nucleons. Here, nuclear matter is described by the IdylliQ sigma model for Quarkyonic matter, generalizing the non-interacting IdylliQ model [Y. Fujimoto et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 112701 (2024) [arXiv:2306.04304]] to include interactions with a sigma meson and a pion. When such interactions are included, we find that isospin-symmetric nuclear matter binds, with acceptable values of the compressibility and other parameters for nuclear matter at saturation. The energy per nucleon and sound velocity of such matter is computed, and the isospin dependence is determined. Nuclear matter is formed at a density close to but slightly above the density at which Quarkyonic matter forms. Quarkyonic matter predicts a strong depletion of nucleons in normal nuclear matter at low momentum. Such a depletion for nucleon momenta $k \lesssim 120$ MeV is shown to be consistent with electron scattering data.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling of Hydrodynamics and Reactions in Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium for Modeling Convection in Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build on the simplified spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to handle the case of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and electron/positron captures/decays in the cores of massive stars. Our approach blends a traditional reaction network on the grid with a tabulated NSE state from a very large, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ nuclei, network. We demonstrate how to achieve second-order accuracy in the simplified-SDC framework when coupling NSE to hydrodynamics, with the ability to evolve the star on the hydrodynamics timestep. We discuss the application of this method to convection in massive stars leading up to core-collapse. We also show how to initialize the initial convective state from a 1D model in a self-consistent fashion. All of these developments are done in the publicly available Castro simulation code and the entire simulation methodology is fully GPU accelerated.</description>

      <title>Heavy multiquark systems as clusters of smaller units -- a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiquark systems appear less frequently than mesons and baryons despite the enormous world-wide experimental effort that has been made during the last two decades. In this work, we will propose a possible explanation for that fact, restricting ourselves to the case of sets including only $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks. We will show that those multiquarks can be thought as different combinations of smaller units that associate together to produce colorless assemblies with a definite value of the total spin. For instance, for the $cccccc$ hexaquark with $S=0$, we have three possibilities: a set of six undistinguishable $c$ quarks, an association of two $ccc$ baryons, or a set of three $cc$ diquarks close together. This means we can have three different values for the mass of an open-charm hexaquark with $S=0$. Using the diffusion Monte Carlo method, we calculate all possible combinations compatible with tetraquark $cc \bar{c} \bar{c}$, pentaquark $cccc \bar{c}$, open-charm $cccccc$ and hidden-charm $ccc \bar{c} \bar{c} \bar{c}$ hexaquark structures with the minimum value of total spin ($S=0$ or $S=1/2$). We consider compact structures with radial wave functions including interactions between all the quarks in the cluster. We find that, in all cases, the mass of the multiquark decreases with the number of small units that conform the set of quarks. For instance, an open charm hexaquark made up of three diquarks has a smaller mass than a set of six of $c$ undistinguishable units. When the pieces that conform the multiquark are themselves colorless with a definite value of the total spin, the cluster splits into those smaller units that separate infinitely from each other.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of $S$- and $P$-wave $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ $(\bar{q},\bar{q}' = \bar{u}, \bar{d}, \bar{s})$ systems in a chiral SU(3) quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the resonance $T_{cc}^+(3875)$ recently observed by the LHCb Collaboration, we systematically explore the $S$- and $P$-wave $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ $(\bar{q},\bar{q}' = \bar{u}, \bar{d}, \bar{s})$ systems in a chiral SU(3) quark model. The Hamiltonian contains the kinetic energy, the one-gluon-exchange (OGE) potential, the confinement potential, and the one-boson-exchange (OBE) potential stemming from the coupling of quark and chiral fields. The Schr\"odinger equation is solved by use of the variational method with the spacial trial wave functions chosen as Gaussian functions. It is found that the lowest state has a mass $3879$ MeV, isospin and spin-parity $IJ^P=01^+$, and quark constituent $cc\bar{u}\bar{d}$, in agreement with the experimentally observed $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. This state is approximately at the calculated $DD^\ast$ threshold, and has a root-mean-square radius about $0.48$ fm. These demonstrates that the $T_{cc}^+(3875)$ can be accommodated as a stable and compact tetraquark sate in the chiral SU(3) quark model. All the other $S$- and $P$-wave $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ $(\bar{q},\bar{q}' = \bar{u}, \bar{d}, \bar{s})$ states lie about one hundred to few hundreds MeV higher than the corresponding meson-meson thresholds, and thus are not suggested to be candidates of stable and compact tetraquark states due to their fall-apart decays to two mesons.</description>

      <title>Contact interactions, self-adjoint extensions, and low-energy scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy scattering is well described by the effective-range expansion. In quantum mechanics, a tower of contact interactions can generate terms in this expansion after renormalization. Scattering parameters are also encoded in the self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian. We briefly review this well-known result for two particles with s-wave interactions using impenetrable self-adjoint extensions, including the case of harmonically trapped two-particle states. By contrast, the one-dimensional scattering problem is surprisingly intricate. We show that the families of self-adjoint extensions correspond to a coupled system of symmetric and antisymmetric outgoing waves, which is diagonalized by an SU(2) transformation that accounts for mixing and a relative phase. This is corroborated by an effective theory computation that includes all four energy-independent contact interactions. The equivalence of various one-dimensional contact interactions is discussed and scrutinized from the perspective of renormalization. As an application, the spectrum of a general point interaction with a harmonic trap is solved in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Open Quantum Systems with Kadanoff-Baym Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the temporal evolution of quantum mechanical fermionic particles exhibiting one bound state within a one-dimensional attractive square-well potential in a heat bath of bosonic particles. For this open quantum system we formulate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles by taking the interactions to be elastic 2-2 scatterings with the heat-bath particles. The corresponding spatially imhomogeneous integro-differential equations for the one-particle Greens's function are solved numerically. We demonstrate how the system particles equilibrate and thermalize with the heat bath and how the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, expressed in the one-particle energy eigenbasis, decohere, so that only the diagonal entries, i.e. the occupation numbers, survive. In addition, the time evolution of the (retarded) Green's function also determines the spectral properties of the various one-particle quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Eigenvector continuation is a computational method for parametric eigenvalue problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts, discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent applications for quantum systems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Constraining a relativistic mean field model using neutron star mass-radius measurements I: Nucleonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of neutron star mass and radius or tidal deformability deliver unique insight into the equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter. EOS inference is very often done using generalized parametric or non-parametric models which deliver no information on composition. In this paper we consider a microscopic nuclear EOS model based on a field theoretical approach. We show that current measurements from NICER and gravitational wave observations constrain primarily the symmetric nuclear matter EOS. We then explore what could be delivered by measurements of mass and radius at the level anticipated for future large-area X-ray timing telescopes. These should be able to place very strong limits on the symmetric nuclear matter EOS, in addition to constraining the nuclear symmetry energy that determines the proton fraction inside the neutron star.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) polarization in proton-proton collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production mechanisms of charmonium states in both hadronic and heavy-ion collisions hold great significance for investigating the hot and dense QCD matter. Studying charmonium polarization in ultra-relativistic collisions can also provide insights into the underlying production mechanisms. With this motivation, we explore the $J/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) polarization in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7, 8, and 13 TeV using a pQCD-inspired Monte-Carlo event generator called PYTHIA8. This work considers reconstructed quarkonia through their dimuons decay channel in the ALICE forward rapidity acceptance range of $2.5 &lt; y_{\mu \mu} &lt; 4$. Further, we calculate the polarization parameters $\lambda_{\theta}$, $\lambda_{\phi}$, $\lambda_{\theta \phi}$ from the polar and azimuthal angular distributions of the dimuons in helicity and Collins-Soper frames. This study presents a comprehensive measurement of the polarization parameters as a function of transverse momentum, charged-particle multiplicity, and rapidity at the LHC energies. Our findings of charmonium polarization are in qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental data.</description>

      <title>Transversity PDFs of the proton from lattice QCD with physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the transversity isovector- and isoscalar-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton utilizing a perturbative matching at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy. Additionally, we determine the isovector and isoscalar tensor charges for the proton. In both calculations, the disconnected contributions to the isoscalar matrix elements have been ignored. The calculations are performed using a single ensemble of $N_f = 2 +1$ highly-improved staggered quarks simulated with physical-mass quarks and a lattice spacing of $a = 0.076$ fm. The Wilson-clover action, with physical quark masses and smeared gauge links obtained from one iteration of hypercubic smearing, is used in the valence sector. Using the NLO operator product expansion, we extract the lowest four to six Mellin moments and the PDFs via a neural network from the matrix elements in the pseudo-PDF approach. In addition, we calculate the PDFs in the quasi-PDF approach with hybrid-scheme renormalization and the recently developed leading-renormalon resummation technique, at NLO with the resummation of leading small-$x$ logarithms.</description>
