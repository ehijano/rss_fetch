      <title>A Cluster Expansion and the Decay of Correlations of the 1D Long-Range Ising Model at Low Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a convergent low-temperature cluster expansion of the one-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic Ising model with polynomial decay $\alpha\in (1,2]$ is developed; that is, $J(r)=r^{-\alpha}$. As an application, the $n$-point correlations are studied and the two-point correlation is shown to be algebraic with rate of decay exactly $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Resonant Excitation of Surface Plasmon for Wakefield Acceleration by Beating GW Lasers on Smooth Cylindrical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and numerical study of resonant surface-plasmon (SP) excitation driven by the beating of two co-propagating laser pulses on a smooth cylindrical plasma-vacuum interface. Analytical expressions for the SP dispersion relation, field amplitude, geometric coupling factor, and resonance conditions are derived and validated by fully three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We reveal that curvature-induced geometric effects can substantially modify the SP dispersion and enable resonant matching by laser beat waves. This is inaccessible in planar geometries or with a single laser. Under matched resonance conditions, a high-amplitude SP-based wakefield can be generated by a few gigawatt lasers, placing this mechanism within reach of state-of-the-art fibre lasers. It therefore opens a route toward portable laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerators.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the integral form of Gauss' law for a generic case of electrodynamics with arbitrarily moving Gaussian surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have re-examined the integral form of Gauss' law for arbitrarily moving charges inside and outside an arbitrarily expanding (or contracting) and deforming Gaussian surface. We have explicitly calculated the time-dependent Gauss' flux integral for such a generic non-static case with the Maxwell equations under consideration. We have obtained an evolution equation $\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\text{t}}\oint_{s(t)}\vec{E}\cdot\text{d}\vec{s}(t)=\frac{I^{(s)}_{\text{in}}(t)}{\epsilon_0}$ for the time-dependence of the flux-integral. We have pedagogically demonstrated that while the flux integral is dependent on the expansion/contraction of the surface, it is independent of its deformation.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of the classical Maxwell's equations in free space from the perspective of the correspondence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the advent of Quantum Mechanics' 100th anniversary in 2025, we wrote this review paper in order to present a discussion that addresses the foundations of this theory. And since the creation of this Mechanics and other quantum theories was guided, for instance, by correspondence principles that needed to be identified between them and other well-established physical theories, this paper will be devoted to discussing the correspondence between these quantum theories and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. More precisely, what we will do throughout this paper is discuss how the Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in free space and the stronger formulation of the correspondence principle already pointed, together, to the basis of a Quantum Mechanics that was only be formulated half a century later. And, in order to make this very clear, we will show that the quantum-mechanical description of a photon can already be identified, simply, by manipulating Maxwell's equations in free space with mathematical resources that, for instance, were already well known before the advent of Quantum Mechanics.</description>
