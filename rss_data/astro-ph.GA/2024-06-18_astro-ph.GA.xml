      <title>Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their spectral energy distributions can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes eight LRDs from the CEERS survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) at 0.53 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that the SEDs of all the LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with the best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 40% and 85%. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies -- by $\sim 2$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases -- compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.</description>

      <title>Bursty Star Formation in Dwarfs is Sensitive to Numerical Choices in Supernova Feedback Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of galaxy formation are mostly unable to resolve the energy-conserving phase of individual supernova events, having to resort to subgrid models to distribute the energy and momentum resulting from stellar feedback. However, the properties of these simulated galaxies, including the morphology, stellar mass formed and the burstiness of the star formation history, are highly sensitive to numerical choices adopted in these subgrid models. Using the {\small SMUGGLE} stellar feedback model, we compute idealized simulations of a $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{10} \, \msun$ dwarf galaxy, a regime where most simulation codes predict significant burstiness in star formation, resulting in strong gas flows that lead to the formation of dark matter cores. We find that by varying only the directional distribution of momentum imparted from supernovae to the surrounding gas, while holding the total momentum per supernova constant, bursty star formation may be amplified or completely suppressed, and the total stellar mass formed can vary by as much as a factor of $\sim 3$. In particular, when momentum is primarily directed perpendicular to the gas disk, less bursty and lower overall star formation rates result, yielding less gas turbulence, more disky morphologies and a retention of cuspy dark matter density profiles. An improved understanding of the non-linear coupling of stellar feedback into inhomogeneous gaseous media is thus needed to make robust predictions for stellar morphologies and dark matter core formation in dwarfs independent of uncertain numerical choices in the baryonic treatment.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: The over-abundance and physical nature of "little red dots"--Implications for early galaxy and SMBH assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of compact and extremely red galaxies at $z&gt;4$, which likely host active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present a sample of 434 ``little red dots'' (LRDs), selected from the 0.54 deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey. We fit galaxy and AGN SED models to derive redshifts and physical properties; the sample spans $z\sim5$-$9$ after removing brown dwarf contaminants. We consider two extreme physical scenarios: either LRDs are all AGN, and their continuum emission is dominated by the accretion disk, or they are all compact star-forming galaxies, and their continuum is dominated by stars. If LRDs are AGN-dominated, our sample exhibits bolometric luminosities $\sim10^{45-47}$ erg\,s$^{-1}$, spanning the gap between JWST AGN in the literature and bright, rare quasars. We derive a bolometric luminosity function (LF) $\sim100$ times the (UV-selected) quasar LF, implying a non-evolving black hole accretion density of $\sim10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ from $z\sim2$-$9$. By contrast, if LRDs are dominated by star formation, we derive stellar masses $\sim10^{8.5-10}\,M_\odot$. MIRI/F770W is key to deriving accurate stellar masses; without it, we derive a mass function inconsistent with $\Lambda$CDM. The median stellar mass profile is broadly consistent with the maximal stellar mass surface densities seen in the nearby universe, though the most massive $\sim50$\% of objects exceed this limit, requiring substantial AGN contribution to the continuum. Nevertheless, stacking all available X-ray, mid-IR, far-IR/sub-mm, and radio data yields non-detections. Whether dominated by dusty AGN, compact star-formation, or both, the high masses/luminosities and remarkable abundance of LRDs implies a dominant mode of early galaxy/SMBH growth.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: JWST/NIRSpec IFS view of the z~3.5 galaxy GS5001 and its close environment at the core of a large-scale overdensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec observations in IFS mode of the galaxy GS5001 at redshift z=3.47, the brightest member of a candidate protocluster in the GOODS-S field. The data cover a field of view (FoV) of 4''$\times$4'' (~$30\times30$~kpc$^2$) and were obtained as part of the GA-NIFS GTO program. The observations include both high (R~2700) and low (R~100) spectral resolution data, spanning the rest-frame wavelength ranges 3700-6780A and 1300-11850A, respectively. We analyse the spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics and interstellar medium properties, including obscuration, gas metallicity, excitation, ionisation parameter, and electron density. In addition to the central galaxy, the NIRSpec FoV covers three components in the south, with velocities blue-shifted by -150 km/s with respect to the main galaxy, and another source in the north redshifted by ~200 km/s. The emission line ratios in the BPT diagram are consistent with star formation for all the sources in the FoV. We measure electron densities of ~500 cm$^{-3}$ in the different sources. The gas-phase metallicity in the main galaxy is 12+log(O/H) $= 8.45\pm0.04$, and slightly lower in the companions (12+log(O/H)$ = 8.34-8.42$), consistent with the mass-metallicity relation at $z\sim3$. We find peculiar line ratios (high log [NII]/H$\alpha$, low log [OIII]/H$\beta$) in the northern part of the main galaxy (GS5001). These could be attributed to either higher metallicity, or to shocks resulting from the interaction of the main galaxy with the northern source. We identify a spatially resolved outflow in the main galaxy, with an extension of about 3 kpc. We find maximum outflow velocities of ~400 km/s, an outflow mass of $(1.7\pm0.4)\times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$, a mass outflow rate of $23\pm5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a mass loading factor of 0.23. These properties are compatible with star formation being the driver of the outflow.</description>

      <title>MUSE Analysis of Gas around Galaxies (MAGG) -- VI. The cool and enriched gas environment of z$\gtrsim$3 Ly$\alpha$ emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel dataset that extends our view of the cosmic gas around z$\approx$3-4 Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) in the Muse Analysis of Gas around Galaxies (MAGG) survey by tracing a cool and enriched gas phase through 47 MgII absorbers identified in newly-obtained VLT/XSHOOTER near-infrared quasar spectra. Jointly with the more ionized gas traced by CIV systems and the neutral HI from previous work, we find that LAEs are distributed inside cosmic structures that contain multiphase gas in composition and temperature. All gas phases are a strong function of the large-scale galaxy environment: the MgII and the CIV strength and kinematics positively correlate with the number of associated galaxies, and it is $\approx$3-4 times more likely to detect metal absorbers around group than isolated LAEs. Exploring the redshift evolution, the covering factor of MgII around group and isolated LAEs remains approximately constant from z$\approx$3-4 to z&lt;2, but the one of CIV around group galaxies drops by z&lt;2. Adding the cool enriched gas traced by the MgII absorbers to the results we obtained for the HI and CIV gas, we put forward a picture in which LAEs lie along gas filaments that contain high column-density HI systems and are enriched by strong CIV and MgII absorbers. While the MgII gas appears to be more centrally concentrated near LAEs, weaker CIV systems trace instead a more diffuse gas phase extended up to larger distances around the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the kinematic age of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group from up-to-date data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematics of about 40 single stars belonging to the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group is studied. The age of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group is estimated from these stars with ground-based line-of-sight velocity determinations by two methods. Both estimates are kinematic. In the first method we considered the traceback trajectories of the stars, giving an estimate of $t=13.2\pm1.4$ Myr. In the second method, by analyzing the instantaneous velocities of the stars, we show that there is an expansion of the stellar system occurring in the Galactic $xy$ plane. Based on this effect, we find the time interval elapsed from the beginning of the expansion of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group to the present day, $t=20\pm2$ Myr.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Star-forming Sites in the Outer Galactic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to investigate the global star formation scenario in star-forming sites AFGL 5157, [FSR2007] 0807 (hereafter FSR0807), [HKS2019] E70 (hereafter E70), [KPS2012] MWSC 0620 (hereafter KPS0620), and IRAS 05331+3115 in the outer galactic arm. The distribution of young stellar objects in these sites coincides with a higher extinction and H2 column density, which agrees with the notion that star formation occurs inside the dense molecular cloud cores. We have found two molecular structures at different velocities in this direction; one contains AFGL 5157 and FSR0807, and the other contains E70, [KPS2012] MWSC 0620, and IRAS 05331+3115. All these clusters in our target region are in different evolutionary stages and might form stars through different mechanisms. The E70 cluster seems to be the oldest in our sample; AFGL 5157 and FSR0807 formed later, and KPS0620 and IRAS 05331+3115 are the youngest sites. AFGL 5157 and FSR0807 are physically connected and have cold filamentary structures and dense hub regions. Additionally, the near-infrared photometric analysis shows signatures of massive star formation in these sites. KPS0620 also seems to have cold filamentary structures with the central hub but lacks signatures of massive stars. Our analysis suggests molecular gas flow and the hub filamentary star formation scenario in these regions. IRAS 05331+3115 is a single clump of molecular gas favoring low-mass star formation. Our study suggests that the selected area is a menagerie of star-forming sites where the formation of the stars happens through different processes.</description>

      <title>Chemical compositions of semi-regular variable red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sample of warm low level semi-regular variables chosen from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars is studied for their chemical compositions by analysing high resolution optical spectra. The abundance ratios from Na/Fe to Eu/Fe displayed by these and previously analysed semi-regular variables are quite similar to ratios displayed by normal red giants across the Galactic thin and thick disks and halo populations in the solar neighbourhood suggesting from this perspective that the variables may be among the more photometrically active red giants.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent dynamical models with a finite extent -- IV. Wendland models based on compactly supported radial basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new step in our systematic effort to develop self-consistent dynamical models with a finite radial extent. The focus is on models with simple analytical density profiles allowing for analytical calculations of many dynamical properties. In this paper, we introduce a family of models, termed Wendland models, based on compactly supported radial basis functions. The family of models is characterised by a parameter $k$ that controls the smoothness of the transition at the truncation radius. In the limit $k\to\infty$, the Wendland model reduces to a non-truncated model with a Gaussian density profile. For each Wendland model, the density, mass and gravitational potential are simple truncated polynomial functions of radius. Via the SpheCow tool we demonstrate that all Wendland models can be supported by isotropic distribution functions. Surprisingly, the isotropic distribution function exhibits varied behaviour across different Wendland models. Additionally, each model can be supported by a continuum of Osipkov--Merritt orbital structures, ranging from radially anisotropic to completely tangential at the truncation radius. To the best of our knowledge, the Wendland models presented here are the first family of models accommodating both radial and tangential Osipkov--Merritt distribution functions. Using linear superposition, these models can easily be combined to generate Wendland models with even more diverse orbital structures. While the Wendland models are not fully representative of real dynamical systems due to their Gaussian-like density profile, this study lays important groundwork for constructing more realistic models with truncated density profiles that can be supported by a range of orbital structures.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: the Tully-Fisher relation in the NGC 4808, Vela and NGC 5044 fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tully-Fisher Relation (TFR) is a well-known empirical relationship between the luminosity of a spiral galaxy and its circular velocity, allowing us to estimate redshift independent distances. Here we use high signal-to-noise HI 21-cm integrated spectra from the second pilot data release (PDR2, 180 deg2) of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY). In order to prepare for the full WALLABY survey, we have investigated the TFR in phase 2 of the pilot survey with a further three fields. The data were obtained with wide-field Phased Array Feeds on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and have an angular resolution of 30 arcsec and a velocity resolution of ~4 km/s. Galaxy luminosities have been measured from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and optical galaxy inclinations from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. We present TFRs for wavelengths from 0.8-3.4{\mu}m. We examine sources of galaxy inclination data and investigate magnitudes from the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey (DELVE) and DENIS catalogues and the 4HS target catalogue based on the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS). We consider the baryonic TFR. These are all of interest for TFR using the full WALLABY survey of 200,000 galaxies. We demonstrate that WALLABY TFR distances can take their place among state of the art studies of the local velocity field.</description>

      <title>On the limitations of H alpha luminosity as a star formation tracer in spatially resolved observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the limitations of H$\alpha$ luminosity as a tracer of star formation rates (SFR) in spatially resolved observations. We carry out high-resolution simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy including both supernova and photoionization feedback, and from these we generate synthetic H$\alpha$ emission maps that we compare to maps of the true distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs) on scales from whole-galaxy to individual molecular clouds ($\lesssim 100$ pc). Our results reveal significant spatial mismatches between H$\alpha$ and true YSO maps on sub-100 pc scales, primarily due to ionizing photon leakage, with a secondary contribution from young stars drifting away from their parent molecular clouds. On small scales these effect contribute significantly to the observed anti-correlation between gas and star formation, such that there is noticeably less anti-correlation if we replace an H$\alpha$-based star formation map with a YSO-based one; this in turn implies that previous studies have underestimated the time it takes for young stars to disperse their parent molecular clouds. However, these effects are limited in dense regions with hydrogen columns $N_\mathrm{H} &gt; 3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, where the H$\alpha$- and YSO-based SFR maps show better agreement. Based on this finding we propose a calibration model that can precisely measure the SFR of large molecular clouds (mean radius &gt; 100 pc) with a combination of H$\alpha$ and CO observations, which provides a foundation for future study of star formation processes in extragalactic molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dust Extinction and Spatially Resolved Paschen-$\alpha$ Emission within 97 Galaxies at $1&lt;z&lt;1.6$ with JWST NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on the Paschen-$\alpha$ (Pa$\alpha$) emitting galaxies observed as part of the JWST FRESCO survey in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Utilizing the JWST NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS), we analyze emission line fluxes, star formation rates (SFRs), and spatially resolved flux distributions of 97 Pa$\alpha$ emitters at $1&lt;z&lt;1.6$. To assess dust extinction within our sample, we combine Pa$\alpha$ fluxes with archival H$\alpha$ data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 G141 grism. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between dust extinction and galaxy stellar mass, where more massive galaxies exhibit greater dust extinction. We employ two-dimensional Pa$\alpha$ and F444W mapping to trace the distributions of star formation and stellar mass, respectively. Our observations indicate that lower mass galaxies are almost dust free in Pa$\alpha$ and exhibit smaller sizes both in star formation and underlying stellar continuum. In contrast, galaxies with a stellar mass greater than $10^{9.5}M_\odot$ display diverse dust extinction and star formation patterns. This variation suggests that the structures and properties of massive galaxies evolve through different phases, which involve, e.g., star formation in massive clumps, compaction, and inside-out quenching. This study demonstrates the capabilities of JWST WFSS in conducting systematic investigations of emission line galaxies and highlights the pivotal role of Pa$\alpha$ in advancing our understanding of dust extinction and obscured star formation in the early universe.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of the active galactic nucleus and star formation characteristics of broad and narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here our comparative analysis of active galactic nucleus (AGN) and star formation (SF) characteristics of a sample of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) and broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1) galaxies. Our sample consisted of 373 BLS1 and 240 NLS1 galaxies spanning the redshift 0.02 to 0.8. The broad-band spectral energy distribution, constructed using data from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared, was modelled using CIGALE to derive the basic properties of our sample. We searched for differences in stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and AGN luminosity in the two populations. We also estimated new radiation-pressure corrected black hole masses for our sample of BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies. While the virial black hole mass (MBH) of BLS1 galaxies is similar to their radiation-pressure corrected MBH values, the virial MBH values of NLS1 galaxies are underestimated. We found that NLS1 galaxies have a lower MBH of log (MBH) = 7.45 +/- 0.27 and a higher log (Eddington ratio) of -0.72 +/- 0.22 than BLS1 galaxies, which have log (MBH) and log (Eddington ratio) of 8.04 +/- 0.26 and -1.08 +/- 0.24, respectively. The distributions of stellar mass, SFR, and specific star formation (sSFR = SFR/stellar mass) for the two populations are indistinguishable. This analysis is based on an independent approach and contradicts reports in the literature that NLS1 galaxies have a higher SF than BLS1 galaxies. While we found that AGN luminosity increases with stellar mass, luminosity of SF flattens at high stellar mass for both BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies. The reason may be that SF is suppressed by AGN feedback at stellar mass higher than 10^11 solar mass or that the AGN fuelling mechanism is decoupled from SF. Separating the sample into radio-detected and radio-undetected subsamples, we found no difference in their SF properties suggesting that the effect of AGN jets on SF is negligible.</description>

      <title>Disk Assembly of the Milky Way Suggested from the Time-resolved Chemical Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both simulations and observations suggest that the disk assembly of galaxies is governed by the interplay between coplanar gas inflow, ex-planar gas outflow and in-situ star formation on the disk, known as the leaky accretion disk. This scenario predicts a strong connection between radial distributions of star formation and chemical abundances. The Milky Way, being the sole galaxy where we can reliably measure star formation histories and the corresponding temporally-resolved chemical abundances with individual stars, provides a unique opportunity to scrutinize this scenario. Based on the recent large spectroscopic and photometric surveys of Milky Way stars, we obtain the radial profiles of magnesium abundance ([Mg/H]) and star formation rate (SFR) surface density at different lookback time. We find the radial profiles of [Mg/H] can be well-reproduced using the leaky accretion disk model with only two free parameters for stars formed within 4 Gyr, as well as the flattening at large radii of metallicity profiles traced by HII regions and Cepheids. Furthermore, the constraint effective yield of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies show broad consistency with the theoretical predictions from stellar chemical evolution model with a mass-loading factor of 0-2. These results support that the recent assembly of the Milky Way adheres to the leaky accretion disk scenario, bridging the disk formation of our home galaxy to the big picture of disk formation in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the imprint of AGN feedback in Seyfert galaxies: Nuclear-scale molecular gas deficits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a sample of 64 nearby (D=7-45 Mpc) disk galaxies including 45 AGN and 19 non-AGN, that have high spatial resolution multiline CO observations obtained with the ALMA and/or PdBI arrays to study the distribution of cold molecular gas in their circumunuclear disks (CND). We analyze whether the concentration of cold molecular gas changes as a function of the X-ray luminosity in the 2-10 keV range ($L_{\rm X}$). We also study the concentration of the hot molecular gas using NIR data obtained for the H2 1-0S(1) line. We find a turnover in the distribution of the cold molecular gas concentration as a function of $L_{\rm X}$ with a breakpoint which divides the sample into two branches: the AGN build-up branch ($L_{\rm X}\leq10^{41.5\pm0.3}$erg/s) and the AGN feedback branch ($L_{\rm X}\geq10^{41.5\pm0.3}$erg/s) . Lower luminosity AGN and non-AGN of the AGN build-up branch show high cold molecular gas concentrations and centrally peaked radial profiles on nuclear ($r\leq50$~pc) scales. Higher luminosity AGN of the AGN feedback branch, show a sharp decrease in the concentration of molecular gas and flat or inverted radial profiles. The cold molecular gas concentration index ($CCI$), defined as the ratio of surface densities at $r\leq50$~pc and $r\leq200$~pc , namely $CCI \equiv$~log$_{\rm 10}(\Sigma^{\rm gas}_{\rm 50}/\Sigma^{\rm gas}_{\rm 200}$), spans a factor ~4-5 between the galaxies lying at the high end of the AGN build-up branch and the galaxies of the AGN feedback branch. The concentration and radial distributions of the hot molecular gas in our sample follow less extreme trends as a function of the X-ray luminosity. These observations confirm, on a three times larger sample, previous evidence found by the GATOS survey that the imprint of AGN feedback on the CND-scale distribution of molecular gas is more extreme in higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies of the local universe.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in Galaxies as seen with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of mid-infrared spectra of galaxies including star-forming galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei observed with JWST MIRI-MRS and NIRSpec-IFU. We focus on the relative variations of the 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 11.3, 12.7 and 17 micron Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features within spatially resolved regions of galaxies including NGC 3256, NGC 7469, VV 114, II Zw96 and NGC 5728. Using theoretical PAH models and extending our earlier work, we introduce a new PAH diagnostic involving the 17 micron PAH feature. To determine the drivers of PAH band variations in galaxies, we compare observed PAH spectral bands to predictions from theoretical PAH models. We consider extinction, dehydrogenation and PAH size and charge as possible drivers of PAH band variations. We find a surprising uniformity in PAH size distribution among the spatially resolved regions of the galaxies studied here, with no evidence for preferential destruction of the smallest grains, contrary to earlier findings. Neither extinction nor dehydrogenation play a crucial role in setting the observed PAH bands. Instead, we find that PAH charge plays a significant role in PAH inter-band variations. We find a tight relation between PAH charge and the intensity of the radiation field as traced by the [NeIII]/[NeII] maps. In agreement with recent JWST results, we find a predominance of neutral PAH molecules in the nuclei of Active Galaxies and their outflows. Ionised PAHs are the dominant population in star-forming galaxies. We discuss the implications of our findings for the use of PAHs as ISM tracers in high redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous Catch of a Giant Jellyfish: an Ionized Nebula around 3C 275.1 with 170 kpc Long Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3C 275.1 is a blue quasar at $z=0.55522$, hosting powerful outflows and residing in a complex environment. We present a serendipitously detected giant nebula surrounding 3C 275.1, which shows morphological features resembling those of objects known as "jellyfish galaxy", with extremely long tails of ionized gas extending to 170 kpc in projection. We analyze its optical spectra taken by the MUSE on the VLT. The brighter part of this giant nebula exceeds 100 kpc, whose rotation curve does not flatten out, is very different from those of normal spiral galaxies. This system shares some characteristics common to those formed via ram pressure stripping (RPS), yet its long narrow tails and higher ionization are unusual compared to known tails in jellyfish galaxies, not fully consistent with a simple RPS scenario. Our photoionization simulation and the inferred short recombination timescale both suggest that besides the quasar 3C 275.1, an extra source of ionization is necessary to keep the gas ionized at such distance from the nucleus, which could be related to RPS, tidal interaction or AGN outflow, providing new evidence of active dynamical interaction of a galaxy with the intracluster medium.</description>

      <title>On the use of far-infrared and sub-millimeter line ratios to constrain the physical properties of gas in high-z galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical emission line diagnostics, which are a common tool to constrain the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, become progressively inaccessible at higher redshifts for ground-based facilities. Far-infrared (FIR) emission lines, which are redshifted into atmospheric windows accessible by ground-based sub-millimeter facilities, could provide alternative ISM diagnostics to optical emission lines. We investigate FIR line ratios involving [CII]$\lambda 158 \mu$m, [OIII]$\lambda 88 \mu$m, [OIII]$\lambda 52 \mu$m, [NII]$\lambda 122 \mu$m and [NIII$\lambda 57 \mu$m, using synthetic emission lines applied to a high-resolution (m$_{\rm gas}$= 883.4 M$_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation, including radiative-transfer post processing with KramsesRT at z = 6.5. We find that the [CII]/[NII]122 ratio is sensitive to the temperature and density of photo-dissociation regions, and thus could be a useful tool to trace the properties of this gas phase in galaxies. We also find that [NII]/[NIII] is a good tracer of the temperature and [OIII]52/[OIII]88 a good tracer of the gas density of HII regions. Emission line ratios containing the [OIII]$\lambda 88 \mu$m line are sensitive to high velocity outflowing gas.</description>

      <title>PRIMER: JWST/MIRI reveals the evolution of star-forming structures in galaxies at z&lt;2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar structures of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) undergo significant size growth during their mass assembly and must pass through a compaction phase as they evolve into quiescent galaxies (QGs). To shed light on the mechanisms behind this structural evolution, we study the morphology of the star-forming components of 665 SFGs at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5 measured using JWST/MIRI observation and compare them with the morphology of their stellar components taken from the literature. The stellar and star-forming components of most SFGs (66%) have extended disk-like structures that are aligned with each other and are of the same size. The star-forming components of these galaxies follow a mass-size relation, similar to that followed by their stellar components. At the highest mass, the optical S\'ersic index of these SFGs increases to 2.5, suggesting the presence of a dominant stellar bulge. Because their star-forming components remain disk-like, these bulges cannot have formed by secular in-situ growth. We identify a second population of galaxies lying below the MIR mass-size relation, with compact star-forming components embedded in extended stellar components (EC galaxy). These galaxies are overall rare (15%) but become more dominant (30%) at high mass ($&gt;10^{10.5}M_\odot$). The compact star-forming components of these galaxies are also concentrated and slightly spheroidal, suggesting that this compaction phase can build dense bulge in-situ. Finally, we identify a third population of SFGs (19%), with both compact stellar and star-forming components. The density of their stellar cores resemble those of QGs and are compatible with being the descendants of EC galaxy. Overall, the structural evolution of SFGs is mainly dominated by a secular inside-out growth, which can, however, be interrupted by violent compaction phase(s) that can build dominant stellar bulges like those in massive SFGs or QGs.</description>

      <title>Single-epoch and Differential Astrometric Microlensing of Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and discuss a new experimental approach to measure the centroid shift induced by gravitational microlensing in the images of lensed quasars (astrometric microlensing). Our strategy is based on taking the photocenter of a region in the quasar large enough as to be insensitive to microlensing as reference to measure the centroid displacement of the continuum. In this way, single-epoch measurements of astrometric microlensing can be performed. Using numerical simulations, we show that, indeed, the centroid shift monotonically decreases as the size of the emitting region increases, and only for relatively large regions, like the broad line region (BLR), does the centroid shift become negligible. This opens interesting possibilities to study the stratification of the different emitters in the accretion disk and the BLR. We estimate the amplitude of the centroid shifts for 79 gravitationally lensed images and study more thoroughly the special cases Q2237+030 A, RXJ1131-1231 A, PG1115+080 A2 and SDSS J1004+4112 A. We propose to use spectro-astrometry to simultaneously obtain the photocenters of the continuum and of different emission line regions since, with the precision of forthcoming instruments, astrometric microlensing by $\sim 1 M_\odot$ mass microlenses may be detected in many quasar lensed images. When we consider more massive micro/millilenses, $M\gtrsim 10 M_\odot$, often proposed as the constituents of dark matter, the BLR becomes sensitive to microlensing and can no longer be used as a positional reference to measure centroid shifts. Differential microlensing between the images of a lensed quasar along several epochs should be used instead.</description>

      <title>Wide Area VISTA Extra-galactic Survey (WAVES): Unsupervised star-galaxy separation on the WAVES-Wide photometric input catalogue using UMAP and ${\rm{\scriptsize HDBSCAN}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-galaxy separation is a crucial step in creating target catalogues for extragalactic spectroscopic surveys. A classifier biased towards inclusivity risks including spurious stars, wasting fibre hours, while a more conservative classifier might overlook galaxies, compromising completeness and hence survey objectives. To avoid bias introduced by a training set in supervised methods, we employ an unsupervised machine learning approach. Using photometry from the Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey (WAVES)-Wide catalogue comprising 9-band $u-K_s$ data, we create a feature space with colours, fluxes, and apparent size information extracted by ${\rm P{\scriptsize RO} F{\scriptsize OUND}}$. We apply the non-linear dimensionality reduction method UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) combined with the classifier ${\rm{\scriptsize HDBSCAN}}$ to classify stars and galaxies. Our method is verified against a baseline colour and morphological method using a truth catalogue from Gaia, SDSS, GAMA, and DESI. We correctly identify 99.72% of galaxies within the AB magnitude limit of $Z = 21.2$, with an F1 score of 0.9970 across the entire ground truth sample, compared to 0.9871 from the baseline method. Our method's higher purity (0.9966) compared to the baseline (0.9780) increases efficiency, identifying 11% fewer galaxy or ambiguous sources, saving approximately 70,000 fibre hours on the 4MOST instrument. We achieve reliable classification statistics for challenging sources including quasars, compact galaxies, and low surface brightness galaxies, retrieving 95.1%, 84.6%, and 99.5% of them respectively. Angular clustering analysis validates our classifications, showing consistency with expected galaxy clustering, regardless of the baseline classification.</description>

      <title>Lopsided distribution of MATLAS and ELVES dwarf satellite systems around isolated host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of satellite dwarf galaxies pose important empirical constraints to verify cosmological models on galaxy scales. Their phase-space correlations, in particular, offer interesting insights into various models. Next to the planes-of-satellites phenomenon, the lopsided distribution of satellites relative to their host galaxy has been studied observationally and in cosmological simulations. It is still unclear how observed lopsidedness aligns with expectations from simulations. We measure lopsidedness in observed isolated satellite systems using six different metrics. We study 47 systems from the MATLAS survey beyond the Local Volume (LV) as well as 21 LV satellite systems from the ELVES survey. We find that the so-called wedge metric, counting the number of dwarfs in wedges with varying opening angles, is best suited to capture a system's overall lopsidedness. Under this metric, our analysis reveals that ~16 percent of the tested satellite systems exhibit a statistically significant degree of lopsidedness when compared to systems with randomly generated satellite position angles. This presents a notable excess over the expected 5% (2 sigma level) of significantly lopsided systems in a sample with no overall inherent lopsidedness. However, using multiple metrics provides a more complete picture. Combining all tested metrics, the number of significantly lopsided systems increases to ~21 percent. Contrary to recent results from the literature, we find more lopsided systems among the red early-type galaxies in the MATLAS survey compared to the mostly blue late-type hosts in ELVES. We further find that satellite galaxies at larger distances from the host, potentially recently accreted, are likely the primary contributors to the reported excess of lopsidedness. Our results enable comparisons with similar systems in simulations to assess consistency with the standard model.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of the physical parameters of galaxies from WEAVE-StePS-like data using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE) is a new, massively multiplexing spectrograph. This new instrument will be exploited to obtain high S/N spectra of $\sim$25000 galaxies at intermediate redshifts for the WEAVE Stellar Population Survey (WEAVE-StePS). We test machine learning methods for retrieving the key physical parameters of galaxies from WEAVE-StePS-like spectra using both photometric and spectroscopic information at various S/Ns and redshifts. We simulated $\sim$105000 galaxy spectra assuming SFH with an exponentially declining star formation rate, covering a wide range of ages, stellar metallicities, sSFRs, and dust extinctions. We then evaluated the ability of the random forest and KNN algorithms to correctly predict such parameters assuming no measurement errors. We checked how much the predictive ability deteriorates for different S/Ns and redshifts, finding that both algorithms still accurately estimate the ages and metallicities with low bias. The dispersion varies from 0.08-0.16 dex for ages and 0.11-0.25 dex for metallicity, depending on the redshift and S/N. For dust attenuation, we find a similarly low bias and dispersion. For the sSFR, we find a very good constraining power for star-forming galaxies, log sSFR$\gtrsim$ -11, where the bias is $\sim$ 0.01 dex and the dispersion is $\sim$ 0.10 dex. For more quiescent galaxies, with log sSFR$\lesssim$ -11, we find a higher bias, 0.61-0.86 dex, and a higher dispersion, $\sim$ 0.4 dex, for different S/Ns and redshifts. Generally, we find that the RF outperforms the KNN. Finally, the retrieved sSFR was used to successfully classify galaxies as part of the blue cloud, green valley, or red sequence. We demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can accurately estimate the physical parameters of simulated galaxies even at relatively low S/N=10 per angstrom spectra with available ancillary photometric information.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field in mini starburst complex Sgr B2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11800v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first arcsecond-resolution observations of the magnetic field in the mini starburst complex Sgr B2. SMA polarization observations revealed magnetic field morphology in three dense cores of Sgr B2 N(orth), M(ain), and S(outh). The total plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths in these cores are estimated to be 4.3-10.0 mG, 6.2-14.7 mG, and 1.9-4.5 mG derived from the angular dispersion function method after applying the correction factors of 0.21 and 0.5. Combining with analyses of the parsec-scale polarization data from SOFIA, we found that a magnetically supercritical condition is present from the cloud-scale ($\sim$10 pc) to core-scale ($\sim$0.2 pc) in Sgr B2, which is consistent with the burst of star formation activities in the region likely resulted from a multi-scale gravitational collapse from the cloud to dense cores.</description>

      <title>CANUCS: Constraining the MACS J0416.1-2403 Strong Lensing Model with JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec and NIRCam</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters has become an essential tool in astrophysics, allowing us to directly probe the dark matter distribution and study magnified background sources. The precision and reliability of strong lensing models rely heavily on the number and quality of multiple images of background sources with spectroscopic redshifts. We present an updated strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. We use the JWST 's NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model is constrained using Lenstool software. Our new dataset, used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images from 111 background sources and includes systems with previously known MUSE redshift and systems for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is &gt;20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The derived strong lensing model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of 0.53''. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. We furthermore demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST particularly NIRISS, for strong lensing studies. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII] {\lambda}3727, [OIII] {\lambda}{\lambda}4959, 5007, and H{\alpha} lines at 1&lt;z&lt;3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.</description>

      <title>Optical Variability Properties of Southern TESS Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of high-cadence, high-precision, optical light curves from the TESS satellite of 67 blazars in the southern sky. We provide descriptive flux statistics, power spectral density model parameters, and characteristic variability timescales. We find that only 15 BL Lacertae objects (BLLs) and 18 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) from the initial 26 and 41, respectively exhibit statistically-significant variability. We employ an adapted Power Spectral Response method to test the goodness of fit for the power spectral density function (PSD) to 3 power-law variant models. From our best-fitting description of the PSD, we extract the high-frequency power-spectral slopes and, if present, determine the significant bend or break in the model to identify characteristic timescales. We find no significant difference in the excess variance or rms-scatter between blazar subpopulations. We identify a linear rms-flux relation in ~69% of our sample, in which ~20% show a strong correlation. We find that both subpopulations of blazars show power spectral slope of $\alpha$~2 in which a broken power-law best fits 5 BLL &amp; 6 FSRQ and a bending power-law best fits 1 BLL &amp; 5 FSRQ. The shortest timescales of variability in each light curve range widely from minutes to weeks. Additionally, the objects' characteristic timescales range from ~0.8-8 days, consistent with the optical variability originating in the jet.</description>

      <title>Rotation and H$\alpha$ emission in a young SMC cluster: a spectroscopic view of NGC 330</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-resolution optical spectra recorded for 30 stars of the split extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) of the young ($\sim$ 40 Myr) Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) globular cluster NGC 330. Spectra were obtained with the M2FS and MIKE spectrographs located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5m telescope. These spectra revealed the presence of Be stars, occupying primarily the cool side of the split main sequence (MS). Rotational velocity ($v\sin{i}$) measurements for most of the targets are consistent with the presence of two populations of stars in the cluster: one made up of rapidly rotating Be stars ($&lt;v\sin{i}&gt; \approx 200$ $\rm km\,s^{-1}$), and {the other} consisting of warmer stars with slower rotation ($&lt;\!v\sin{i}\!&gt;\approx50$ $\rm km\,s^{-1}$). Core emission in the H$\delta$ photospheric lines was observed for most of the H$\alpha$ emitters. The shell parameter computed for the targets in our sample indicate that most of the observed stars should have inclinations below 75$^{\circ}$. These results confirm the detection of Be stars obtained through photometry, but also reveal the presence of narrow H$\alpha$ and H$\delta$ features for some targets that cannot be detected with low-resolution spectroscopy or photometry. Asymmetry variability of H$\alpha$ line profiles on the timescales of a few years is also observed, and could provide information on the geometry of the decretion disks. Observations revealed the presence of nebular H$\alpha$ emission, strong enough in faint targets to compromise the extraction of spectra and to impact narrow band photometry used to assess the presence of H$\alpha$ emission.</description>

      <title>Four microlensing giant planets detected through signals produced by minor-image perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the nature of the anomalies appearing in four microlensing events KMT-2020-BLG-0757, KMT-2022-BLG-0732, KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and KMT-2022-BLG-1852. The light curves of these events commonly exhibit initial bumps followed by subsequent troughs that extend across a substantial portion of the light curves. We performed thorough modeling of the anomalies to elucidate their characteristics. Despite their prolonged durations, which differ from the usual brief anomalies observed in typical planetary events, our analysis revealed that each anomaly in these events originated from a planetary companion located within the Einstein ring of the primary star. It was found that the initial bump arouse when the source star crossed one of the planetary caustics, while the subsequent trough feature occurred as the source traversed the region of minor image perturbations lying between the pair of planetary caustics. The estimated masses of the host and planet, their mass ratios, and the distance to the discovered planetary systems are $(M_{\rm host}/M_\odot, M_{\rm planet}/M_{\rm J}, q/10^{-3}, \dl/{\rm kpc}) = (0.58^{+0.33}_{-0.30}, 10.71^{+6.17}_{-5.61}, 17.61\pm 2.25,6.67^{+0.93}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2020-BLG-0757, $(0.53^{+0.31}_{-0.31}, 1.12^{+0.65}_{-0.65}, 2.01 \pm 0.07, 6.66^{+1.19}_{-1.84})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-0732, $(0.42^{+0.32}_{-0.23}, 6.64^{+4.98}_{-3.64}, 15.07\pm 0.86, 7.55^{+0.89}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and $(0.32^{+0.34}_{-0.19}, 4.98^{+5.42}_{-2.94}, 8.74\pm 0.49, 6.27^{+0.90}_{-1.15})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1852. These parameters indicate that all the planets are giants with masses exceeding the mass of Jupiter in our solar system and the hosts are low-mass stars with masses substantially less massive than the Sun.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamical modeling of star-disk formation: from isolated spherical collapse towards incorporation of external dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of protostars and their disks has been understood as the result of the gravitational collapse phase of an accumulation of dense gas that determines the mass reservoir of the star-disk system. Against this background, the broadly applied scenario of considering the formation of disks has been to model the collapse of a dense core assuming spherical spherical symmetry. Our understanding of the formation of star-disk systems is currently undergoing a reformation though. The picture evolves from interpreting disks as the sole outcome of the collapse of an isolated prestellar core to a more dynamic picture where disks are affected by the molecular cloud environment in which they form. In this review, we provide a status report of the state-of-the-art of spherical collapse models that are highly advanced in terms of the incorporated physics together with constraints from models that account for the possibility of infall onto star-disk systems in simplified test setups, as well as in multi-scale simulations that cover a dynamical range from the Giant Molecular Cloud environment down to the disk. Considering the observational constraints that favor a more dynamical picture of star formation, we finally discuss the challenges and prospects in linking the efforts of tackle the problem of star-disk formation in combined multi-scale, multi-physics simulations.</description>

      <title>The dependence of halo bias on the protohalo shape alignment with the initial tidal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical evidence supporting the primordial origin of secondary halo bias even on the galactic mass scale. Analyzing the data from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulations, we investigate the dependence of halo bias on the degree of misalignment between the protohalo inertia and initial tidal tensors, $\tau$, measured at redshift, $z_{i}=127$. From the TNG 300-1 galactic halos in logarithmic mass range of $10.5&lt; m\equiv \log[M/(h^{-1}M_{\odot})]\le 13$ identified at $z=0,\ 0.5$ and $1$, a clear signal of $\tau$ bias is detected. For the case that $\tau$ is measured from the initial tidal field smoothed on the scale of $R_{f}/(h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})\lesssim 1$, the halo $\tau$ bias is found to be very similar in its tendency and amplitude to the spin bias at all of the three redshifts, if the effects of backsplash halos are properly eliminated. For the case of $R_{f}/(h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})=2$, the $\tau$ bias at $z=1$ turns out to behave like the age bias, diminishing rapidly in the range of $m&gt; 12$. At $z=0$ and $0.5$, however, the $\tau$ and age bias factors show large differences in their overall strengths, which is attributed to the dominant nonlinear effects that undermine the former but enhance the latter. Given these numerical results along with the previous finding that $\tau$ shares a large amount of mutual information with the formation epochs and spin parameters of galactic halos, it is concluded that the origins of halo age and spin bias must be closely linked with the primordial factor, $\tau$, and that the difference in the tendency between the two bias factors on the galactic mass scale reflects the multi-scale influence of $\tau$ on the halo secondary properties.</description>

      <title>A Kinematic Analysis of the Giant Molecular Complex W3; Possible Evidence for Cloud-Cloud Collisions that Triggered OB Star Clusters in W3 Main and W3(OH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02217</link>

Abstract: W3 is one of the most outstanding regions of high-mass star formation in the outer solar circle, including two active star-forming clouds, W3 Main and W3(OH). Based on a new analysis of the $^{12}$CO data obtained at 38$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, we have found three clouds having molecular mass from 2000 to 8000~$M_\odot$ at velocities, $-50$~km s$^{-1}$, $-43$~km s$^{-1}$, and $-39$~km s$^{-1}$. The $-43$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud is the most massive one, overlapping with the $-39$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud and the $-50$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud toward W3 Main and W3(OH), respectively. In W3 Main and W3(OH), we have found typical signatures of a cloud-cloud collision, i.e., the complementary distribution with/without a displacement between the two clouds and/or a V-shape in the position-velocity diagram. We frame a hypothesis that a cloud-cloud collision triggered the high-mass star formation in each region. The collision in W3 Main involves the $-39$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud and the $-43$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud. The collision likely produced a cavity in the $-43$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud having a size similar to the $-39$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud and triggered the formation of young high-mass stars in IC~1795 2 Myr ago. We suggest that the $-39$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud is still triggering the high-mass objects younger than 1 Myr embedded in W3 Main currently. On the other hand, another collision between the $-50$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud and the $-43$~km s$^{-1}$ cloud likely formed the heavily embedded objects in W3(OH) within $\sim$0.5 Myr ago. The present results favour an idea that cloud-cloud collisions are common phenomena not only in the inner solar circle but also in the outer solar circle, where the number of reported cloud-cloud collisions is yet limited (Fukui et al. 2021, PASJ, 73, S1).</description>

Abstract: Probing magnetic fields in astrophysical environments is both important and challenging. The Gradient Technique (GT) is a new tool for tracing magnetic fields, rooted in the properties of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and turbulent magnetic reconnection. In this work, we examine the performance of GT when applied to synthetic synchrotron emission and spectroscopic data obtained from sub-Alfv\'enic and trans-Alfv\'enic MHD simulations. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of GT in tracing magnetic fields in the absence of low-spatial frequencies. Additionally, we apply a low-spatial frequency filter to a diffuse neutral hydrogen region selected from the GALFA-\ion{H}{1} survey. Our results show an increased alignment between the magnetic fields inferred from GT and the Planck 353 GHz polarization measurements.</description>

      <title>A New Measurement of the Mean Transmitted Flux in the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new measurements of the mean transmitted flux in the hydrogen Ly$\rm \alpha$ and a relative transmitted flux measurement in Ly$\rm \beta$ using 27,008 quasar spectra from the Fourteenth Data Release (DR14) of the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). Individual spectra are first combined into 16 composites with mean redshifts in the range of $2.8&lt;z&lt;4.9$. We then apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference to produce a piecewise fit of the effective $\tau_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}$ (corrected for metal lines and optically thick absorption) assuming a spline point distribution. We also perform a relative $\Delta \tau_{\rm{Ly\beta}}$ measurement with the same data set, finding $\Delta \tau_{\rm{Ly\beta}}&lt;0.35$ at $z&lt;4.8$. The 6-8 $\%$ precision measurements in the rest frame 1075-1150 {\AA} at $\it{z} \ &lt; \rm{4.0}$ and 10-12 $\%$ precision measurements in the same region at $\it{z} \ &gt; \rm{4.0}$ on $\tau_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}$, and our determinations of $\Delta \tau_{\rm{Ly\beta}}$, are dominated by systematic errors, likely arising from bias and uncertainties in estimates of the quasar continuum. Our $\tau_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}$ values show a smooth increase by a factor of 5 over the redshift range $z=2.4-4.4$.</description>

      <title>FASHI: A search for extragalactic OH megamasers with FAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FAST All Sky HI survey (FASHI) is broader in frequency band and sky volume, and deeper in detection sensitivity than the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey (ALFALFA). To efficiently expand the sample of OH megamasers (OHMs), whose strongest line has a rest frequency of 1667.35903 MHz, we directly matched the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift (PSCz) catalog with the corresponding FASHI data cube. From 145 PSCz sources already covered by FASHI, we obtained 27 OHMs with a detection rate of 18.6%, including 9 previously known and 18 new ones, within a redshift range of $0.14314\lesssim z_{\rm OH} \lesssim0.27656$. We also measured the hyperfine ratio of nine OHMs between the 1667 and 1665 MHz lines. The ratio ranges from 1.32 to 15.22, with an average of $R_{1667:1665}=4.74$. In a fit to the $L_{\rm OH}$ vs. $L_{\rm FIR}$ relation, we have ${\rm log}L_{\rm OH}= (1.57\pm0.10){\rm log}L_{\rm FIR}-(15.80\pm1.19)$, which is almost the same as derived from previous observations. As expected, since the OHM sample was selected by cross-correlation with the IRAS-selected PSCz, our detected OHMs are [ultra]luminous infrared galaxies ([U]LIRGs). However, not all [U]LIRGs have detectable OH emission, suggesting that the OH emission may be triggered within a specific stage of the merger or can only be seen in specific orientations. In general, FAST, with its 19-beam array and UWB receiver, will be a powerful tool for observing more OHMs and unraveling their mystery in the future.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx 6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\gtrsim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterisation of the extinction properties of NGC 3603 using JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. A necessary ingredient in understanding the star formation history of a young cluster is knowledge of the extinction towards the region. This has typically been done by making use of the colour-difference method with photometry, or similar methods utilising the colour-colour diagram. Aims. The colour-excess can be independently determined by studying the decrements of the recombination lines produced by the nebular gas. Having access to many recombination lines from the same spectral series removes the need of adopting an extinction curve. Methods. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) on board the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 600 nebular spectra from the Galactic massive star formation region NGC 3603. The recombination line intensity ratios were used to determine independent values of colour-excess. Results. The extinction characteristics of NGC 3603 are similar to other Galactic HII regions like Orion, as well as starburst regions such 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, in that we find a relatively large value of total-to-selective extinction of 4.8 $\pm$ 1.06, larger than the Galactic average of 3.1. We find a typical value for the colour-excess of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.27, significantly lower than values determined in previous studies. We also present a stacked nebular spectrum with a typical continuum S/N = 70. This spectrum highlights the recombination lines of the HII region, several s-process elements such as Kr III and Se IV, and molecular H2 emission lines. Conclusions. Using ratios of hydrogen recombination lines, we calculated the total-to-selective extinction, colour-excess and visual extinction for &gt; 200 lines of sight across NGC 3603. An extinction curve with a total-to-selective extinction of 4.8 $\pm$ 1.06 was found, corresponding to a colour-excess of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.27.</description>

      <title>A hot core in the group-dominant elliptical galaxy NGC 777</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 777 provides an example of a phenomenon observed in some group-central ellipticals, in which the temperature profile shows a central peak, despite the short central cooling time of the intra-group medium. We use deep Chandra X-ray observations of the galaxy, supported by uGMRT 400 MHz radio imaging, to investigate the origin of this hot core. We confirm the centrally-peaked temperature profile and find that entropy and cooling time both monotonically decline to low values (2.62 [+0.19, -0.18] keV cm$^2$ and 71.3 [+12.8, -13.1] Myr) in the central ~700 pc. Faint diffuse radio emission surrounds the nuclear point source, with no clear jets or lobes but extending to ~10 kpc on a northwest-southeast axis. This alignment and extent agree well with a previously identified filamentary H$\alpha$+[NII] nebula. While cavities are not firmly detected, we see X-ray surface brightness decrements on the same axis at 10-20 kpc radius which are consistent with the intra-group medium having been pushed aside by expanding radio lobes. Any such outburst must have occurred long enough ago for lobe emission to have faded below detectability. Cavities on this scale would be capable of balancing radiative cooling for at least ~240 Myr. We consider possible causes of the centrally peaked temperature profile, including gravitational heating of gas as the halo relaxes after a period of AGN jet activity, and heating by particles leaking from the remnant relativistic plasma of the old radio jets.</description>

      <title>UVIT Study of the MAgellanic Clouds (U-SMAC) I. Recent star formation history and kinematics of the Shell region in the North-Eastern Small Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interactions between the Magellanic Clouds significantly affect the shape and distribution of the young stellar population, particularly in the periphery of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We present the first far-UV (FUV) map of the north-east SMC-Shell region using the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. The detected FUV stars are combined with Gaia Early Data Release 3 data to create a FUV-optical catalog of ~ 14,400 stars. FUV-optical colour-magnitude diagrams are used along with isochrones to estimate the stellar ages. The detected stars are formed in multiple episodes. We identified two episodes of star formation (~ 60 and ~ 260 Myr ago) where the episode at ~ 260 Myr is linked to the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the episode at ~ 60 Myr is linked to the pericentric passage of the SMC around our Galaxy. The median proper motion (PM) and velocity dispersion are found to be similar to the SMC main body, indicating that this region has not experienced significant tidal effects. The FUV stellar surface density and the dispersion in PM suggest an extent of the inner SMC in the north-east direction to be around 2.2 deg. We detect arm-like and arc-like structures in the FUV stellar density map, and their kinematics appear to be similar to the SMC main body. These extended outer features are the spatial stellar overdensities formed over multiple episodes of star formation, but without apparent kinematic distinction.</description>

      <title>Detection of New Galaxy Candidates at $z\ &gt;$ 11 in the JADES Field Using JWST NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of seven new galaxy candidates with redshift $z$ $&gt;$ 11 within the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. These new candidates are detected through meticulous analysis of NIRCam photometry in eight filters spanning a wavelength range of 0.8-5.0 $\mu$m. Photometric redshifts of these galaxy candidates are independently measured utilizing spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques using \texttt{EAZY} and \texttt{BAGPIPES} codes, followed by visual scrutiny. Two of these galaxy candidates are located in GOODS-S field, while the remaining five galaxies are located in GOODS-N field. Our analysis reveals that the stellar masses of these galaxies typically range from log $M_{\ast}$/$M_{\odot}$ = 7.75--8.75. Futhermore, these galaxies are typically young with their mass-weighted ages spanning from 80 to 240 Myr. Their specific star formation rates (sSFR), quantified as $\log (\text{sSFR}/\text{Gyr}$), are measured to vary between $\sim 0.95$ to 1.46. These new galaxy candidates offer a robust sample for probing the physical properties of galaxies within the first few hundred Myr of the history of the Universe. We also analyze the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_\ast$) within our sample. Using linear regression, our analysis yields a slope of $0.71 \pm 0.12$, which we then compare with results from previous studies. Continued investigation through spectroscopic analysis using JWST/NIRSpec is needed to spectroscopically confirm these high-redshift galaxy candidates and investigate further into their physical properties. We plan to follow up on these candidates with future NIRSpec observations.</description>

      <title>Detection of Open Cluster Members Inside and Beyond Tidal Radius by Machine Learning Methods Based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced a method that combines two unsupervised algorithms: DBSCAN and GMM. We applied this method to 12 open clusters based on Gaia EDR3 data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying reliable cluster members within the tidal radius. However, for studying cluster morphology, we need a method capable of detecting members both inside and outside the tidal radius. By incorporating a supervised algorithm into our approach, we successfully identified members beyond the tidal radius. In our current work, we initially applied DBSCAN and GMM to identify reliable members of cluster stars. Subsequently, we trained the Random Forest algorithm using DBSCAN and GMM-selected data. Leveraging the random forest, we can identify cluster members outside the tidal radius and observe cluster morphology across a wide field of view. Our method was then applied to 15 open clusters based on Gaia DR3, which exhibit a wide range of metallicity, distances, members, and ages. Additionally, we calculated the tidal radius for each of the 15 clusters using the King profile and detected stars both inside and outside this radius. Finally, we investigated mass segregation and luminosity distribution within the clusters. Overall, our approach significantly improved the estimation of the tidal radius and detection of mass segregation compared to previous work. We found that in Collinder 463, low-mass stars do not segregate in comparison to high-mass and middle-mass stars. Additionally, we detected a peak of luminosity in the clusters, some of which were located far from the center, beyond the tidal radius.</description>

      <title>Structure formation in large-volume cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter: Impact of the non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.01828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultra-light bosonic particle of mass around $10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ is of special interest as a dark matter candidate, as it both has particle physics motivations, and may give rise to notable differences in the structures on highly non-linear scales due to the manifestation of quantum-physical wave effects on macroscopic scales, which could address a number of contentious small-scale tensions in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using a spectral technique, we here discuss simulations of such fuzzy dark matter (FDM), including the full non-linear wave dynamics, with a comparatively large dynamic range and for larger box sizes than considered previously. While the impact of suppressed small-scale power in the initial conditions associated with FDM has been studied before, the characteristic FDM dynamics are often neglected; in our simulations, we instead show the impact of the full non-linear dynamics on physical observables. We focus on the evolution of the matter power spectrum, give first results for the FDM halo mass function directly based on full FDM simulations, and discuss the computational challenges associated with the FDM equations. FDM shows a pronounced suppression of power on small scales relative to cold dark matter (CDM), which can be understood as a damping effect due to 'quantum pressure'. In certain regimes, however, the FDM power can exceed that of CDM, which may be interpreted as a reflection of order-unity density fluctuations occurring in FDM. In the halo mass function, FDM shows a significant abundance reduction below a characteristic mass scale only. This could in principle alleviate the need to invoke very strong feedback processes in small galaxies to reconcile $\Lambda$CDM with the observed galaxy luminosity function, but detailed studies that also include baryons will be needed to ultimately judge the viability of FDM.</description>

      <title>CONGRuENTS (COsmic-ray, Neutrino, Gamma-ray and Radio Non-Thermal Spectra). II. Population-level correlations between galactic infrared, radio, and {\gamma}-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxies obey a number of empirical correlations between their radio, {\gamma}-ray, and infrared emission, but the physical origins of these correlations remain uncertain. Here we use the CONGRuENTS model for broadband non-thermal emission from star-forming galaxies, which self-consistently calculates energy-dependent transport and non-thermal emission from cosmic ray hadrons and leptons, to predict radio and {\gamma}-ray emission for a synthetic galaxy population with properties drawn from a large deep-field survey. We show that our synthetic galaxies reproduce observed relations such as the FIR-radio correlation, the FIR-{\gamma} correlation, and the distribution of radio spectral indices, and we use the model to explain the physical origins of these relations. Our results show that the FIR-radio correlation arises because the amount of cosmic ray electron power ultimately radiated as synchrotron emission varies only weakly with galaxy star formation rate as a result of the constraints imposed on gas properties by hydrostatic balance and turbulent dynamo action; the same physics dictates the extent of proton calorimetry in different galaxies, and thus sets the FIR-{\gamma}-ray correlation. We further show that galactic radio spectral indices result primarily from competition between thermal free-free emission and energy-dependent loss of cosmic ray electrons to bremsstrahlung and escape into galactic halos, with shaping of the spectrum by inverse Compton, synchrotron, and ionisation processes typically playing a sub-dominant role. In addition to explaining existing observations, we use our analysis to predict a heretofore unseen correlation between the curvature of galaxies' radio spectra and their pion-driven {\gamma}-ray emission, a prediction that will be testable with upcoming facilities.</description>

      <title>Very Local Impact on the Spectrum of Cosmic-Ray Nuclei below 100 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of primary and secondary CR spectra, their arrival directions, and our improved knowledge of the magnetic field geometry around the heliosphere allow us to set a bound on the distance beyond which a puzzling 10-TeV ``bump'' and certain related spectral features \emph{cannot} originate. The sharpness of the spectral breaks associated with the bump, the abrupt change of the CR intensity across the local magnetic equator ($90^{\circ}$ pitch angle), and the similarity between the primary and secondary CR spectral patterns point to a local reacceleration of the bump particles out of the background CRs. We argue that, owing to a steep preexisting CR spectrum, a nearby shock may generate such a bump by boosting particle rigidity by a mere factor of $\sim$1.5 in the range below 50 TV. Reaccelerated particles below $\sim$0.5 TV are convected with the interstellar medium flow and do not reach the Sun. The particles above this rigidity then form the bump. This single universal process is responsible for the observed spectral features of all CR nuclei, primary and secondary, in the rigidity range below 100 TV. We propose that one viable candidate is the system of shocks associated with $\epsilon$ Eridani star at 3.2 pc of the Sun, which is well aligned with the direction of the local magnetic field. Other shocks, such as old supernova shells, may produce a similar effect. We provide a simple formula that reproduces the spectra of all CR species with only three parameters uniquely derived from the CR proton data. We show how our formalism predicts helium, boron, carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra. Our model thus unifies all the CR spectral features observed below 50 TV.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T Tauri stars with UVIT/AstroSat: probing accretion process in young stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T-Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus molecular cloud with UVIT/AstroSat. This is the very first UVIT study of TTSs. From the spectral energy distribution of TTSs from FUV to near-IR, we show that classical TTSs (CTTSs) emit significantly higher UV excess compared to weak-line TTSs (WTTSs). The equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to the UV excess in CTTSs ($&gt;10^4$ K) are also found to be relatively higher than that in WTTSs ($&lt;9250$ K). From the UV excess, we have re-classified two WTTSs (BS Tau, V836 Tau) as CTTSs, which has been supported by the follow-up optical spectroscopic study using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), showing strong H$\alpha$ line emission. We find that CTTSs show strong excess emission in both FUV ($&gt;$10$^7$) and NUV ($&gt;$10$^3$) bands, while WTTSs show strong excess only in the FUV ($\lesssim$10$^5$), suggesting that excess emission in NUV can be used as a tool to classify the TTSs. We also find a linear correlation between UV luminosity (a primary indicator of mass accretion) and H$\alpha$ luminosity (a secondary indicator of mass accretion) with a slope of 1.20$\pm$0.22 and intercept of 2.16$\pm$0.70.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XI. No increase of mass-loss rates over the bistability region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of blue supergiants are key for constraining the end of the main sequence (MS) of massive stars. Whether the observed drop in the relative number of fast-rotating stars below $\sim$21$\,$kK is due to enhanced mass-loss rates at the location of the bistability jump, or the result of the end of the MS is still debated. Here, we combine newly derived estimates of photospheric and wind parameters with Gaia distances and wind terminal velocities from the literature to obtain upper limits on the mass-loss rates for a sample of 116 Galactic luminous blue supergiants. The parameter space covered by the sample ranges between 35-15$\,$kK in $T_{\rm eff}$ and 4.8-5.8$\,$dex in log(L/L$_{\odot}$). Our results show no increase in the mass-loss rates over the bistability jump. Therefore, we argue that the drop in rotational velocities cannot be explained by enhanced mass loss. Since a large jump in the mass-loss rates is commonly included in evolutionary models, we suggest an urgent revision of the currently used default prescriptions.</description>

      <title>M17 MIR: A Massive Star is Forming via Episodic Mass Accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyzed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6 data for the outbursting massive protostar M17~MIR. The ALMA CO $J=2-1$ data reveal a collimated and bipolar north-south outflow from M17~MIR. The blue-shifted outflow exhibits four CO knots (N1 to N4) along the outflow axis, while the red-shifted outflow appears as a single knot (S1). The extremely high velocity (EHV) emissions of N1 and S1 are jet-like and contain sub-knots along the outflow axis. Assuming the nearest EHV sub-knots trace the ejecta from the accretion outbursts in the past decades, a tangential ejection velocity of $\sim421\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ is derived for M17~MIR. Assuming the same velocity, the dynamical times of the multiple ejecta, traced by the four blue-shifted CO knots, range from 20 to 364 years. The four blue-shifted CO knots imply four clustered accretion outbursts with a duration of tens of years in the past few hundred years. The intervals between the four clustered accretion outbursts are also about tens of years. These properties of the four clustered accretion outbursts are in line with the disk gravitational instability and fragmentation model. The episodic accretion history of M17~MIR traced by episodic outflow suggests that a massive star can form from a lower-mass protostar via frequent episodic accretion events triggered by disk gravitational instability and fragmentation. The first detection of the knotty outflow from an outbursting massive protostar suggests that mass ejections accompanied with accretion events could serve as an effective diagnostic tool for the episodic accretion histories of massive protostars.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological coupling of spherical, local astrophysical systems. We derive a general formula quantifying the cosmological coupling of the Misner-Sharp mass of these objects. We show that, in the weak-field limit, the cosmological coupling is only allowed if there are pressure anisotropies. We also apply our results to galaxies, modelling them with the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles. We show that the galactic mass can be coupled to the cosmological dynamics and examine its dependence on the scale factor of the universe.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results III. Implications for cosmic molecular gas content at "Cosmic Half-past Eleven"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at $z\sim3$ to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at $\langle{Tb}\rangle&lt;4.8$ $\mu$K. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo-CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.</description>
