      <title>Equivariant Witt Complexes and Twisted Topological Hochschild Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological Hochschild homology of a ring (or ring spectrum) $R$ is an $S^1$-spectrum, and the fixed points of THH($R$) for subgroups $C_n\subset S^1$ have been widely studied due to their use in algebraic K-theory computations. Hesselholt and Madsen proved that the fixed points of topological Hochschild homology are closely related to Witt vectors. Further, they defined the notion of a Witt complex, and showed that it captures the algebraic structure of the homotopy groups of the fixed points of THH. Recent work of Angeltveit, Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson and Mandell defines a theory of twisted topological Hochschild homology for equivariant rings (or ring spectra) that builds upon Hill, Hopkins and Ravenel's work on equivariant norms. In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of the equivariant homotopy groups of twisted THH. In particular, we define an equivariant Witt complex and prove that the equivariant homotopy of twisted THH has this structure. Our definition of equivariant Witt complexes contributes to a growing body of research in the subject of equivariant algebra.</description>

      <title>Computing the homology of universal covers via effective homology and discrete vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective homology techniques allow us to compute homology groups of a wide family of topological spaces. By the Whitehead tower method, this can also be used to compute higher homotopy groups. However, some of these techniques (in particular, the Whitehead tower) rely on the assumption that the starting space is simply connected. For some applications, this problem could be circumvented by replacing the space by its universal cover, which is a simply connected space that shares the higher homotopy groups of the initial space. In this paper, we formalize a simplicial construction for the universal cover, and represent it as a twisted cartesian product.
  As we show with some examples, the universal cover of a space with effective homology does not necessarily have effective homology in general. We show two independent sufficient conditions that can ensure it: one is based on a nilpotency property of the fundamental group, and the other one on discrete vector fields.
  Some examples showing our implementation of these constructions in both \sagemath\ and \kenzo\ are shown, together with an approach to compute the homology of the universal cover when the group is abelian even in some cases where there is no effective homology, using the twisted homology of the space.</description>

      <title>A note on invariants of foliated 3-sphere bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we prove that $H^*(\text{BSO}(4);\mathbb{Q})$ injects into the group cohomology of $\text{Diff}^+(S^{3})$ with rational coefficients. The proof is based on an idea of Nariman who proved that the monomials in the Euler and Pontrjagin classes are nontrivial in $H^*(\text{BDiff}_+^{\delta}(S^{2n-1});\mathbb{Q})$.</description>

      <title>Geometric representation of cohomology classes for the Lie groups Spin(7) and Spin(8)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By constructing concrete complex-oriented maps we show that the eight-fold of the generator of the third integral cohomology of the spin groups Spin(7) and Spin(8) is in the image of the Thom morphism from complex cobordism to singular cohomology, while the generator itself is not in the image. We thereby give a geometric construction for a nontrivial class in the kernel of the differential Thom morphism of Hopkins and Singer for the Lie groups Spin(7) and Spin(8). The construction exploits the special symmetries of the octonions.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality for simplicial restricted Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{s}_0\mathsf{Lie}^r$ be the category of $0$-reduced simplicial restricted Lie algebras over a fixed perfect field of positive characteristic $p$. We prove that there is a full subcategory $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{s}_0\mathsf{Lie}^r_{\xi})$ of the homotopy category $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{s}_0\mathsf{Lie}^r)$ and an equivalence $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{s}_0\mathsf{Lie}^r_{\xi})\simeq\mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{s}_1\mathsf{CoAlg}^{tr})$. Here $\mathsf{s}_1\mathsf{CoAlg}^{tr}$ is the category of $1$-reduced simplicial truncated coalgebras; informally, a coaugmented cocommutative coalgebra $C$ is truncated if $x^p=0$ for any $x$ from the augmentation ideal of the dual algebra $C^*$. Moreover, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition in terms of the homotopy groups $\pi_*(L_\bullet)$ for $L_\bullet \in \mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{s}_0\mathsf{Lie}^r)$ to lie in the full subcategory $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{s}_0\mathsf{Lie}^r_{\xi})$.
  As an application of the equivalence above, we construct and examine an analog of the unstable Adams spectral sequence of A. K. Bousfield and D. Kan in the category $\mathsf{s}\mathsf{Lie}^r$. We use this spectral sequence to recompute the homotopy groups of a free simplicial restricted Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Topological Frobenius algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notions of unital/counital/biunital infinitesimal anti-symmetric bialgebras and coFrobenius bialgebras and discuss their algebraic properties. We also define the notion of a graded 2D open-closed TQFT. These structures arise in Rabinowitz Floer homology, loop space homology, quantum homology, and the homology of finite dimensional manifolds. The underlying vector spaces, which are typically infinite dimensional, belong to a class of topological vector spaces known as Tate vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02973v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bouc first studied the topological properties of the matching complex of the complete graph of order $n$, denoted by $M_n$, in connection with Brown complexes and Quillen complexes. Later Bj\"{o}rner et al. showed that $M_n$ is homotopically $(\nu_n-1)$-connected, where $\nu_n=\lfloor{\frac{n+1}{3}}\rfloor-1$, and conjectured that this connectivity bound is sharp. Shareshian and Wachs settled the conjecture by inductively showing that the $\nu_n$-dimensional homology group of $M_n$ is nontrivial, with Bouc's calculation $H_1(M_7)$ serving as the pivotal base step. In general, the topology of $M_n$ is not very well-understood, even for a small $n$. In the present article, we look into the topology of $M_n$, and $M_7$ in particular, in the light of discrete Morse theory as developed by Forman. We first construct a gradient vector field on $M_n$ (for $n \ge 5$) that doesn't admit any critical simplices of dimension up to $\nu_n-1$, except one unavoidable $0$-simplex, which also leads to the aforementioned $(\nu_n-1)$-connectedness of $M_n$ in a purely combinatorial way. However, for an efficient homology computation by discrete Morse theoretic techniques, we are required to work with a gradient vector field that admits a low number of critical simplices, and also allows an efficient enumeration of gradient paths. An optimal gradient vector field is one with the least number of critical simplices, but the problem of finding an optimal gradient vector field, in general, is an NP-hard problem (even for $2$-dimensional complexes). We improve the gradient vector field constructed on $M_7$ in particular to a much more efficient (near-optimal) one, and then with the help of this improved gradient vector field, compute the homology groups of $M_7$ in an efficient and algorithmic manner. We also augment this near-optimal gradient vector field to one that we conjecture to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Morse homology with DG coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Morse homology and cohomology with coefficients in a derived local system, for manifolds and also more generally for colimits of spaces that have the homotopy type of manifolds, with a view towards Floer theory. The model that we adopt for derived, or differential graded (DG) local systems is that of DG modules over chains on the based loop space of a manifold. These encompass both classical (non DG) local systems and chains on fibers of Hurewicz fibrations. We prove that the Morse homology and cohomology groups that we construct are isomorphic to DG Tor and Ext functors. The key ingredient in the definition is a notion of twisting cocycle obtained by evaluating into based loops a coherent system of representatives for the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Morse trajectories of arbitrary dimensions. From this perspective, our construction sits midway between classical Morse homology with twisted coefficients and more refined invariants of Floer homotopical flavor. The construction of the twisting cocycle is originally due to Barraud and Cornea with Z/2-coefficients. We show that the twisting cocycle with integer coefficients is equivalent to Brown's universal twisting cocycle. We prove that Morse homology with coefficients in chains on the fiber of a Hurewicz fibration recovers the homology of the total space of the fibration. We study several structural properties of the theory: invariance, functoriality, and Poincar\'e duality, also in the nonorientable case.</description>
