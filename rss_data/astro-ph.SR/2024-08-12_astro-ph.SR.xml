      <title>Younger age for the oldest magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficiently old white dwarfs cool down through a convective envelope that directly couples their degenerate cores to the surface. Magnetic fields may inhibit this convection by stiffening the criterion for convective instability. We consistently implemented the modified criterion in the stellar evolution code MESA, and computed the cooling of white dwarfs as a function of their mass and magnetic field $B$. In contrast to previous estimates, we find that magnetic fields can significantly change the cooling time $t$ even if they are relatively weak $B^2\ll 8\pi P$, where $P$ is the pressure at the edge of the degenerate core. Fields $B\gtrsim 1\textrm{ MG}$ open a radiative window that decouples the core from the convective envelope, effectively lowering the luminosity to that of a fully radiative white dwarf. We identified a population of observed white dwarfs that are younger by $\Delta t\sim\textrm{Gyr}$ than currently thought due to this magnetic inhibition of convection - comparable to the cooling delay due to carbon-oxygen phase separation. In volume-limited samples, the frequency and strength of magnetic fields increase with age. Accounting for magnetic inhibition is therefore essential for accurate cooling models for cosmic chronology and for determining the origin of the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Extreme heating of minor ions in imbalanced solar-wind turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minor ions in the solar corona are heated to extreme temperatures, far in excess of those of the electrons and protons that comprise the bulk of the plasma. These highly non-thermal distributions make minor ions sensitive probes of the underlying collisionless heating processes, which are crucial to coronal heating and the creation of the solar wind. The recent discovery of the "helicity barrier" offers a mechanism where imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in low-beta plasmas preferentially heats protons over electrons, generating high-frequency, proton-cyclotron-resonant fluctuations. We use the hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell code, Pegasus++, to drive imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in a 3D low-beta plasma with additional passive ion species, He$^{2+}$ and O$^{5+}$. A helicity barrier naturally develops, followed by clear phase-space signatures of oblique ion-cyclotron-wave heating and Landau-resonant heating from the imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations. The former results in characteristically arced ion velocity distribution functions, whose non-bi-Maxwellian features are shown by linear ALPS calculations to be critical to the heating process. Additional features include a steep transition-range electromagnetic spectrum, the presence of ion-cyclotron waves propagating in the direction of imbalance, significantly enhanced proton-to-electron heating ratios, anisotropic ion temperatures that are significantly more perpendicular with respect to magnetic field, and extreme heating of heavier species in a manner consistent with empirically derived mass scalings informed by measurements. None of these features are realized in an otherwise equivalent simulation of balanced turbulence. If seen simultaneously in the fast solar wind, these signatures of the helicity barrier would testify to the necessity of incorporating turbulence imbalance in a complete theory for the evolution of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Electron Influence on the Parallel Proton Firehose Instability in 10-Moment, Multi-Fluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities driven by pressure anisotropy play a critical role in modulating the energy transfer in space and astrophysical plasmas. For the first time, we simulate the evolution and saturation of the parallel proton firehose instability using a multi-fluid model without adding artificial viscosity. These simulations are performed using a 10-moment, multi-fluid model with local and gradient relaxation heat-flux closures in high-$\beta$ proton-electron plasmas. When these higher-order moments are included and pressure anisotropy is permitted to develop in all species, we find that the electrons have a significant impact on the saturation of the parallel proton firehose instability, modulating the proton pressure anisotropy as the instability saturates. Even for lower $\beta$s more relevant to heliospheric plasmas, we observe a pronounced electron energization in simulations using the gradient relaxation closure. Our results indicate that resolving the electron pressure anisotropy is important to correctly describe the behavior of multi-species plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Solar poloidal magnetic field generation rate from observations and mean-field dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To estimate the hemispheric flux generation rate of the large-scale radial magnetic field in the Solar Cycles 23 and 24, we use the photospheric observations of the solar magnetic fields and results of the mean-field dynamo models. Results of the dynamo model show the strong impact of the radial turbulent diffusion on the surface evolution of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field and on the hemispheric magnetic flux generation rate. To process the observational data set we employ the parameters of the meridional circulation and turbulent diffusion from the Surface Flux-Transport (SFT) models. We find that the observed evolution of the axisymmetric vector potential contains the time--latitude patterns which can result from the effect of turbulent diffusion of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field in the radial direction. We think that, the SFT models can reconcile the observed rate of hemispheric magnetic flux generation by considering radial turbulent diffusion and lower values of the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Detecting quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares with a neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) are often detected in solar and stellar flare lightcurves. These events may contain valuable information about the underlying fundamental plasma dynamics as they are not described by the standard flare model. The detection of QPP signals in flare lightcurves is hindered by their intrinsically non-stationary nature, contamination by noise, and the continuously increasing amount of flare observations. Hence, the creation of automated techniques for QPP detection is imperative. We implemented the Fully Convolution Network (FCN) architecture to classify the flare lightcurves whether they have exponentially decaying harmonic QPP or not. To train the FCN, 90,000 synthetic flare lightcurves with and without QPP were generated. After training, it showed an accuracy of 87.2% on the synthetic test data and did not experience overfitting. To test the FCN performance on real data, we used the subset of stellar flare lightcurves observed by Kepler, with strong evidence of decaying QPP identified hitherto with other methods. Then, the FCN was applied to find QPPs in a larger-scale Kepler flare catalogue comprised of 2274 events, resulting in a 7% QPP detection rate with a probability above 95%. The FCN, implemented in Python, is accessible through a browser application with a user-friendly graphical interface and detailed installation and usage guide. The obtained results demonstrate that the developed FCN performs well and successfully detects exponentially decaying harmonic QPP in real flare data, and can be used as a tool for preliminary sifting of the QPP events of this type in future large-scale observational surveys.</description>

      <title>A combined study of thermohaline mixing and envelope overshooting with PARSEC: Calibration to NGC 6397 and M4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermohaline mixing is one of the main processes in low-mass red giant stars that affect the transport of chemicals and, thus, the surface abundances along the evolution. The interplay of thermohaline mixing with other processes, such as the downward overshooting from the convective envelope, should be carefully investigated. This study aims to understand the combined effects of thermohaline mixing and envelope overshooting. After implementing the thermohaline mixing process in the \textsc{parsec} stellar evolutionary code, we compute tracks and isochrones (with \textsc{trilegal} code) and compare them with observational data. To constrain the efficiencies of both processes, we perform a detailed modelling that is suitable for globular clusters NGC 6397 and M4. Our results indicate that an envelope overshooting efficiency parameter, $\Lambda_\mathrm{e}=0.6$, and a thermohaline efficiency parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{th}=50$, are necessary to reproduce the RGB bump magnitudes and lithium abundances observed in these clusters. We find that both envelope overshooting and thermohaline mixing have a significant impact on the variation of $^7$Li abundances. Additionally, we also explore the effects of adopting solar-scaled or $\alpha$-enhanced mixtures on our models. The $^{12}$C and the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio are also effective indicators to probe extra mixing in RGB stars. Although, their usefulness is currently limited by the lack of precise and accurate C-isotopes abundances.</description>

      <title>Revisiting physical parameters of the benchmark brown dwarf LHS 6343 C through a HST/WFC3 secondary eclipse observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHS 6343 system consists of a resolved M-dwarf binary with an evolved, negligibly irradiated brown dwarf, LHS 6343 C, orbiting the primary star. Such brown dwarf eclipsing binaries present rare and unique opportunities to calibrate sub-stellar evolutionary and atmosphere models since mass, radius, temperature and luminosity can be directly measured. We update this brown dwarf's mass (62.6+/-2.2 MJup) and radius (0.788+/-0.043 RJup) using empirical stellar relations and a Gaia DR3 distance. We use Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 observations of an LHS 6343 C secondary eclipse to obtain a NIR emission spectrum, which matches to a spectral type of T1.5+/-1. We combine this spectrum with existing Kepler and Spitzer/IRAC secondary eclipse photometry to perform atmospheric characterization using the ATMO-2020, Sonora-Bobcat and BT-Settl model grids. ATMO-2020 models with strong non-equilibrium chemistry yield the best fit to observations across all modelled bandpasses while predicting physical parameters consistent with Gaia-dependant analogs. BT-Settl predicts values slightly more consistent with such analogs but offers a significantly poorer fit to the WFC3 spectrum. Finally, we obtain a semi-empirical measurement of LHS 6343 C's apparent luminosity by integrating its observed and modelled spectral energy distribution. Applying knowledge of the system's distance yields a bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol/Lsun) = -4.77+/-0.03 and, applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the known radius, an effective temperature of 1303+/-29 K. We also use the ATMO-2020 and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary model grids to infer an age for LHS 6343 C of 2.86 +0.40-0.33 Gyr and 3.11 +0.50-0.38 Gyr respectively.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Fate of Exoplanet Systems: Asteroseismic Identification of Host Star in the Red Clump or Red Giant Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the evolutionary stage of stars is crucial for understanding the evolution of exoplanetary systems. In this context, Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Red Clump (RC) stars, stages in the later evolution of stars situated before and after the helium flash, harbor critical clues to unveiling the evolution of planets. The first step in revealing these clues is to confirm the evolutionary stage of the host stars through asteroseismology. However, up to now, host stars confirmed to be RGB or RC stars are extremely rare. In this investigation, we present a comprehensive asteroseismic analysis of two evolved stars, HD 120084 and HD 29399, known to harbor exoplanets, using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We have discovered for the first time that HD 120084 is a Red Clump star in the helium-core burning phase, and confirmed that HD 29399 is a Red Giant Branch star in the hydrogen-shell burning phase. Through the precise measurement of asteroseismic parameters such as $\nu_{max}$, $\Delta\nu$ and $\Delta\Pi_{1}$ we have determined the evolutionary states of these stars and derived their fundamental stellar parameters.
  The significance of this study lies in the application of automated techniques to measure asymptotic period spacings in red giants, which provides critical insights into the evolutionary outcomes of exoplanet systems. We demonstrate that asteroseismology is a potent tool for probing the internal structures of stars, thereby offering a window into the past and future dynamics of planetary orbits. The presence of a long-period giant planet orbiting HD 120084, in particular, raises intriguing questions about the potential engulfment of inner planets during the host star's expansion, a hypothesis that warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>A Dust-Scattering Model for M1-92: A Revised Estimate of the Mass Distribution and Inclination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preplanetary nebulae (PPNe) are formed from mass-ejecting late-stage AGB stars. Much of the light from the star gets scattered or absorbed by dust particles, giving rise to the observed reflection nebula seen at visible and near-IR wavelengths. Precursors to planetary nebulae (PNe), PPNe generally have not yet undergone any ionization by UV radiation from the still-buried stellar core. Bipolar PPNe are a common form of observed PPNe. This study lays the groundwork for future dynamical studies by reconstructing the dust density distribution of a particularly symmetric bipolar PPN, M1-92 (Minkowski's Footprint, IRAS 19343$+$2926). For this purpose, we develop an efficient single-scattering radiative transfer model with corrections for double-scattering. Using a V-band image from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we infer the dust density profile and orientation of M1-92. These results indicate that M1-92's slowly expanding equatorial torus exhibits an outer radial cutoff in its density, which implicates the influence of a binary companion during the formation of the nebula.</description>

Abstract: The BOREXINO experiment has been collecting solar neutrino data since 2007, providing the opportunity to study the variation of the event rate over a decade. We find that at 96 \% C.L., the rate of low energy events shows a time modulation favoring a correlation with a flux from Jupiter. We present a new physics model, the Jovian Whisper Model, based on dark matter of mass $\sim 0.1-4$ GeV captured by Jupiter that can account for such modulation. We discuss how the Jovian Whisper Model (JWM) can be tested.</description>

      <title>Whispering in the dark: Faint X-ray emission from black holes with OB star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>In LIGO's Sight? Vigorous Coherent Gravitational Waves from Cooled Collapsar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various nonaxisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 20 and a rate similar to Type Ib/c supernovae, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.</description>
