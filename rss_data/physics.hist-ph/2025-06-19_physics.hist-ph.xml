      <title>An Annotated Translation of D. Bernoulli's "A New Theory on the Motion of Waters Through Channels of Any Kind"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an annotated English translation of Daniel Bernoulli's 1727 work A New Theory on the Motion of Waters through Channels of Any Kind, originally published in the Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae. Written over a decade before his renowned Hydrodynamica (1738), this early treatise reveals D. Bernoulli's foundational approach to fluid motion based on the conservation of vis viva-the kinetic energy of moving bodies-at a time when the principle was still under active debate. In this work, D. Bernoulli applies mechanical reasoning to fluids flowing through channels of arbitrary shape, deriving relationships between velocity, cross-sectional area, and efflux under ideal conditions. He anticipates core results of Hydrodynamica, including the inverse relationship between flow velocity and cross-sectional area, and emphasizes the role of energy balance in analyzing steady flow. The text also includes reflections on experimental limitations, the influence of friction, and the boundaries of theoretical applicability. This translation highlights the historical and conceptual significance of the 1727 paper as a precursor to D. Bernoulli's mature hydrodynamic theory.</description>

      <title>Blurred orbits and blurred particles: Heisenberg's 1926 helium atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Old Quantum Mechanics by Bohr and Sommerfeld from a Modern Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review Bohr's atomic model and its extension by Sommerfeld from a mathematical perspective of wave mechanics. The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>
