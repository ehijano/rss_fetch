      <title>Multi-faceted Neuroimaging Data Integration via Analysis of Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroimaging studies, such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), often collect multi-faceted and multi-block data to study the complex human brain. However, these data are often analyzed in a pairwise fashion, which can hinder our understanding of how different brain-related measures interact with each other. In this study, we comprehensively analyze the multi-block HCP data using the Data Integration via Analysis of Subspaces (DIVAS) method. We integrate structural and functional brain connectivity, substance use, cognition, and genetics in an exhaustive five-block analysis. This gives rise to the important finding that genetics is the single data modality most predictive of brain connectivity, outside of brain connectivity itself. Nearly 14\% of the variation in functional connectivity (FC) and roughly 12\% of the variation in structural connectivity (SC) is attributed to shared spaces with genetics. Moreover, investigations of shared space loadings provide interpretable associations between particular brain regions and drivers of variability, such as alcohol consumption in the substance-use data block. Novel Jackstraw hypothesis tests are developed for the DIVAS framework to establish statistically significant loadings. For example, in the (FC, SC, and Substance Use) shared space, these novel hypothesis tests highlight largely negative functional and structural connections suggesting the brain's role in physiological responses to increased substance use. Furthermore, our findings have been validated using a subset of genetically relevant siblings or twins not studied in the main analysis.</description>

      <title>Role of Data-driven Regional Growth Model in Shaping Brain Folding Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface morphology of the developing mammalian brain is crucial for understanding brain function and dysfunction. Computational modeling offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms for early brain folding. While previous studies generally assume uniform growth, recent findings indicate significant regional variations in brain tissue growth. However, the role of these variations in cortical development remains unclear. In this study, we explored how regional cortical growth affects brain folding patterns. We first developed growth models for typical cortical regions using ML-assisted symbolic regression, based on longitudinal data from over 1,000 infant MRI scans that captured cortical surface area and thickness during perinatal and postnatal brains development. These models were subsequently integrated into computational software to simulate cortical development with anatomically realistic geometric models. We quantified the resulting folding patterns using metrics such as mean curvature, sulcal depth, and gyrification index. Our results demonstrate that regional growth models generate complex brain folding patterns that more closely match actual brains structures, both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared to uniform growth models. Growth magnitude plays a dominant role in shaping folding patterns, while growth trajectory has a minor influence. Moreover, multi-region models better capture the intricacies of brain folding than single-region models. Our results underscore the necessity and importance of incorporating regional growth heterogeneity into brain folding simulations, which could enhance early diagnosis and treatment of cortical malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy and autism.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework for Modeling Emergence of Color Vision in the Human Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a mystery how the brain decodes color vision purely from the optic nerve signals it receives, with a core inferential challenge being how it disentangles internal perception with the correct color dimensionality from the unknown encoding properties of the eye. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework for modeling this emergence of human color vision by simulating both the eye and the cortex. Existing research often overlooks how the cortex develops color vision or represents color space internally, assuming that the color dimensionality is known a priori; however, we argue that the visual cortex has the capability and the challenge of inferring the color dimensionality purely from fluctuations in the optic nerve signals. To validate our theory, we introduce a simulation engine for biological eyes based on established vision science and generate optic nerve signals resulting from looking at natural images. Further, we propose a model of cortical learning based on self-supervised principle and show that this model naturally learns to generate color vision by disentangling retinal invariants from the sensory signals. When the retina contains N types of color photoreceptors, our simulation shows that N-dimensional color vision naturally emerges, verified through formal colorimetry. Using this framework, we also present the first simulation work that successfully boosts the color dimensionality, as observed in gene therapy on squirrel monkeys, and demonstrates the possibility of enhancing human color vision from 3D to 4D.</description>

      <title>FAST functional connectivity implicates P300 connectivity in working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>

Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.</description>

      <title>Identifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder through the electroencephalogram complexity</title>

Abstract: There are reasons to suggest that a number of mental disorders may be related to alteration in the neural complexity (NC). Thus, quantitative analysis of NC could be helpful in classifying mental and understanding conditions. Here, focusing on a methodological procedure, we have worked with young individuals, typical and with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) whose NC was assessed using q-statistics applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG was recorded while subjects performed the visual Attention Network Test (ANT) and during a short pretask period of resting state. Time intervals of the EEG amplitudes that passed a threshold were collected from task and pretask signals from each subject. The data were satisfactorily fitted with a stretched $q$-exponential including a power-law prefactor(characterized by the exponent c), thus determining the best $(c, q)$ for each subject, indicative of their individual complexity. We found larger values of $q$ and $c$ in ADHD subjects as compared with the typical subjects both at task and pretask periods, the task values for both groups being larger than at rest. The $c$ parameter was highly specific in relation to DSM diagnosis for inattention, where well-defined clusters were observed. The parameter values were organized in four well-defined clusters in $(c, q)$-space. As expected, the tasks apparently induced greater complexity in neural functional states with likely greater amount of internal information processing. The results suggest that complexity is higher in ADHD subjects than in typical pairs. The distribution of values in the $(c, q)$-space derived from $q$-statistics seems to be a promising biomarker for ADHD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>A Markovian dynamics for C. elegans behavior across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do we capture the breadth of behavior in animal movement, from rapid body twitches to aging? Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm $C. elegans$, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations with trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among microstates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using resistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of the worm's foraging behavior, revealing both "runs-and-pirouettes" as well as previously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies.</description>
