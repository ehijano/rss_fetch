      <title>An Analytic Solution for Asset Allocation with a Multivariate Laplace Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note the theory for multivariate asset allocation with elliptically symmetric distributions of returns, as developed in the author's prior work, is specialized to the case of returns drawn from a multivariate Laplace distribution. This analysis delivers a result closely, but not perfectly, consistent with the conjecture presented in the author's article Thinking Differently About Asset Allocation. The principal differences are due to the introduction of a term in the dimensionality of the problem, which was omitted from the conjectured solution, and a rescaling of the variance due to varying parameterizations of the univariate Laplace distribution.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Portfolio Optimization In The QUBO Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum-inspired optimization approach is proposed to study the portfolio optimization aimed at selecting an optimal mix of assets based on the risk-return trade-off to achieve the desired goal in investment. By integrating conventional approaches with quantum-inspired methods for penalty coefficient estimation, this approach enables faster and accurate solutions to portfolio optimization which is validated through experiments using a real-world dataset of quarterly financial data spanning over ten-year period. In addition, the proposed preprocessing method of two-stage search further enhances the effectiveness of our approach, showing the ability to improve computational efficiency while maintaining solution accuracy through appropriate setting of parameters. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on quantum-inspired techniques in finance, demonstrating its potential as a useful tool for asset allocation and portfolio management.</description>
