      <title>An experiment in price perception error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of consumer decision-making is multidimensional, and price perception is a very important but still not well-understood dimension for both marketers and consumers. Although heuristics or mental shortcuts are seen as biased and can cause decision errors, consumers tend to use price knowledge heuristics for purchase decisions, sometimes relying on old information. This study examined the effects of individual attitudinal and demographic factors on the ability of 351 respondents to correctly guess the prices of 13 products and services using ANOVA and the development of a seven-factor price perception model using latent variable analysis. While most respondents preferred to either research prices first or compare prices to a similar product, they either systematically underestimated or overestimated the prices of the products. In the ANOVA, brand loyalty, importance of substitute products and knockoff products, how financially well-off the respondent household was growing up, product quality importance, haggling tendency, and level of income were statistically significant predictors of price perception error. Latent variable analysis revealed that demographics, decision making, and price sensitivity factors had the greatest influence on price perception error. Level of education and income, frequency of regret, coupon importance, and how respondents chose to save or spend money were significant latent variables.</description>

      <title>Exiting National Anti-Poverty Campaign, Social Support, and Improved Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the psychological and social impacts of exiting a national anti-poverty campaign, leveraging China's phase-out of its national poverty assistance as a natural experiment. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that exiting the national campaign improves mental wellbeing. These improvements are accompanied by stronger social and family ties -- such as greater perceived support and communication, while income and material conditions remain largely unchanged. Our findings offer insights into the design of policy exits and underscore the importance of incorporating measures that sustain community- and family-based support systems when implementing or ending assistance programs.</description>

      <title>Cost-benefit analysis of an AI-driven operational digital platform for integrated electric mobility, renewable energy, and grid management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating electric mobility (electric vehicles (EVs), electric trucks (ETs)) and renewable energy sources (RES) with the power grid is paramount for achieving decarbonization, efficiency, and stability. Given the rapid growth of decentralized technologies and their critical role in decarbonization, two critical challenges emerge: first, the development of a digital platform for operational coordination; and second, rigorous research into their cost-benefit profile. This paper addresses this by presenting a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of an AI-driven operational digital platform (ODP) designed for holistic, cross-sectoral optimization. The ODP aims to enhance energy efficiency, grid reliability, and environmental sustainability. A seven-step CBA framework, aligned with EU guidelines, quantifies economic, reliability, and environmental benefits against capital and operational expenditures, explicitly linking benefit magnitude to AI-driven ODP and optimization efficiencies, such as quantified improvements in market arbitrage from ODP, enabled forecasting, and enhanced operational efficiencies across various services.</description>

      <title>Introducing RobustiPy: An efficient next generation multiversal library with model selection, averaging, resampling, and explainable artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RobustiPy, a next generation Python-based framework for model uncertainty quantification and multiverse analysis, released under the GNU GPL v3.0. Through the integration of efficient bootstrap-based confidence intervals, combinatorial exploration of dependent-variable specifications, model selection and averaging, and two complementary joint-inference routines, RobustiPy transcends existing uncertainty-quantification tools. Its design further supports rigorous out-of-sample evaluation and apportions the predictive contribution of each covariate. We deploy the library across five carefully constructed simulations and ten empirically grounded case studies drawn from high-impact literature and teaching examples, including a novel re-analysis of "unexplained discrepancies" in famous prior work. To illustrate its performance, we time-profile RobustiPy over roughly 672 million simulated linear regressions. These applications showcase how RobustiPy not only accelerates robust inference but also deepens our interpretive insight into model sensitivity across the vast analytical multiverse within which scientists operate.</description>

      <title>Narrative Shift Detection: A Hybrid Approach of Dynamic Topic Models and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts. We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in content or a narrative shift took place.</description>

      <title>On Causal Inference with Model-Based Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19563v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a causal inference problem with group-level outcomes, which are themselves parameters identified from microdata. We formalize these outcomes using population moment conditions and demonstrate that one-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators are generally inconsistent due to an endogenous weighting bias, where policy affects the implicit GMM weights. In contrast, two-stage Minimum Distance (MD) estimators perform well when group sizes are sufficiently large. While MD estimators can still be inconsistent in small groups due to a policy-induced sample selection, we demonstrate that this can be addressed by incorporating auxiliary population information. An empirical application illustrates the practical importance of these findings.</description>

      <title>Part-Time Penalties and Heterogeneous Retirement Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Older male workers exhibit diverse retirement behaviors across occupations and respond differently to policy changes, influenced significantly by the part-time penalty-wage reduction faced by part-time workers compared to their full-time counterparts. Many older individuals reduce their working hours, and in occupations with high part-time penalties, they tend to retire earlier, as observed in data from Japan and the United States. This study develops a general equilibrium model that incorporates occupational choices, endogenous labor supply, highlighting that the impact on the retirement decision is amplified by the presence of assets and pensions. Using the Japanese Panel Study of Employment Dynamics, I find that cutting employees' pension benefits reduce aggregate labor supply in occupations with high part-time penalties, reducing overall welfare across the economy. Furthermore, a commonly used policy measure-extending the pension eligibility age-is also found to decrease both output and welfare. In contrast, this paper suggests that increasing income tax credits and exempting pension benefits from income taxation can boost labor supply across all occupations. These policies enhance welfare by raising disposable income relative to the reservation wage.</description>

      <title>International Trade and Intellectual Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intellectual property (IP) rules have the potential to shape cross-border trade far more than their legalistic origins might suggest. Drawing on three decades of evidence, this review shows that stronger IP rights simultaneously create market-power forces that raise prices and market-expansion forces that broaden demand, while dynamic incentives spur quality upgrading and new export varieties. Micro-data and quasi-natural experiments after TRIPS reveal that IP most often boosts trade along the extensive margin and redirects some activity toward licensing and foreign investment. Policy bundling and measurement gaps on the strength of IP rights still cloud causal inference. Future work must map intangible flows and enforcement quality to capture the digital, data-driven frontier of international commerce.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Crop Price Volatility in India: Case studies of Soybean and Brinjal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate is an evolving complex system with dynamic interactions and non-linear feedback mechanisms, shaping environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Crop production is highly sensitive to climatic fluctuations (and many other environmental, social and governance factors). This paper studies the price volatility of agricultural crops as influenced by meteorological variables, which is critical for agricultural planning, sustainable finance and policy-making. As case studies, we choose the two Indian states: Madhya Pradesh (for Soybean) and Odisha (for Brinjal/Eggplant). We employ an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to estimate the conditional volatility of the log returns from 2012 to 2024. We further explore the cross-correlations between price volatility and the meteorological variables followed by a Granger-causal test to analyze the causal effect of meteorological variables on the volatility. The Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine learning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous variables. Finally, to capture spatial dependencies in volatility across districts, we extend the analysis using a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model to construct monthly volatility surfaces that reflect both local price risk as well as geographic dependence. We believe, this paper will illustrate the usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and help the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and making beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In general, incorporating meteorological factors to assess agricultural performance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly lead to economic stability.</description>
