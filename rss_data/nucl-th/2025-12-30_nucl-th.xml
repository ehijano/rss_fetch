      <title>Bidirectional Neural Networks for Global Nucleon-Nucleus Optical Model Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern nuclear data evaluation increasingly requires not only accurate scattering calculations, but also efficient methods for uncertainty quantification and parameter optimization, tasks that benefit from differentiable solvers amenable to gradient-based algorithms. I present a neural network emulator based on Bidirectional Liquid Neural Networks (BiLNN) that provides a fully differentiable mapping from optical potential parameters to scattering wave functions. The key innovation enabling generalization across the parameter space is the use of phase-space coordinates $\rho = kr$ that normalize the oscillation wavelength regardless of projectile energy, allowing a single network to span 1 to 200~MeV. Trained on Numerov solutions for twelve target nuclei (\nuc{12}{C} to \nuc{208}{Pb}), both protons and neutrons, and partial waves up to $l=30$, the network achieves an overall relative error of 1.2\%. The predicted wave functions yield accurate $S$-matrix elements and elastic scattering cross sections, reproducing diffraction patterns spanning four orders of magnitude. Importantly, the model extrapolates successfully to nuclei not included in training (\nuc{24}{Mg}, \nuc{63}{Cu}, \nuc{184}{W}) with comparable accuracy, demonstrating that it has learned the physics of the optical model rather than memorizing specific targets. The differentiable nature of the trained model opens the door to gradient-based optimization of optical model parameters and efficient uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Exploring Interplays Between $^3\text{P}_2$ Neutron Superfluid Vortices and $^1\text{S}_0$ Proton Fluxtubes in the Outer Core of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the outer core of neutron stars, $^3$P$_2$ superfluid neutrons and $^1$S$_0$ superconducting protons are deemed to exist, forming quantum vortices and magnetic fluxtubes, respectively. Those quantum vortices and fluxtubes play an important role in explaining observed sudden changes of rotational frequency, known as pulsar ``glitches.'' While the most of conventional glitch models rely on pinning/unpinning dynamics of neutron $^1\text{S}_0$ superfluid vortices in the inner crust, contributions of the outer core have not been ruled out. However, the latter possibility has been less explored so far and further thorough investigations are desired. In this study, we are thus developing a microscopic model based on spin-2 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for neutron $^3$P$_2$ superfluid vortices coupled with Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for fluxtubes associated with superconducting $^1\text{S}_0$ protons. In this contribution, we outline our theoretical framework and report tentative results showing how shape of quantum vortices could be affected by the presence of a proton fluxtube.</description>

      <title>Bound States of $\Omega$ Baryons in Light Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bound states of light $\Omega_{3x}$-clusters ($x = s, c$), motivated by the $\Omega_{3s}N$ potential recently developed by the HAL QCD collaboration. To regularize this potential, we remove the deeply attractive core at $r &lt; 0.4~\mathrm{fm}$ and parametrize the long-range component ($r &gt; 0.4~\mathrm{fm}$) using a two-range Gaussian form. This procedure preserves the relevant two-body bound state energy while having a negligible effect on the $\Omega_{3s}NN$ and $\Omega_{3s}\Omega_{3s}N$ systems. An effective $\Omega_{3s}\alpha$ potential is then constructed by fitting a two-range Gaussian function to the long-range component of the folding potential, enabling calculations of the bound state energies of the $\Omega_{3s}\alpha$, $\Omega_{3s}\alpha\alpha$, and $\Omega_{3s}\Omega_{3s}\alpha$ systems. The regularization procedure leads to a substantial reduction in bound state energies compared to those obtained with the original potential. We further extend the analysis to $\Omega_{3c}$-cluster systems by introducing an $\Omega_{3c}N$ interaction, derived by comparing the existing $\Omega_{3s}\Omega_{3s}$ and $\Omega_{3c}\Omega_{3c}$ potentials. Our results suggest that several parametrizations predict bound states in $\Omega_{3c}$-containing clusters. Finally, the $\Omega_{3s}\Omega_{3s}$ interaction is described using a contact-like potential approach, motivated by the effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the role of the surface energy in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saturation of symmetric nuclear matter -- reflected in the nearly constant interior density of heavy nuclei -- is a defining property of nuclear matter. Modern relativistic energy density functionals (EDFs) calibrated exclusively to the properties of finite nuclei, make robust predictions with quantified uncertainties about the bulk properties of symmetric nuclear matter in the vicinity of the saturation density. Following the same fitting protocol, nonrelativistic Skyrme EDFs systematically predict higher saturation densities than their relativistic counterparts. To investigate this tension in the bulk limit, we study the ground-state properties of hypothetical symmetric macroscopic nuclei containing thousands of nucleons. Using both relativistic and non-relativistic EDF frameworks, we extract the corresponding liquid-drop parameters. We find a clear correlation between the volume and surface energy coefficients: Skyrme models, which saturate at higher densities, develop softer and more diffuse surfaces with lower surface energies, whereas relativistic EDFs, which saturate at lower densities, produce more defined and less diffuse surfaces with higher surface energies. This compensating behavior allows both classes of models to reproduce empirical nuclear radii despite their distinct saturation properties. Our analysis suggests that the apparent disparity in saturation densities arises from the intrinsic balance among saturation density, bulk binding energy, and surface tension, rather than from the fitting protocol.</description>

      <title>Kinematic and dynamical origins of mean-$p_T$ fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum (mean-$p_T$) provide a sensitive probe of collective dynamics beyond single-particle spectra and anisotropic flow. In this study, we present a systematic comparison of mean-$p_T$ fluctuation measurements with calculations based on a Bayesian-calibrated multistage hydrodynamic framework. The experimental definitions employed by the STAR and ALICE Collaborations are implemented explicitly and found to yield consistent results within controlled limits. We study the centrality and beam-energy dependence of the observable, its sensitivity to key soft-sector ingredients, and the impact of the kinematic $p_T$ acceptance. By introducing scaled-$p_T$ cuts, we demonstrate that a part of the apparent energy dependence arises from kinematic projection effects, while the remaining trends reflect genuine collective dynamics. Our results establish mean-$p_T$ fluctuations as a nontrivial and independent validation of calibrated hydrodynamic descriptions of the quark--gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Factorized distorted wave calculations for electron, neutrino, and BSM processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that, under certain conditions, the nuclear currents that couple to vector bosons can be written as the trace of the product of two matrices. One contains `nucleon dynamics', e.g. form factors, the other contains the overlaps of nuclear wavefunctions. This factorized form may always be obtained and viewed as a `local' approximation, in which particle four-momenta that enter in the transition operator are fixed to their asymptotic values. We write the overlap matrix in a general form in terms of Dirac matrices. The current with arbitrary couplings to the nucleon can then be evaluated using standard trace identities. We show that this encompasses non-relativistic models as well. We have tabulated overlaps obtained in the relativistic distorted-wave impulse approximation, which can be used to compute the single-nucleon knockout cross section. We give a self-contained overview of the formulae. We discuss some properties of the overlap matrices which may be derived from general principles, and highlight differences with the commonly used plane-wave impulse approximation. The factorized form is attractive for (neutrino) event generators: it abstracts away the nuclear model and allows to easily modify couplings to the nucleon. This allows to consistently treat electron, neutrino and beyond Standard Model (BSM) processes.</description>

      <title>The effect of inversion of $p$ and $f$ orbits on halo formation in heavy sodium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of the inversion of the $p$ and $f$ shell-model orbits in the emergence of halo structures in the ground states of neutron-rich $^{34,37,39}$Na is investigated. Families of two- and three-body models are constructed with effective core-neutron interactions, with parameter choices based on a combination of the available experimental data and systematic trends, as well as the GPT $n$-$n$ interaction and a phenomenological three-body force. Our results indicate a possible one-neutron halo in $^{34}$Na, while $^{37,39}$Na exhibit features of Borromean halos. The halo formation is driven by the weakening of the shell gap and inversion of the $2p_{3/2}$ and $1f_{7/2}$ orbits expected to occur somewhere near these masses. We further show that the electric dipole response provides a clear and sensitive probe of halo structure in these isotopes.</description>

      <title>Basis truncation and statistical errors in the relativistic approaches to nuclear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although there exists a clear and, in principle, exact theoretical formulation for the equation of motion for the response of a correlated fermionic system, its numerical implementations for atomic nuclei require feasible approximations. One of the widely accepted approximations is a truncated harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, whose wave functions are used to expand the solutions obtained with realistic interactions. In this work, we extend previously employed HO basis truncated at $N_F$ = 20 fermionic shells to $N_F$ = 50 and perform a systematic study of the effects of such basis increase on nuclear resonances. The relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) and its extension by the particle-vibration coupling dubbed as relativistic time-blocking approximation (RTBA) are applied to the description of the monopole, dipole, quadrupole, and octupole resonances in $^{48}$Ca, $^{78}$Ni, and $^{132}$Sn, and the RRPA studies are extended to $^{70}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. A considerable sensitivity of the strength distributions to the HO basis size is found, especially for low-spin resonances in the light neutron-rich nuclei. The effects of the HO basis extension to $N_F$ = 50 are analyzed and linked to the involvement of proton and neutron continuum states and proton quasi-bound states in the strength formation. The obtained results point to the importance of the HO basis completeness and continuum effects in the nuclear response calculations and evaluation of the associated parameters of the nuclear equation of state. In addition, statistical errors in the RRPA strength functions, which emerge from the details of the fitting protocol of the covariant energy density functional employed, are analyzed. It turns out that they are quite substantial for the monopole response, but significantly smaller for the dipole, quadrupole, and octupole ones.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Equation of State with Nucleon Short-Range Correlations: A Concise Review and Open Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and the associated high-momentum tail (HMT) in its momentum distribution $n(k)$ represent a universal feature of strongly interacting Fermi systems. In nuclear matter, SRCs arise primarily from the spin-isospin dependence of the tensor and short-range components of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, leading to a substantial depletion of its Fermi sea and a characteristic $k^{-4}$ tail populated predominantly by isosinglet neutron-proton pairs. These microscopic structures modify both the kinetic and interaction contributions to the Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter and thereby influence a broad range of neutron-star (NS) properties. This short review provides a streamlined overview of how SRC-induced changes in $n(k)$ reshape the kinetic EOS, including its symmetry energy part and how these effects propagate into macroscopic NS observables, including mass-radius relations, tidal deformabilities, direct Urca thresholds and core-crust transition. We summarize key existing results, highlight current observational constraints relevant for testing SRC-HMT effects, and outline open questions for future theoretical, experimental, and multimessenger studies of dense nucleonic matter.</description>

      <title>Poles from the conserved kinetic equation : The emerging gradient structure and causality riddle of relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the poles and the resulting dispersion spectra from the relativistic kinetic equation have been analyzed with the help of a proposed collision kernel that conserves both the energy-momentum tensor and particle current by construction. The dispersion relations, which originally come out in the form of logarithmic divergences, in the long wavelength limit exhibit the systematic gradient structure of the relativistic hydrodynamics. The key result is that, in the derivative expansion series, the spatial gradients appear in perfect unison with the temporal gradients in the non-local relaxation operator like forms. It is then shown that this dispersion structure, including non-local temporal derivatives, is essential for the preservation of causality of the theory truncated at any desired order.</description>

      <title>Compact star and compact star matter properties from a baryonic extended linear sigma model with explicit chiral symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a baryonic extended linear sigma model including explicit chiral symmetry breaking effect, the structure of neutron star with the emergence of hyperons is investigated using the relativistic mean field approximation. It's found that, except the lightest scalar meson $\sigma$ whose structure is not well understood so far, the vacuum mass spectra of relevant hadrons and NM properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Nevertheless, we found that, to have a realistic mass-radius relation of neutron stars, the $\pi N$ sigma term $\sigma_{\pi N}$, which denotes the contribution of explicit symmetry breaking, should deviate from its empirical values at vacuum. Specifically, $\sigma_{\pi N}\sim -600$ MeV, rather than $(32-89) \rm \ MeV$ at vacuum. With an appropriate choice of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ and $K(n_0)$, our framework can give a more data favored mass-radius relation of neutron stars with the emergence of hyperons. The effect of explicit symmetry breaking at densities is hoped to provide a new insight to the relation between microscopic symmetries in medium and macroscopic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Recent advancements in the strongly coupled many-body theory for nuclear spectral computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent advancements of the nuclear many-body theory and selected results on nuclear giant and pygmy resonances are presented. The theory is compactly reviewed, with a special focus on the emergent scale of the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC), which carries the order parameter associated with the qPVC vertex, and an efficient treatment of the nuclear many-body problem organized around the qPVC hierarchy. Self-consistent numerical solutions of the relativistic Bethe-Salpeter-Dyson equation for the nuclear response function in medium-heavy nuclei are discussed. The presented update on the pygmy dipole resonance focuses on establishing the formation of its two-component structure as a result of the fragmentation of the low-energy dipole mode due to the qPVC and its mixing with the similarly fragmented giant dipole resonance. The centroid of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance is also linked to qPVC effects, particularly to its sensitivity to the coupling of the collective breathing mode to the lowest quadrupole vibrations, which is enhanced by quadrupole collectivity. The resolution of the long-standing "fluffiness" puzzle regarding the compressibility of open-shell tin isotopes is summarized. The recently developed thermal variant of the superfluid response theory is briefly introduced and continuously linked to the description of the isoscalar monopole response at finite temperature with the prospect of refining the temperature-dependent nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Transport In Low Dimension Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation presents a systematic theoretical investigation into realizing a condensed matter analogue of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in a quasi-planar, 2+1D system. The research establishes a conceptual bridge between the anomalous transport phenomena of high-energy physics and the emergent electronic properties of engineered honeycomb lattices. The central objective is the formulation of a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the necessary ingredients for a CME-like effect. This is achieved by moving beyond pristine graphene, whose inherent sublattice symmetry precludes the formation of a mass gap necessary for defining robust pseudo-chiral states. The core of this work is a model based on a honeycomb lattice with explicitly broken sublattice symmetry, which introduces a band gap and endows the quasi-particles system with a well-defined pseudo-chirality based on sublattice polarization. A time-reversal symmetry-breaking parameter is introduced to asymmetrically modify the valley gaps, creating a controllable non-equilibrium imbalance analogous to the chiral chemical potential in relativistic systems. A key finding is the validation of the physical model consistency; through commutator calculations, the total angular momentum - comprising both orbital and an emergent lattice spin component - is shown to be a conserved quantity. This research successfully transforms the abstract possibility of a 2D CME into a concrete, self-consistent theoretical framework, detailing the precise symmetry conditions required for its manifestation.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum in the pion and kaon: rest-frame and light-front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is not a Poincar\'e invariant quantity; so, its value is observer dependent. Notwithstanding that, in quantum chromodynamics, a Poincar\'e-invariant theory, OAM is part of every hadron wave function. Using continuum Schwinger function methods, we elucidate both the subjective character of in-hadron OAM and expose some of its impacts on pion and kaon structure and observables. For instance, working with light-front projections of their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions, it is found that the pion is a roughly 50/50 mix of light-front OAM zero and one components and the kaon is a 60/40 system. The overall picture is that (near) Nambu-Goldstone modes are complex bound states, each with significant intrinsic OAM, independent of the observer's reference frame. This feature must be accounted for in the calculation of observables. Inductively, the same is true for all hadrons.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium QCD in heavy-ion collisions: Kinetic theory and jet modifications during the initial stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on how jets are modified by the nonequilibrium quark-gluon plasma during the initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Its influence on their propagation is typically encoded in a single medium function, the dipole cross section. Its small distance behavior is characterized by the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$, and we obtain its numerical value throughout the pre-equilibrium stage, finding values comparable in magnitude to the earlier Glasma stage. We also compute the more general elastic collision kernel, obtained by Fourier transforming the dipole cross section. This constitutes an important step to facilitate the understanding of jet-medium interactions during the initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Additionally, we improve QCD kinetic theory simulations by employing a more realistic (HTL) screening mechanism to incorporate medium effects, which we compare with simpler screening mechanisms. An expanding plasma realized in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions exhibits a significantly reduced maximum anisotropy and reduced specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ when using the improved screening prescription. Moreover, we investigate the gluon splitting rates, which are typically obtained using an isotropic model for the collision kernel. Going beyond that approximation, we find that the splitting rates obtained from the nonequilibrium anisotropic kernel differ significantly both in magnitude and in their qualitative time evolution. We further identify a novel type of weak-coupling attractor, which can be observed in the ratio of the jet quenching parameter and pressure ratio, and is obtained by extrapolating to vanishing coupling. This improved kinetic theory description and novel limiting attractors contribute towards a more realistic modeling of the nonequilibrium QCD plasma and its equilibration and hydrodynamization process during the initial stages.</description>

      <title>Quark Coalescence: Formation of Mesons Including Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the quantum mechanics of coalescence of quark-antiquark pairs into mesons using a non-relativistic quark model. We derive the coalescence probabilities assuming a harmonic oscillator potential and generic Gaussian wave packet shapes for the initial quarks and antiquarks. Our particular emphasis is on modeling excited states of the meson spectrum consistently. We provide the formalism to systematically include excited states from the Particle Data Book, and many more predicted by the quark model, up to $L=4$ and masses of about 2.2 GeV for light flavors. We provide estimates of masses and decay branching ratios for unconfirmed states. We use a phase space picture which is appropriate for the quasi-classical nature of the information typically available for the quarks and antiquarks in applications like Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that for typical parton configurations expected in jets, excited meson states are populated abundantly.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning final state interactions model in NuWro Monte Carlo event generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental data from MINERvA on transverse kinematics observables across four different nuclear targets - carbon, oxygen, iron, and lead - have been utilized to refine the modeling of final state interaction effects in the NuWro Monte Carlo neutrino event generator. For this purpose, we have developed an event reweighting tool for future applications to adjust the strength of final-state interactions. This study highlights the requirement for stronger nucleon reinteractions than previously assumed, but it still falls within the uncertainty range observed in a study comparing proton transparency measurements. This conclusion has significant implications for both experimental and theoretical work involving NuWro.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the twist-2 unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of quarks for an on-shell gluon target in quantum chromodynamics. These GPDs parametrize the leading-twist matrix elements of the nonlocal light-like flavor-singlet vector current. We compute them at one-loop accuracy in perturbation theory using a quark mass and dimensional regularization as infrared regulators. In particular, we discuss the limit of vanishing momentum transfer. The present work extends our previous related study on the axial current.</description>

      <title>Limits on dark matter existence in neutron stars from recent astrophysical observations and mass correlation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs) serve as a specific astrophysical laboratory for probing the features of dark matter (DM) and have emerged as a promising candidate for interpreting recent astrophysical observations (e.g., by NICER and LIGO/Virgo). Accurately constraining the internal DM content of DANSs is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f_\chi^{\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model. Our analysis reveals a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient $r=0.98$) between $f_\chi^{\mathrm{max}}$ and the maximum mass of a pure NS, $M_{\rm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}}$, described by $f_{\chi}^{\mathrm{max}} = 0.22 M_{\mathrm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}} - 0.44$. Leveraging this correlation and the observed NS maximum mass distribution, $P(M_{\text{NS}}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) for the maximum DM mass, $P(M_{\chi}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, in DANSs. We find that at the 68\% confidence level, $M_{\chi}^{\mathrm{max}}=0.150^{+0.070}_{-0.051}\ M_{\odot}$. This quantitative constraint on the DM mass provides a critical prior for interpreting potential observational signatures of DANSs, such as anomalous tidal deformabilities and distinctive gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Hadronic Matter on Parton Energy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified thermal distributions (dispersion relations) are introduced within both the MATTER and LBT event generators used to describe jet modification in a heavy-ion collision, within the JETSCAPE framework. Hard partons, propagating through dense matter, scatter off the partonic substructure of the medium, leading to stimulated emission, accompanied by recoiling medium partons. We introduce a simple modification, a multiplicative $(1 + a/T)$ correction to the dispersion relation of quarks and gluons (equivalent to an effective fugacity). This leads to calculated transport coefficients (e.g. $\hat{q}/T^3$) showing the expected behavior of depreciating at lower temperatures, including within the hot hadronic gas. This simple modification recovers the light-like dispersion relations at high temperatures, and introduces an excess depreciation factor for parton populations at lower temperatures, allowing partonic energy loss and recoil calculations to be extended into the hadronic phase. This modified distribution, in combination with initial state cold nuclear matter effects (shadowing), is used to simultaneously describe the nuclear modification factor and elliptic anisotropy of jets and leading hadrons, over multiple centralities and collision energies.</description>

      <title>Vector interaction bounds in NJL-like models from LQCD estimated curvature of the chiral crossover line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain improved bounds on both the flavor-independent and -dependent vector interactions in a $2+1$-flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model using the latest precise LQCD results of the curvature coefficients of the chiral crossover line. We find that these lattice estimated curvature coefficients allow for both attractive and repulsive types of interactions in both the cases. With this constrained ranges of vector interactions, we further predict the behavior of the second $(\kappa_2^B)$ and fourth $(\kappa_4^B)$ order curvature coefficients as a function of the strangeness chemical potential $(\mu_S)$. We observe that the flavor mixing effects, arising from the flavor-independent vector interaction as well as from the 't Hooft interaction, play an important role in $k_2^B$. We propose that the mixing effects due to the vector interaction can be separated from those arising from the 't Hooft interaction by analyzing the behavior of $k_2^B$ as a function of $\mu_S$. Finally, we locate the critical endpoint in the $T-\mu_B$ plane using the model-estimated ranges of vector interactions and find the model's predictions to be consistent with the latest LQCD bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical formalism for calculating first-order-in-opacity radiative energy loss that incorporates the spatial and temporal temperature evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a finite-size QCD medium with dynamical (i.e., moving) constituents. The derived expressions allow for arbitrary temperature profiles, enabling detailed evaluations of radiative energy loss across different medium-evolution scenarios. Importantly, the resulting kernel applies to both single partons (R = 0) and jets (R &gt; 0) via an out-of-cone selection, providing a unified starting point for precision QGP tomography.</description>

      <title>Impact of spin polarization on transport and thermodynamic coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18038v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the influence of parton spin polarization on effective transport and thermodynamic coefficients in noncentral light- and heavy-ion collisions. To model this influence, I consider two sources of spin polarization: thermal vorticity, induced by angular momentum, and thermal shear, arising from local velocity gradients. Using a novel kinetic theory framework, one finds that transport and thermodynamic coefficients -- including the speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2}$, specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$, specific bulk viscosity $\zeta/s$, and mean free path $\lambda$ -- are substantially modified by spin polarization effects. Among the two sources, thermal vorticity-induced spin polarization dominates the modifications to these coefficients. Moreover, both $c_{s}^{2}$ and $\zeta/s$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the collision energy, and the associated scaling behaviors potentially serve as indicators of the critical phenomena of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Heavy-Flavor Transport Approach for Hot QCD Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heavy charm and bottom quarks are unique probes of the transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and its hadronization in high-energy nuclear collisions. A key challenge in this context is to embed the interactions of the heavy quarks in the expanding medium compatible with the strong-coupling nature of the QGP, and thus to unravel the underlying microscopic mechanisms. In the present work we progress toward this goal by combining recent $T$-matrix interactions for elastic scattering with an effective transport implementation of gluon radiation, and apply these in a Langevin framework in a viscous hydrodynamic evolution. Hadronization of heavy quarks is evaluated using a modern recombination model with 4-momentum conservation, supplemented with fragmentation constrained by data in proton-proton collisions. Deploying this approach to charm-hadron observables in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC yields fair agreement with experiment while also identifying areas of further systematic improvement of the simulations and its current input.</description>

Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated dark-matter-admixed neutron stars, employing a realistic nuclear equation of state and realistic nuclear pairing gaps, together with fermionic dark matter of variable particle mass and dark-matter fraction. The related parameter space is scanned for the stellar structural and cooling properties. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast direct Urca cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps. Dark matter affects the cooling properties by a modification of the nuclear density profiles, but also changes stellar radius and maximum mass. Possible signals of a large dark matter content could be a very massive but slow-cooling star or a very light but fast-cooling star.</description>

Abstract: The low energy effective field theory of interacting neutrinos derived from the Standard Model may be framed as a pointlike interaction and thereby modeled on a lattice of neutrino momenta. We identify a path to take a continuum limit of this lattice problem in the Center of Momentum frame. In this limit, the weak interaction is found to become trivial between incoming plane waves describing ultrarelativistic particles, unless finite neutrino wave packet sizes are taken into consideration. We follow up with an analytic treatment of interacting neutrino wave packets, demonstrating the importance of the wave packet size for characterizing neutrino-neutrino scattering in dense environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time that scales with the inverse of the energy gap times the square root of the system size. We show that this very favorable scaling arises from the fact that resolution refinement does not make large changes to the structure or energies of the low-energy eigenstates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize recent progress toward the next generation of CTEQ-TEA parton distribution functions, CT25, based on a global NNLO analysis that incorporates a significant sample of newly included LHC data. We present a baseline fit within the forthcoming full CT25 fit, which includes new Drell-Yan, top-pair, and inclusive-jet data at 8 and 13 TeV, and exhibits non-trivial pulls on the high-$x$ gluon and the flavor structure of the quark sea. In the context of progress toward CT25, we also summarize several recent and ongoing studies of the interplay between phenomenological PDFs and lattice-QCD calculations, simultaneous extractions of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ within the CT framework, and an expanded program of uncertainty quantification that treats parametrization dependence as an explicit source of epistemic uncertainty, among other issues. We also briefly highlight CT efforts to understand the effects of partial implementations of N$^3$LO corrections into PDF fits, which include benchmark calculations for Higgs and vector-boson processes. We comment on the implications of recent improvements to the CT analysis for precision phenomenology at the LHC and future facilities.</description>
