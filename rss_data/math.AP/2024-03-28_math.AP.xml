      <title>Homogenization and continuum limit of mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When used in bulk applications, mechanical metamaterials set forth a multiscale problem with many orders of magnitude in scale separation between the micro and macro scales. However, mechanical metamaterials fall outside conventional homogenization theory on account of the flexural, or bending, response of their members, including torsion. We show that homogenization theory, based on calculus of variations and notions of Gamma-convergence, can be extended to account for bending. The resulting homogenized metamaterials exhibit intrinsic generalized elasticity in the continuum limit. We illustrate these properties in specific examples including two-dimensional honeycomb and three-dimensional octet-truss metamaterials.</description>

      <title>On the viscosity linearization method without compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Savin's small perturbation approach has had far reaching applications in the theory of non-linear elliptic and parabolic PDE. In this short note, we revisit his seminal proof of De-Giorgi's improvement of flatness theorem for minimal surfaces and provide an approach based on the Harnack inequality that avoids the use of compactness arguments.</description>

      <title>Sobolev space theory for Poisson's equation in non-smooth domains via superharmonic functions and Hardy's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general $L_p$-solvability result for the Poisson equation in non-smooth domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, with the zero Dirichlet boundary condition.
  Our sole assumption for the domain $\Omega$ is the Hardy inequality: There exists a constant $N&gt;0$ such that $$ \int_{\Omega}\Big|\frac{f(x)}{d(x,\partial\Omega)}\Big|^2\mathrm{d}\,x\leq N\int_{\Omega}|\nabla f|^2 \mathrm{d}\,x\quad\text{for any}\quad f\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)\,. $$
  To describe the boundary behavior of solutions in a general framework, we propose a weight system composed of a superharmonic function and the distance function to the boundary.
  Additionally, we explore applications across a variety of non-smooth domains, including convex domains, domains with exterior cone condition, totally vanishing exterior Reifenberg domains, and domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ for which the Aikawa dimension of $\Omega^c$ is less than $d-2$.
  Using superharmonic functions tailored to the geometric conditions of the domain, we derive weighted $L_p$-solvability results for various non-smooth domains and specific weight ranges that differ for each domain condition.
  Furthermore, we provide an application for the H\"older continuity of solutions.</description>

      <title>Classification of global solutions to the obstacle problem in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global solutions to the obstacle problem were first completely classified in two dimensions by Sakai using complex analysis techniques. Although the complex analysis approach produced a very succinct proof in two dimensions, it left the higher dimensional cases, and even closely related problems in two dimensions, unresolved. A complete classification in dimensions $n\geq 3$ was recently given by Eberle, Figalli and Weiss, forty years after Sakai published his proof. In this paper we give a proof of Sakai's classification result for unbounded coincidence sets in the spirit of the recent proof by Eberle, Figalli and Weiss. Our approach, in particular, avoids the need for complex analysis techniques and offers new perspectives on two-dimensional problems that complex analysis cannot address.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical wave-packets for weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider semiclassically scaled, weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with external confining potentials and additional angular-momentum rotation term. This type of model arises in the Gross-Pitaevskii theory of trapped, rotating quantum gases. We construct asymptotic solutions in the form of semiclassical wave-packets, which are concentrated in both space and in frequency around an classical Hamiltonian phase-space flow. The rotation term is thereby seen to alter this flow, but not the corresponding classical action.</description>

      <title>Extension method in Dirichlet spaces with sub-Gaussian estimates and applications to regularity of jump processes on fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate regularity properties of some non-local equations defined on Dirichlet spaces equipped with sub-gaussian estimates for the heat kernel associated to the generator. We prove that weak solutions for homogeneous equations involving pure powers of the generator are actually H\"older continuous and satisfy an Harnack inequality. Our methods are based on a version of the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension method which is valid in any Dirichlet space and our results complement the existing literature on solutions of PDEs on classes of Dirichlet spaces such as fractals.</description>

      <title>The sticky particle dynamics of the 1D pressureless Euler-alignment system as a gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the sticky dynamics for the one-dimensional pressureless Euler-alignment system can be obtained as an $L^2$-gradient flow of a convex functional. This is analogous to the Lagrangian evolution introduced by Natile and Savar\'{e} for the pressureless Euler system, and by Brenier et al. for the corresponding system with a self-interacting force field. Our Lagrangian evolution can be seen as the limit of sticky particle Cucker-Smale dynamics, similar to the solutions obtained by Leslie and Tan from a corresponding scalar balance law, and provides us with a uniquely determined distributional solution of the original system in the space of probability measures with quadratic moments and corresponding square-integrable velocities. Moreover, we show that the gradient flow also provides an entropy solution to the balance law of Leslie and Tan, and how their results on cluster formation follow naturally from (non-)convexity properties of the so-called natural velocity of the flow.</description>

      <title>Carleman factorization of layer potentials on smooth domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the unexplored benefits of studying layer potentials on smooth, closed hypersurfaces of Euclidean space is the factorization of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator into a product of two self-adjoint transforms. Resurrecting some pertinent indications of Carleman and M. G. Krein, we exploit this grossly overlooked structure by confining the spectral analysis of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator to the amenable $L^2$-space setting, rather than bouncing back and forth the computations between Sobolev spaces of negative or positive fractional order. An enhanced, fresh new look at symmetrizable linear transforms enters into the picture in the company of geometric-microlocal analysis techniques. The outcome is manyfold, complementing recent advances on the theory of layer potentials, in the smooth boundary setting.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for Solvability of Operators of Subprincipal Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that condition $\operatorname{Sub_r}(\Psi)$ on the subprincipal symbol is sufficient for local solvability of pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type. These are the operators having real principal symbol which vanish on an involutive manifold where the subprincipal symbol is of principal type. This condition has previously been shown by the author to be necessary for local solvability of pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type.</description>

      <title>Stability of solutions of the porous medium equation with growth with respect to the diffusion exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a macroscopic model for the growth of living tissues incorporating pressure-driven dispersal and pressure-modulated proliferation. Assuming a power-law relation between the mechanical pressure and the cell density, the model can be expressed as the porous medium equation with a growth term. We prove H\"older continuous dependence of the solutions of the model on the diffusion exponent. The main difficulty lies in the degeneracy of the porous medium equations at vacuum. To deal with this issue, we first regularise the equation by shifting the initial data away from zero and then optimise the stability estimate derived in the regular setting.</description>

      <title>Local smoothing for the Hermite wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show local smoothing estimates in $L^p$-spaces for solutions to the Hermite wave equation. For this purpose, we obtain a parametrix given by a Fourier Integral Operator, which we linearize. This leads us to analyze local smoothing estimates for solutions to Klein-Gordon equations. We show $\ell^2$-decoupling estimates adapted to the mass parameter to obtain local smoothing with essentially sharp derivative loss. In one dimension as consequence of square function estimates, we obtain estimates sharp up to endpoints. Finally, we elaborate on the implications of local smoothing estimates for Hermite Bochner--Riesz means.</description>

      <title>Long-time dynamics of a competition model with nonlocal diffusion and free boundaries: Vanishing and spreading of the invader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the long-time dynamics of a two species competition model of Lotka-Volterra type with nonlocal diffusions. One of the species, with density $v(t,x)$, is assumed to be a native in the environment (represented by the real line $\R$), while the other species, with density $u(t,x)$, is an invading species which invades the territory of $v$ with two fronts, $x=g(t)$ on the left and $x=h(t)$ on the right. So the population range of $u$ is the evolving interval $[g(t), h(t)]$ and the reaction-diffusion equation for $u$ has two free boundaries, with $g(t)$ decreasing in $t$ and $h(t)$ increasing in $t$, and the limits $h_\infty:=h(\infty)\leq \infty$ and $g_\infty:=g(\infty)\geq -\infty$ thus always exist. We obtain detailed descriptions of the long-time dynamics of the model according to whether $h_\infty-g_\infty$ is $\infty$ or finite. In the latter case, we reveal in what sense the invader $u$ vanishes in the long run and $v$ survives the invasion, while in the former case, we obtain a rather satisfactory description of the long-time asymptotic limit for both $u(t,x)$ and $v(t,x)$ when a certain parameter $k$ in the model is less than 1. This research is continued in a separate work, where sharp criteria are obtained to distinguish the case $h_\infty-g_\infty=\infty$ from the case $h_\infty-g_\infty$ is finite, and new phenomena are revealed for the case $k\geq 1$. The techniques developed in this paper should have applications to other models with nonlocal diffusion and free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Long-time dynamics of a competition model with nonlocal diffusion and free boundaries: Chances of successful invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our work \cite{dns-part1} to investigate the long-time dynamics of a two species competition model of Lotka-Volterra type with nonlocal diffusions, where the territory (represented by the real line $\R$) of a native species with density $v(t,x)$, is invaded by a competitor with density $u(t,x)$, via two fronts, $x=g(t)$ on the left and $x=h(t)$ on the right. So the population range of $u$ is the evolving interval $[g(t), h(t)]$ and the reaction-diffusion equation for $u$ has two free boundaries, with $g(t)$ decreasing in $t$ and $h(t)$ increasing in $t$. Let $h_\infty:=h(\infty)\leq \infty$ and $g_\infty:=g(\infty)\geq -\infty$. In \cite{dns-part1}, we obtained detailed descriptions of the long-time dynamics of the model according to whether $h_\infty-g_\infty$ is $\infty$ or finite. In the latter case, we demonstrated in what sense the invader $u$ vanishes in the long run and $v$ survives the invasion, while in the former case, we obtained a rather satisfactory description of the long-time asymptotic limits of $u(t,x)$ and $v(t,x)$ when the parameter $k$ in the model is less than 1. In the current paper, we obtain sharp criteria to distinguish the case $h_\infty-g_\infty=\infty$ from the case $h_\infty-g_\infty$ is finite. Moreover, for the case $k\geq 1$ and $u$ is a weak competitor, we obtain biologically meaningful conditions that guarantee the vanishing of the invader $u$, and reveal chances for $u$ to invade successfully. In particular, we demonstrate that both $h_\infty=\infty=-g_\infty$ and $h_\infty=\infty$ but $g_\infty$ is finite are possible; the latter seems to be the first example for this kind of population models, with either local or nonlocal diffusion.</description>

Abstract: The problem of obtaining the lower bounds on the restriction of Laplacian eigenfunctions to hypersurfaces inside a compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is challenging and has been attempted by many authors \cite{BR, GRS, Jun, ET}. This paper aims to show that if $(M,g)$ is assumed to be a negatively curved surface then one can get the corresponding restricted lower bounds, as well as quantitative improvement of restricted bounds for Neumann data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of  two-dimensional interacting fermions submitted to a homogeneous transverse magnetic field. We consider a large magnetic field regime, with the gap between Landau levels set to the same order as that of potential energy contributions. Within the mean-field approximation, i.e. starting from Hartree's equation for the first reduced density matrix, we derive a drift equation for the particle density. We use vortex coherent states and the associated Husimi function to define a semi-classical density almost satisfying the limiting equation. We then deduce convergence of the density of the true Hartree solution by a Dobrushin-type stability estimate for the limiting equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show existence, uniqueness and positivity for the Green's function of the operator $(\Delta_g + \alpha)^k$ in a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, of dimension $n&gt;2k$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, $k\geq 1$, with Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_g = -\operatorname{div}_g(\nabla \cdot)$, and where $\alpha &gt;0$. We are interested in the case where $\alpha$ is large : We prove pointwise estimates with explicit dependence on $\alpha$ for the Green's function and its derivatives. We highlight a region of exponential decay for the Green's function away from the diagonal, for large $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>On the nonlinear thin obstacle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thin obstacle problem or $n$-dimensional Signorini problem is a classical variational problem arising in several applications, starting with its first introduction in elasticity theory. The vast literature concerns mostly quadratic energies, whereas only partial results have been proved in the nonlinear case. In this paper we consider the thin boundary obstacle problem for a general class of nonlineraities and we prove the optimal $C^{1, \frac{1}{2}}$-regularity of the solutions in any space dimension.</description>

      <title>Existence of a global fundamental solution for H\"ormander operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a simply connected manifold $M$ - and a vast class of non-simply connected manifolds - the existence of a fundamental solution for a differential operator $\mathcal L=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb N^q} r_\alpha\cdot X^\alpha$ of finite degree over $M$, follows via a saturation method from the existence of a fundamental solution for the associated "lifted" operator over a group $G$. Given some smooth complete vector fields $X_1,\dots, X_q$ on $M$, suppose that they generate a finite dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ satisfying the H\"ormander's condition. The simply connected Lie group $G$ is the unique such that $\mbox{Lie}(G)\cong\mathfrak g$. It has the property that a right $G$-action exists over $M$, faithful and transitive, inducing a natural projection $E\colon G\to M$. We generalize an approach developed by Biagi and Bonfiglioli. In particular we represent the group $G$ as a direct product $M\times G^z$ where the model fiber $G^z$ has a group structure. Our approach doesn't need any nilpotency hypothesis on the group $G$, therefore it broadens the spectrum of cases where techniques of the kind "lifting and approximation", as those introduce by the works of Rothschild, Stein, Goodman, can be applied.</description>

      <title>Type problem, the first eigenvalue and Hardy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between the type problem and the asymptotic behaviour of the first (Dirichlet) eigenvalues $\lambda_1(B_r)$ of ``balls'' $B_r:=\{\rho&lt;r\}$ on a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ as $r\rightarrow +\infty$, where $\rho$ is a Lipschitz continuous exhaustion function with $|\nabla\rho|\leq1$ a.e. on $M$. We obtain several sharp results. First, if for all $r&gt;r_0$ \[ r^2 \lambda_1(B_r)\ge \gamma&gt;0, \] we obtain a sharp estimate of the volume growth: $|B_r|\ge cr^{\mu(\gamma)}.$ Moreover when $\gamma&gt;j_0^2\approx 5.784$, where $j_0$ denotes the first positive zero of the Bessel function $J_0$, then $M$ is hyperbolic and we have a Hardy type inequality. In the case where $r_0=0$, a sharp Hardy type inequality holds. These spectral conditions are satisfied if one assumes that $\Delta\rho^2\geq2\mu(\gamma)&gt;0$. In particular, when $\inf_M\Delta\rho^2&gt;4$, $M$ is hyperbolic and we get a sharp Hardy type inequality. Related results for finite volume case are also studied.</description>

      <title>On potentials whose level sets are orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A level orbit of a mechanical Hamiltonian system is a solution of Newton equation that is contained in a level set of the potential energy. In 2003, Mark Levi asked for a characterization of the smooth potential energy functions on the plane with the property that any point on the plane lies on a level orbit; we call such functions Levi potentials. The basic examples are the radial monotone increasing smooth functions. In this paper we show that any Levi potential that is analytic or has totally path-disconnected critical set must be radial. Nevertheless, we show that every compact convex subset of the plane is the critical set of a Levi potential. A crucial observation for these theorems is that, outside the critical set, the family of level sets of a Levi potential forms a solution of the inverse curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Carleman estimates for space semi-discrete approximations of one-dimensional stochastic parabolic equation and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study discrete Carleman estimates for space semi-discrete approximations of one-dimensional stochastic parabolic equation. As applications of these discrete Carleman estimates, we apply them to study two inverse problems for the spatial semi-discrete stochastic parabolic equations, including a discrete inverse random source problem and a discrete Cauchy problem. We firstly establish two Carleman estimates for a one-dimensional semi-discrete stochastic parabolic equation, one for homogeneous boundary and the other for non-homogeneous boundary. Then we apply these two estimates separately to derive two stability results. The first one is the Lipschitz stability for the discrete inverse random source problem. The second one is the H\"{o}lder stability for the discrete Cauchy problem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of stochastic kinetic solutions introduced in arXiv:2108.08858 to establish the well-posedness of stochastic kinetic solutions of generalized Dean-Kawasaki equations with correlated noise on bounded, $C^2$-domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The results apply to a wide class of non-negative boundary data, which is based on certain a priori estimates for the solutions, that encompasses all non-negative constant functions including zero and all smooth functions bounded away from zero.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the imaginary parts of scattering resonances for negatively curved asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces are uniformly bounded away from zero and provide a resolvent bound in the resulting resonance-free strip. This provides an essential spectral gap without the pressure condition. This is done by adapting the methods of [arXiv:1004.3361], [arXiv:1012.4391] and [arXiv:2201.08259] and answers a question posed in [arXiv:1504.06589].</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.10511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a version of Hironaka's resolution of singularities for real-analytic functions, any elliptic multiplier $\mathrm{Op}(p)$ of order $d&gt;0$, real-analytic near $p^{-1}(0)$, has a fundamental solution $\mu_0$. We give an integral representation of $\mu_0$ in terms of the resolutions supplied by Hironaka's theorem. This $\mu_0$ is weakly approximated in $H^t_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $t&lt;d-\frac{n}{2}$ by a sequence from a Paley-Wiener space. In special cases of global symmetry, the obtained integral representation can be made fully explicit, and we use this to compute fundamental solutions for two non-polynomial symbols.</description>

      <title>On microlocalisation and the construction of Feynman Propagators for normally hyperbolic operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article gives global microlocalisation constructions for normally hyperbolic operators on a vector bundle over a globally hyperbolic spacetime in geometric terms. As an application, this is used to generalise the Duistermaat-H\"{o}rmander construction of Feynman propagators, therefore incorporating the most important non-scalar geometric operators. It is shown that for normally hyperbolic operators that are selfadjoint with respect to a hermitian bundle metric, the Feynman propagators can be constructed to satisfy a positivity property that reflects the existence of Hadamard states in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. We also give a more direct construction of the Feynman propagators for Dirac-type operators on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Even though the natural bundle metric on spinors is not positive-definite, in this case, we can give a direct microlocal construction of a Feynman propagator that satisfies positivity.</description>

Abstract: Given small initial solutions of the nonlinear quantum harmonic oscillator on $\mathbb{R}$, we are interested in their long time behavior in the energy space which is an adapted Sobolev space. We perturbate the linear part by $V$ taken as multiplicative potentials, in a way that the linear frequencies satisfy a non-resonance condition. More precisely, we prove that for almost all potentials $V$, the low modes of the solution are almost preserved for very long times.</description>

Abstract: We show by a formal asymptotic expansion that level sets of solutions of a time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation evolve by a geometric flow whose normal velocity is a positive power of the mean curvature.
  This connection is quite intriguing, since the original equation is nonlocal and the evolution of its solutions depends on all previous states, but the associated geometric flow is of purely local type, with no memory effect involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the global-time existence of weak solutions to the supercooled Stefan problem. Our result holds in general space dimensions and with a general class of initial data. In addition, our solution is maximal in the sense of a certain stochastic order, among all comparable weak solutions starting from the same initial data. Our approach is based on a free target optimization problem for Brownian stopping times, where the main idea is to introduce a superharmonic cost function in the optimization problem. We will show that our choice of the cost function causes the target measure to accumulate near the prescribed domain boundary as much as possible. A central ingredient in our proof lies in the usage of dual problem: we prove the dual attainment and use the dual optimal solution to characterize the primal optimal solution. It follows in turn that the underlying particle dynamics yields a solution to the supercooled Stefan problem.</description>

Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of fundamental solution operators to Kolmo\-gorov-Fokker-Planck equations with rough (measurable) coefficients and local or integral diffusion on finite and infinite time strips. In the local case, that is to say when the diffusion operator is of differential type, we prove $\L^2$ decay using Davies' method and the conservation property. We also prove that the existence of a generalized fundamental solution with the expected pointwise Gaussian upper bound is equivalent to Moser's $\L^2-\L^\infty$ estimates for local weak solutions to the equation and its adjoint.  When coefficients are real, this gives the existence and uniqueness of such a generalized fundamental solution and a new and natural way to obtain pointwise decay.</description>

      <title>The relative isoperimetric inequality for minimal submanifolds with free boundary in the Euclidean space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.00914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider the relative isoperimetric inequalities for minimal submanifolds with free boundary. We first generalize ideas of restricted normal cones introduced by Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e in \cite{CGR06} and obtain an optimal area estimate for generalized restricted normal cones. This area estimate, together with the ABP method of Cabr\'e in \cite{Cabre2008}, provides a new proof of the relative isoperimetric inequality obtained by Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e in \cite{CGR07}. Furthermore, we use this estimate and the idea of Brendle in his recent work \cite{Brendle2019} to obtain a relative isoperimetric inequality for minimal submanifolds with free boundary on a convex support surface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$, which is optimal and gives an affirmative answer to an open problem proposed by Choe in \cite{Choe2005}, Open Problem 12.6, when the codimension $m\leq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a uniqueness result for the broken ray transform acting on the sums of functions and $1$-forms on surfaces in the presence of an external force and a reflecting obstacle. We assume that the considered twisted geodesic flows have nonpositive curvature. The broken rays are generated from the twisted geodesic flows by the law of reflection on the boundary of a suitably convex obstacle. Our work generalizes recent results for the broken geodesic ray transform on surfaces to more general families of curves including the magnetic flows and Gaussian thermostats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the number of nodal domains of eigenfunctions of sub-Laplacians on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we investigate the validity of Pleijel's theorem, which states that, as soon as the dimension is strictly larger than 1, the number of nodal domains of an eigenfunction corresponding to the k-th eigenvalue is strictly (and uniformly, in a certain sense) smaller than k for large k.
  In the first part of this paper we reduce this question from the case of general sub-Riemannian manifolds to that of nilpotent groups.
  In the second part, we analyze in detail the case where the nilpotent group is a Heisenberg group times a Euclidean space. Along the way we improve known bounds on the optimal constants in the Faber-Krahn and isoperimetric inequalities on these groups.</description>

Abstract: Using the weak convergence approach, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for solutions to quasilinear stochastic evolution equations with small Gaussian noise in the critical variational setting, a recently developed general variational framework. No additional assumptions are made apart from those required for well-posedness. In particular, no monotonicity is required, nor a compact embedding in the Gelfand triple. Moreover, we allow for flexible growth of the diffusion coefficient, including gradient noise. This leads to numerous applications for which the LDP was not established yet, in particular equations on unbounded domains with gradient noise.</description>
