      <title>When invariance implies exchangeability (and applications to invariant Keisler measures)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of when, given a homogeneous structure $M$ and a space $S$ of expansions of $M$, every $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant probability measure on $S$ is exchangeable (i.e. $S_\infty$-invariant). We define a condition of $k$-overlap closedness on $M$ which implies exchangeability of random expansions by a class of structures whose finite substructures are all contained in a hereditary class with labelled growth-rate $O(e^{n^{k+\delta}})$ for all $\delta&gt;0$. For example, the generic tetrahedron-free $3$-hypergraph is $2$-overlap closed and so all of its random expansions by graphs are exchangeable. Our more general results on $k$-overlap closedness for homogeneous structures imply the same for every finitely bounded homogeneous $3$-hypergraph with free amalgamation. Our results extend and recover both the work of Angel, Kechris and Lyons on invariant random orderings of homogeneous structures and some of the work of Crane and Towsner, and Ackerman on relatively exchangeable structures. We also study conditions under which there are non-exchangeable invariant random expansions looking at the universal homogeneous kay-graphs.
  In the second part of the paper we apply our results to study invariant Keisler measures in homogeneous structures. We prove that invariant Keisler measures can be viewed as a particular kind of invariant random expansion. Thus, we describe the spaces of invariant Keisler measures of various homogeneous structures, obtaining the first results of this kind since the work of Albert and Ensley. We also show there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ supersimple homogeneous ternary structures for which there are non-forking formulas which are universally measure zero.</description>

      <title>Weyl's Quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper argues that Weyl's interpretation of quantified formulas should not be conflated with Hilbert's. The epistemic obligation to judge correctly, to which Weyl was deeply committed, suggests an interpretation of quantified formulas as generating deontic obligations to act in ways that expand the repository of correct judgments. This justifies the claim that Weyl conceived of transfinite mathematics as a normative system - a normative extension of elementary mathematics, and clarifies his semantic reasons for rejecting the law of excluded middle.</description>

      <title>Complete representation by partial functions for signatures containing antidomain restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate notions of complete representation by partial functions, where the operations in the signature include antidomain restriction and may include composition, intersection, update, preferential union, domain, antidomain, and set difference. When the signature includes both antidomain restriction and intersection, the join-complete and the meet-complete representations coincide. Otherwise, for the signatures we consider, meet-complete is strictly stronger than join-complete. A necessary condition to be meet-completely representable is that the atoms are separating. For the signatures we consider, this condition is sufficient if and only if composition is not in the signature. For each of the signatures we consider, the class of (meet-)completely representable algebras is not axiomatisable by any existential-universal-existential first-order theory. For 14 expressively distinct signatures, we show, by giving an explicit representation, that the (meet-)completely representable algebras form a basic elementary class, axiomatisable by a universal-existential-universal first-order sentence. The signatures we axiomatise are those containing antidomain restriction and any of intersection, update, and preferential union and also those containing antidomain restriction, composition, and intersection and any of update, preferential union, domain, and antidomain.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Kan extensions along 2-fibrations and the 2-category of elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 2-category of elements from an abstract point of view. We generalize to dimension 2 the well-known result that the category of elements can be captured by a comma object that also exhibits a pointwise left Kan extension. For this, we propose an original definition of pointwise Kan extension along a discrete 2-opfibration in the lax 3-category of 2-categories, 2-functors, lax natural transformations and modifications. Such definition uses cartesian-marked lax limits, which are an alternative to weighted 2-limits. We show that a pointwise Kan extension along a discrete 2-opfibration is always a weak one as well. The proof is based on an original generalization of the parametrized Yoneda lemma which is as lax as it can be.</description>

      <title>Relative injective modules, superstability and noetherian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02456v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classes of modules closed under direct sums, $\mathcal{M}$-submodules and $\mathcal{M}$-epimorphic images where $\mathcal{M}$ is either the class of embeddings, $RD$-embeddings or pure embeddings.
  We show that the $\mathcal{M}$-injective modules of theses classes satisfy a Baer-like criterion. In particular, injective modules, $RD$-injective modules, pure injective modules, flat cotorsion modules and $\mathfrak{s}$-torsion pure injective modules satisfy this criterion. The argument presented is a model theoretic one. We use in an essential way stable independence relations which generalize Shelah's non-forking to abstract elementary classes.
  We show that the classical model theoretic notion of superstability is equivalent to the algebraic notion of a noetherian category for these classes. We use this equivalence to characterize noetherian rings, pure semisimple rings, perfect rings and finite products of finite rings and artinian valuation rings via superstability.</description>

      <title>Categorical Framework for Typed Extensional and Intensional Models in Formal Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensional computation derives concrete outputs from abstract function definitions; extensional computation defines functions through explicit input-output pairs. In formal semantics: intensional computation interprets expressions as context-dependent functions; extensional computation evaluates expressions based on their denotations in an otherwise fixed context. This paper reformulates typed extensional and intensional models of formal semantics within a category-theoretic framework and demonstrates their natural representation therein. We construct $\textbf{ModInt}$, the category of intensional models, building on the categories $\textbf{Set}$ of sets, $\textbf{Rel}$ of relations, and $\textbf{Kr}$ and $\textbf{Kr}_\textbf{b}$ of Kripke frames with monotone maps and bounded morphisms, respectively. We prove that trivial intensional models are equivalent to extensional models, providing a unified categorical representation of intensionality and extensionality in formal semantics. This approach reinterprets the relationship between intensions and extensions in a categorical framework and offers a modular, order-independent method for processing intensions and recovering extensions; contextualizing the relationship between content and reference in category-theoretic terms. We discuss implications for natural language semantics and propose future directions for contextual integration and exploring $\textbf{ModInt}$'s algebraic properties.</description>
