Abstract: Cells continuously interact with their environment mediating their responses through signaling cascades. Very often, external stimuli induce pulsatile behaviors in intermediaries of the cascade of increasing frequency with the stimulus strength. This is characteristic of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals involving Ca$^{2+}$ release through Inositol Trisphosphate Receptors (IP$_3$Rs). The mean frequency of IP$_3$R-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ pulses has been observed to scale exponentially with the stimulus strength in many cell types. In this paper we use a simple ODE model of the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics for parameters for which there is one excitable fixed point. Including fluctuations through an additive noise term, we derive the mean escape rate from the stationary state and, thus, the mean interpulse time, as a function of the fraction, $\beta$, of readily openable IP$_3$Rs. Using an IP$_3$R kinetic model, experimental observations of spatially resolved Ca$^{2+}$ signals and previous estimates of the IP$_3$ produced upon stimulation we quantify the fluctuations and relate $\beta$ to [IP$_3$] and the stimulus strength. In this way we determine that the mean interpulse time can be approximated by an exponential function of the latter for ranges such that the covered mean time intervals are similar or larger than those observed experimentally. The study thus provides an easily interpretable explanation, applicable to other pulsatile signaling intermediaries, of the observed exponential dependence between frequency and stimulus, a key feature that makes frequency encoding qualitatively different from other ways commonly used by cells to "read" their environment.</description>
