      <title>Dynamical friction and measurements of the splashback radius in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The splashback radius is one popular method to constrain the size of galaxy clusters. It is typically measured through the logarithmic derivative of the galaxy number density profile, since doing so is more observationally viable and computationally inexpensive compared to other methods. However, measuring the splashback radius through the galaxy number density has consistently produced smaller values of the splashback radius than those measured with dark matter density or other processes. Dynamical friction has been posited as one possible reason that splashback radii measured through galaxy number densities are reduced, since it decays the orbits of subhaloes within the halo, however, the effects of dynamical friction cannot be isolated within cosmological simulations. Here, we present idealized simulations starting with isolated galaxy clusters drawn from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where we isolate dynamical friction. We show that although dynamical friction can reduce measurements of the splashback radius, it does not have a significant effect on clusters with $M_\mathrm{200,mean} &gt; 10^{14} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, and thus cannot completely account for previously measured discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Constraining the primordial black hole abundance through Big-Bang nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario in which primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses Mpbh &lt; 10^9 g undergo Hawking evaporation, around the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) epoch. The evaporation process modifies the Universe's expansion rate and the baryon-to-photon ratio, leading to an alteration of the primordial abundance of light nuclei. We present numerical solutions for the set of equations describing this physics, considering different values of PBH masses and abundances at their formation, showing how their evaporation impacts the abundances of light nuclei, obtained by incorporating the non-standard Hubble rate and baryon-to-photon ratio into the BBN code PArthENoPE. The results are then used to place upper bounds for the PBH relative abundance at formation in the range 10^8 g &lt; Mpbh &lt; 10^9 g, providing the strongest constraints existing to-date in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological analyses of HI clustering by reducing stochastic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-number-density tracers of large-scale structure, such as the HI-rich galaxies measured by 21 cm intensity mapping, have low sampling noise, making them particularly promising as cosmological probes. At large scales, this sampling noise can be subdominant to other scale-independent contributions to the power spectrum, arising from nonlinear bias. This has important consequences for cosmological constraints obtained from such tracers, since it indicates that using the power spectrum does not lead to optimal constraints even in the linear regime. In this paper, we provide a conservative estimate of the possible improvement in constraining power of a 21cm survey if one were to use an optimal analysis strategy (such as field-level analysis), where only the true sampling noise enters the error budget. We find that improvements in uncertainties on some cosmological parameters can be as large as 50%, depending on redshift, foreground cleaning efficiency, scales used in the analysis, and instrumental noise. One byproduct of our work is measurements of bias parameters and stochasticity for neutral hydrogen in the IllustrisTNG simulation over a wide range of redshifts; we provide simple fitting formulas for these measurements. Our results motivate further exploration of new optimal analysis techniques and provide important insights into the constraining power of current and future 21 cm surveys.</description>

      <title>DESI Constraints on Exponential Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DESI collaboration have recently analyzed their first year of data, finding a preference for thawing dark energy scenarios when using parameterized equations of state for dark energy. We investigate whether this preference persists when the data is analyzed within the context of a well-studied field theory model of thawing dark energy, exponential quintessence. No preference for this model over $\Lambda$CDM is found, and both models are poorer fits to the data than the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $w_0$--$w_a$ parameterization. We demonstrate that the worse fit is due to a lack of sharp features in the potential that results in a slowly-evolving dark energy equation of state that does not have enough freedom to simultaneously fit the combination of the supernovae, DESI, and cosmic microwave background data. Our analysis provides guidance for constructing dynamical dark energy models that are able to better accommodate the data.</description>

      <title>A short review on joint weak and strong cluster lens-mass reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The divide between weak and strong lensing is of course artificial, in that both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, with different methods. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be needed. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so, since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward. The silence of the literature on this latter point is in fact somewhat surprising.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a short account, based on a talk given at the 2024 Moriond Cosmology Conference, of where and why string theory matters in early universe cosmology. It is written for a cosmology audience predisposed to be at best sceptical, and at worst contemptuous, of the notion that either quantum gravity or string theory has any relevance for their discipline. I cover inflation, CMB tensor modes, extended kination or tracker epochs and reheating.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference post DESI DR1 BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we implement Gaussian process regression to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe in a model-agnostic manner, using the Pantheon-Plus SN-Ia compilation in combination with two different BAO measurements (SDSS-IV and DESI DR1). In both the reconstructions, the $\Lambda$CDM model is always included in the 95\% confidence intervals. We find evidence that the DESI LRG data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ is not an outlier within our model-independent framework. We study the $\mathcal{O}m$-diagnostics and the evolution of the total equation of state (EoS) of our universe, which hint towards the possibility of a quintessence-like dark energy scenario with a very slowly varying EoS, and a phantom-crossing in higher $z$. The entire exercise is later complemented by considering two more SN-Ia compilations - DES-5YR and Union3 - in combination with DESI BAO. Reconstruction with the DESI BAO + DES-5YR SN data sets predicts that the $\Lambda$CDM model lies outside the 3$\sigma$ confidence levels, whereas with DESI BAO + Union3 data, the $\Lambda$CDM model is always included within 1$\sigma$. We also report constraints on $H_0 r_d$ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the pre-recombination physics. Our results point towards an $\approx$ 2$\sigma$ discrepancy between the DESI + Pantheon-Plus and DESI + DES-5YR data sets, which calls for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Black Holes in Slow-reheating Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After primordial inflation, the universe may have experienced a prolonged reheating epoch, potentially leading to a phase of matter domination supported by the oscillating inflaton field. During such an epoch, perturbations in the inflaton virialize upon reentering the cosmological horizon, forming inflaton structures. If the primordial overdensities are sufficiently large, these structures collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). To occur at a significant rate, this process requires an enhanced primordial power spectrum (PPS) at small scales. The enhancement of the PPS, as well as the formation and tidal interaction of the primordial structures, will in turn source a stochastic gravitational wave background(SGWB) that could be detected by current and/or future gravitational wave detectors. In this paper, we study the SGWB arising from these different sources during slow-reheating, focusing on a PPS that satisfies the requirements necessary for the formation of PBHs with a mass of $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq 10^{21}$ and that constitute the entirety of dark matter in the universe.</description>

      <title>Archetype-Based Redshift Estimation for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient galaxy archetype-based redshift estimation and spectral classification method for the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI) survey. The DESI survey currently relies on a redshift fitter and spectral classifier using a linear combination of PCA-derived templates, which is very efficient in processing large volumes of DESI spectra within a short time frame. However, this method occasionally yields unphysical model fits for galaxies and fails to adequately absorb calibration errors that may still be occasionally visible in the reduced spectra. Our proposed approach improves upon this existing method by refitting the spectra with carefully generated physical galaxy archetypes combined with additional terms designed to absorb data reduction defects and provide more physical models to the DESI spectra. We test our method on an extensive dataset derived from the survey validation (SV) and Year 1 (Y1) data of DESI. Our findings indicate that the new method delivers marginally better redshift success for SV tiles while reducing catastrophic redshift failure by $10-30\%$. At the same time, results from millions of targets from the main survey show that our model has relatively higher redshift success and purity rates ($0.5-0.8\%$ higher) for galaxy targets while having similar success for QSOs. These improvements also demonstrate that the main DESI redshift pipeline is generally robust. Additionally, it reduces the false positive redshift estimation by $5-40\%$ for sky fibers. We also discuss the generic nature of our method and how it can be extended to other large spectroscopic surveys, along with possible future improvements.</description>

      <title>Dust dynamics in RAMSES -- II. Equilibrium drift velocity distributions of charged dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18463v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gas-grain relative drift velocity distributions of charged astrophysical dust grains in MHD turbulence. We do this using a range of MHD-PIC simulations spanning different plasma-$\beta$, sonic/Alfv\'en Mach number, and with grains of varying size and charge-to-mass ratio. We find that the root-mean-square drift velocity is a strong function of the grain size, following a power law with a 1/2 slope. The r.m.s. value has only a very weak dependence on the charge-to-mass ratio. On the other hand, the shape of the distribution is a strong function of the grain charge-to-mass ratio, and in compressible turbulence, also the grain size. We then compare these results to simple analytic models based upon time-domain quasi-linear theory and solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. These models explain qualitatively the r.m.s. drift velocity's lack of charge-to-mass ratio dependence, as well as why the shape of the distribution changes as the charge-to-mass ratio increases. Finally we scale our results to astrophysical conditions. As an example, at a length scale of one parsec in the cold neutral medium, 0.1 $\mu$m grains should be drifting at roughly 40% of the turbulent velocity dispersion. These findings may serve as a basis for a model for grain velocities in the context of grain-grain collisions, non-thermal sputtering, and accretion of metals. These findings also have implications for the transport of grains through the galaxy, suggesting that grains may have non-negligible random motions at length-scales that many modern galaxy simulations approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WIMP-type dark matter may have additional interactions that break baryon number, leading to induced nucleon decays which are subject to direct experimental constraints from proton decay experiments. In this work, we analyze a possibility of continuous baryon destruction, deriving strong limits from the dark matter accumulating inside old neutron stars, as such a process leads to excess heat generation. We construct the simplest particle dark matter model that breaks baryon and lepton numbers separately but conserves $B-L$. Virtual exchange by DM particles in this model results in di-nucleon decay via $nn\to n\bar\nu$ and $np\to ne^+$ processes.</description>

      <title>Candidate strongly-lensed Type Ia supernovae in the Zwicky Transient Facility archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) are unique astronomical tools for studying cosmological parameters, distributions of dark matter, the astrophysics of the supernovae and the intervening lensing galaxies themselves. Only a few highly magnified glSNe Ia have been discovered by ground-based telescopes, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), but simulations predict the existence of a fainter, undetected population. We present a systematic search in the ZTF archive of alerts from 1 June 2019 to 1 September 2022. Using the AMPEL platform, we developed a pipeline that distinguishes candidate glSNe Ia from other variable sources. Initial cuts were applied to the ZTF alert photometry before forced photometry was obtained for the remaining candidates. Additional cuts were applied to refine the candidates based on their light curve colours, lens galaxy colours, and the resulting parameters from fits to the SALT2 SN Ia template. Candidates were also cross-matched with the DESI spectroscopic catalogue. Seven transients passed all the cuts and had an associated galaxy DESI redshift, which we present as glSN Ia candidates. While superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) cannot be fully rejected, two events, ZTF19abpjicm and ZTF22aahmovu, are significantly different from typical SLSNe and their light curves can be modelled as two-image glSN Ia systems. From this two-image modelling, we estimate time delays of 22 $\pm$ 3 and 34 $\pm$ 1 days for the two events, respectively, which suggests that we have uncovered a population with longer time delays. The pipeline is efficient and sensitive enough to parse full alert streams. It is currently being applied to the live ZTF alert stream to identify and follow-up future candidates while active. This pipeline could be the foundation for glSNe Ia searches in future surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Low-Mass Galaxy Interactions Trigger Black Hole Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of high-$z$ over-massive supermassive black holes represents a major conundrum in our understanding of black hole evolution. In this paper, we probe from the observational point of view how early Universe environmental conditions could have acted as an evolutionary mechanism for the accelerated growth of the first black holes. Under the assumption that the early Universe is dominated by dwarf galaxies, we investigate the hypothesis that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions trigger black hole accretion. We present the discovery of 82 dwarf-dwarf galaxy pairs and 11 dwarf galaxy groups using the Hubble Space Telescope, doubling existing samples. The dwarf systems span a redshift range of 0.13$&lt;$z$&lt;$1.5, and a stellar mass range of 7.24$&lt;$log(M$_*$/\(M_\odot\))$&lt;$9.73. We performed an X-ray study of a subset of these dwarf systems with Chandra and detected six new AGN, increasing the number of known dwarf-dwarf-merger-related AGN from one to seven. We then compared the frequency of these AGN in grouped/paired dwarfs to that of isolated dwarfs and found a statistically significant enhancement (4$\sigma$-6$\sigma$) in the interacting sample. This study, the first of its kind at the lowest mass scales, implies that the presence of a nearby dwarf neighbor is efficient in triggering black hole accretion. These results open new avenues for indirect studies of the emergence of the first supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>The discovery and significance of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2007 we were part of a team that discovered the so-called ``Lorimer Burst'', the first example of a new class of objects now known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). These enigmatic events are only a few ms in duration and occur at random locations on the sky at a rate of a few thousand per day. Several thousand FRBs are currently known. While it is now well established that they have a cosmological origin, and about 10\% of all currently known sources have been seen to exhibit multiple bursts, the origins of these enigmatic sources are currently poorly understood. In this article, we review the discovery of FRBs and present some of the highlights from the vast body of work by an international community. Following a brief overview of the scale of the visible Universe in \S 1, we describe the key moments in radio astronomy (\S 2) that led up to the discovery of the Lorimer burst (\S 3). Early efforts to find more FRBs are described in \S 4 which led to the discovery of the first repeating source (\S 5). In \S 6, as we close out on the second decade of FRBs, we outline some of the many open questions in the field and look ahead to the coming years where many surprises are surely in store.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Giant Radio Galaxies' (GRGs)-some of the largest structures powered by supermassive black holes-prevalence within supercluster environments and the influence of such environments on their properties. Utilising two large catalogues of superclusters (401) and GRGs (1446), we establish the existence of 77 GRGs (5.3%) residing in 64 superclusters (16%) within $\rm 0.05 \leq z \leq 0.42$. Among the 77 GRGs found in superclusters, we identify $\sim$70% as residing within galaxy clusters. Within the subset of GRGs not located in superclusters, which constitutes 94.7% of the sample, a mere 21% are associated with galaxy clusters, while the remaining majority are situated in sparser environments. We examine the influence of differing environments -such as cluster versus non-cluster and supercluster versus non-supercluster regions -on the size of GRGs while also exploring the driving factors behind their overall growth. Our findings show that the largest GRGs ($\gtrsim$3 Mpc) grow in underdense environments beyond the confines of dense environments. Moreover, we show that $\sim$ 24% of 1446 GRGs reside in galaxy clusters. We conclude that GRGs preferentially grow in sparser regions of the cosmic web and have a significantly larger median size. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of GRGs as astrophysical probes with specific cases where GRGs, exhibiting polarised emissions and located behind superclusters (acting as natural Faraday screens), were used to estimate magnetic field strengths of the supercluster environment at sub-micro Gauss levels.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A Measurement of the DR6 CMB Lensing Power Spectrum and its Implications for Structure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing over $9400$ sq. deg. of the sky. These lensing measurements are derived from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) CMB dataset, which consists of five seasons of ACT CMB temperature and polarization observations. We determine the amplitude of the CMB lensing power spectrum at $2.3\%$ precision ($43\sigma$ significance) using a novel pipeline that minimizes sensitivity to foregrounds and to noise properties. To ensure our results are robust, we analyze an extensive set of null tests, consistency tests, and systematic error estimates and employ a blinded analysis framework. The baseline spectrum is well fit by a lensing amplitude of $A_{\mathrm{lens}}=1.013\pm0.023$ relative to the Planck 2018 CMB power spectra best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model and $A_{\mathrm{lens}}=1.005\pm0.023$ relative to the $\text{ACT DR4} + \text{WMAP}$ best-fit model. From our lensing power spectrum measurement, we derive constraints on the parameter combination $S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \left({\Omega_m}/{0.3}\right)^{0.25}$ of $S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8= 0.818\pm0.022$ from ACT DR6 CMB lensing alone and $S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8= 0.813\pm0.018$ when combining ACT DR6 and Planck NPIPE CMB lensing power spectra. These results are in excellent agreement with $\Lambda$CDM model constraints from Planck or $\text{ACT DR4} + \text{WMAP}$ CMB power spectrum measurements. Our lensing measurements from redshifts $z\sim0.5$--$5$ are thus fully consistent with $\Lambda$CDM structure growth predictions based on CMB anisotropies probing primarily $z\sim1100$. We find no evidence for a suppression of the amplitude of cosmic structure at low redshifts</description>

      <title>Complete analysis of the background and anisotropies of scalar-induced gravitational waves: primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ considered</title>

Abstract: Investigation of primordial non-Gaussianity holds immense importance in testing the inflation paradigm and shedding light on the physics of the early Universe. In this study, we conduct the complete analysis of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) by incorporating the local-type non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$. We develop Feynman-like diagrammatic technique and derive semi-analytic formulas for both the energy-density fraction spectrum and the angular power spectrum. For the energy-density fraction spectrum, we analyze all the relevant Feynman-like diagrams, determining their contributions to the spectrum in an order-by-order fashion. As for the angular power spectrum, our focus lies on the initial inhomogeneities, giving rise to anisotropies in SIGWs, that arise from the coupling between short- and long-wavelength modes due to primordial non-Gaussianity. Our analysis reveals that this spectrum exhibits a typical multipole dependence, characterized by $\tilde{C}_{\ell}\propto[\ell(\ell+1)]^{-1}$, which plays a crucial role in distinguishing between different sources of gravitational waves. Depending on model parameters, significant anisotropies can be achieved. We also show that the degeneracies in model parameters can be broken. The findings of our study underscore the angular power spectrum as a robust probe for investigating primordial non-Gaussianity and the physics of the early Universe. Moreover, our theoretical predictions can be tested using space-borne gravitational-wave detectors and pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Revisiting primordial black holes formation from preheating instabilities: the case of Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) in the early universe inflationary cosmology has garnered significant attention. One plausible scenario for primordial black hole (PBH) formation arises during the preheating stage following inflation. Notably, this scenario does not necessitate any ad-hoc fine-tuning of the scalar field potential. This paper focuses on the growth of primordial density perturbation and the consequent possibility of PBH formation in the preheating stage of the Starobinsky model for inflation. The typical mechanism for PBH formation during preheating is based on the collapse of primordial fluctuations that become super-horizon during inflation (type I) and re-enter the particle horizon in the different phases of cosmic expansion. In this work, we show that there exists a certain range of modes that remain in the sub-horizon (not exited) during inflation (type II modes) but evolve identically to type I modes if they fall into the instability band, leading to large density perturbation above the threshold and can potentially also contribute to the PBH formation. We detail the conditions determining the possible collapse of type I and/or type II modes whose wavelengths are larger than the Jeans length we derive from the effective sound speed of scalar field fluctuations. Since the preheating stage is an 'inflaton' (approximately) matter-dominated phase, we follow the framework of the critical collapse of fluctuations and compute the mass fraction using the well-known Press-Schechter and the Khlopov-Polnarev formalisms, and compare the two. Finally, we comment on the implications of our study for the investigations concerned with primordial accretion and consequent PBH contribution to the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the BAO Measurements of the CSST galaxy and AGN Spectroscopic Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectroscopic survey of China's Space Survey Telescope (CSST) is expected to obtain a huge number of slitless spectra, including more than one hundred million galaxy spectra and millions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectra. By making use of these spectra, we can measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals over large redshift ranges with excellent precisions. In this work, we predict the CSST measurements of the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectra at $0&lt;z&lt;1.2$ and pre-reconstruction AGN power spectra at $0&lt;z&lt;4$, and derive the BAO signals at different redshift bins by constraining the BAO scaling parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Our result shows that the CSST spectroscopic survey can provide accurate BAO measurements with precisions higher than 1\% and 3\% for the galaxy and AGN surveys, respectively. By comparing with current measurements in the same range at low redshifts, this can improve the precisions by a factor of $2\sim3$, and similar precisions can be obtained in the pessimistic case. We also investigate the constraints on the cosmological parameters using the measured BAO data by the CSST, and obtain stringent constraint results for the energy density of dark matter, Hubble constant, and equation of state of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Varying primordial state fractions in exo- and endothermic SIDM simulations of Milky Way-mass haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is increasingly studied as a potential solution to small-scale discrepancies between simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) and observations. We examine a physically motivated two-state SIDM model with both elastic and inelastic scatterings. In particular, endothermic, exothermic, and elastic scattering occur with equal probability at high relative velocities ($v_{\rm rel}\gtrsim400~{\rm km/s})$. In a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulation of Milky Way-size haloes, we vary the primordial state fractions to understand the impact of inelastic dark matter self-interactions on halo structure and evolution. In particular, we test how the initial conditions impact the present-day properties of dark matter haloes. Depending on the primordial state fraction, scattering reactions will be dominated by either exothermic or endothermic effects for high and low initial excited state fractions respectively. We find that increasing the initial excited fraction reduces the mass of the main halo, as well as the number of subhaloes on all mass scales. The main haloes are cored, with lower inner densities and higher outer densities compared with CDM. Additionally, we find that the shape of the main halo becomes more spherical the higher the initial excited state fraction is. Finally, we show that the number of satellites steadily decreases with initial excited state fraction across all satellite masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new picture of the early universe in finite nonlocal quantum gravity, which is conformally invariant at the classical and quantum levels. The high-energy regime of the theory consists of two phases, a conformally invariant trans-Planckian phase and a post-Planckian or Higgs phase described by an action quadratic in the Ricci tensor and where the cosmos evolves according to the standard radiation-dominated model. In the first phase, all the issues of the hot big bang such as the singularity, flatness, and horizon problems find a universal and simple non-inflationary solution by means of Weyl (or scale, or conformal) invariance, regardless of the microscopic details of the theory. In the second phase, once conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, primordial perturbations are generated around a background that asymptotically evolves as a radiation-dominated flat Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker universe.</description>

      <title>Negative Lags on the Viscous Timescale in Quasar Photometry and Prospects for Detecting More with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variability of quasar light curves can be used to study the structure of quasar accretion disks. For example, continuum reverberation mapping uses delays between variability in short and long wavelength bands ("short" lags) to measure the radial extent and temperature profile of the disk. Recently, a potential reverse lag, where variations in shorter wavelength bands lag the longer wavelength bands at the much longer viscous timescale, was detected for Fairall 9. Inspired by this detection, we derive a timescale for these "long" negative lags from fluctuation propagation models and recent simulations. We use this timescale to forecast our ability to detect long lags using the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). After exploring several methods, including the interpolated cross-correlation function, a Von-Neumann estimator, javelin, and a maximum-likelihood Fourier method, we find that our two main methods, javelin and the maximum-likelihood method, can together detect long lags of up to several hundred days in mock LSST light curves. Our methods work best on proposed LSST cadences with long season lengths, but can also work for the current baseline LSST cadence, especially if we add observations from other optical telescopes during seasonal gaps. We find that LSST has the potential to detect dozens to hundreds of additional long lags. Detecting these long lags can teach us about the vertical structure of quasar disks and how it scales with different quasar properties.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference methodology to characterize the dust emissivity at far-infrared and submillimeter frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian inference method to characterise the dust emission properties using the well-known dust-HI correlation in the diffuse interstellar medium at Planck frequencies $\nu \ge 217$ GHz. We use the Galactic HI map from the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) as a template to trace the Galactic dust emission. We jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity and the zero level present in the Planck intensity maps. We use the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique to sample the high dimensional parameter space ($D \sim 10^3$). We demonstrate that the methodology leads to unbiased recovery of dust emissivity per pixel and the zero level when applied to realistic Planck sky simulations over a 6300 deg$^2$ area around the Southern Galactic pole. As an application on data, we analyse the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz to jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity at Nside=32 resolution (1.8\deg\ pixel size) and the global offset. We find that the spatially varying dust emissivity has a mean of 0.031 $MJysr (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$ and $1\sigma$ standard deviation of 0.007 $MJysr (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$. The mean dust emissivity increases monotonically with increasing mean HI column density. We find that the inferred global offset is consistent with the expected level of Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) monopole added to the Planck data at 353 GHz. This method is useful in studying the line-of-sight variations of dust spectral energy distribution in the multi-phase interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis through Asymmetric Reheating in the Mirror Twin Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the $\nu\phi$MTH, a Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH) model realizing asymmetric reheating, baryogenesis and twin-baryogenesis through the out-of-equilibrium decay of a right-handed neutrino without any hard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking. The MTH is the simplest Neutral Naturalness solution to the little hierarchy problem and predicts the existence of a twin dark sector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is only softly broken by a higher twin Higgs vacuum expectation value. The asymmetric reheating cools the twin sector compared to the visible one, thus evading cosmological bounds on $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The addition of (twin-)colored scalars allows for the generation of the visible baryon asymmetry and, by the virtue of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, also results in the generation of a twin baryon asymmetry. We identify a unique scenario with top-philic couplings for the new scalars that can satisfy all cosmological, proton decay and LHC constraints; yield the observed SM baryon asymmetry; and generate a wide range of possible twin baryon DM fractions, from negligible to unity. The viable regime of the theory contains several hints as to the possible structure of the Twin Higgs UV completion. Our results motivate the search for the rich cosmological and astrophysical signatures of twin baryons, and atomic dark matter more generally, at cosmological, galactic and stellar scales.</description>

      <title>Earliest Galaxies in the JADES Origins Field: Luminosity Function and Cosmic Star-Formation Rate Density 300 Myr after the Big Bang</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the earliest galaxy population in the JADES Origins Field (JOF), the deepest imaging field observed with JWST. We make use of the ancillary Hubble optical images (5 filters spanning $0.4-0.9\mu\mathrm{m}$) and novel JWST images with 14 filters spanning $0.8-5\mu\mathrm{m}$, including 7 medium-band filters, and reaching total exposure times of up to 46 hours per filter. We combine all our data at $&gt;2.3\mu\mathrm{m}$ to construct an ultradeep image, reaching as deep as $\approx31.4$ AB mag in the stack and 30.3-31.0 AB mag ($5\sigma$, $r=0.1"$ circular aperture) in individual filters. We measure photometric redshifts and use robust selection criteria to identify a sample of eight galaxy candidates at redshifts $z=11.5-15$. These objects show compact half-light radii of $R_{1/2}\sim50-200$pc, stellar masses of $M_{\star}\sim10^7-10^8 M_{\odot}$, and star-formation rates of $\mathrm{SFR}\sim0.1-1\,M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Our search finds no candidates at $15&lt;z&lt;20$, placing upper limits at these redshifts. We develop a forward modeling approach to infer the properties of the evolving luminosity function without binning in redshift or luminosity that marginalizes over the photometric redshift uncertainty of our candidate galaxies and incorporates the impact of non-detections. We find a $z=12$ luminosity function in good agreement with prior results, and that the luminosity function normalization and UV luminosity density decline by a factor of $\sim2.5$ from $z=12$ to $z=14$. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of theoretical models for evolution of the dark matter halo mass function.</description>

      <title>New dark matter analysis of Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies with MADHATv2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain bounds on dark matter annihilation using 14 years of publicly available Fermi-LAT data from a set of 54 dwarf spheroidal galaxies, using spectral information from 16 energy bins. We perform this analysis using our updated and publicly available code MADHATv2, which can be used to test a variety of models for dark matter particle physics and astrophysics in an accessible manner. In particular, we note that including Carina III in the analysis strengthens constraints on $s$-wave annihilation into two-body Standard Model final states by a factor of $\sim 3$ but broadens the error on the constraint due to the large uncertainty of its $J$-factor. Our findings illustrate the importance of verifying if Carina III is in fact a dwarf spheroidal galaxy and measuring more precisely its $J$-factor. More generally, they highlight the significance of forthcoming discoveries of nearby ultra-faint dwarfs for dark matter indirect detection.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic platform for studying the first-order phase transitions in superfluid helium-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetry-breaking first-order phase transition between superfluid phases $^3$He-A and $^3$He-B can be triggered extrinsically by ionising radiation or heterogeneous nucleation arising from the details of the sample cell construction. However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase transitions between the two. The objective is to study the nucleation as a function of temperature and pressure over the full phase diagram, to both better test the proposed extrinsic mechanisms and seek potential parallel intrinsic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A path towards constraining the evolution of the interstellar medium and outflows in the Milky Way using APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the study of the Milky Way has significantly advanced due to extensive spectroscopic surveys of its stars, complemented by astroseismic and astrometric data. However, it remains disjoint from recent advancements in understanding the physics of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). This paper introduces a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way that can be constrained on stellar data, because it combines a state-of-the-art ISM model with a Milky Way stellar disc model. Utilizing a dataset of red clump stars from APOGEE, known for their precise ages and metallicities, we concentrate on the last 6 billion years -- a period marked by Milky Way's secular evolution. We examine the oxygen abundance in the low-$\alpha$ disc stars relative to their ages and birth radii, validating or constraining critical ISM parameters that remain largely unexplored in extragalactic observations. The models that successfully reproduce the radius -- metallicity distribution and the age -- metallicity distribution of stars without violating existing ISM observations indicate a need for modest differential oxygen enrichment in Galactic outflows, meaning that the oxygen abundance of outflows is higher than the local ISM abundance, irrespective of outflow mass loading. The models also suggest somewhat elevated ISM gas velocity dispersion levels over the past 6 billion years compared to galaxies of similar mass. The extra turbulence necessary could result from energy from gas accretion onto the Galaxy, supernovae clustering in the ISM, or increased star formation efficiency per freefall time. This work provides a novel approach to constraining the Galactic ISM and outflows, leveraging the detailed insights available from contemporary Milky Way surveys.</description>
