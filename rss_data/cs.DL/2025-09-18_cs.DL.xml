      <title>Keywords are not always the key: A metadata field analysis for natural language search on open data portals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open data portals are essential for providing public access to open datasets. However, their search interfaces typically rely on keyword-based mechanisms and a narrow set of metadata fields. This design makes it difficult for users to find datasets using natural language queries. The problem is worsened by metadata that is often incomplete or inconsistent, especially when users lack familiarity with domain-specific terminology. In this paper, we examine how individual metadata fields affect the success of conversational dataset retrieval and whether LLMs can help bridge the gap between natural queries and structured metadata. We conduct a controlled ablation study using simulated natural language queries over real-world datasets to evaluate retrieval performance under various metadata configurations. We also compare existing content of the metadata field 'description' with LLM-generated content, exploring how different prompting strategies influence quality and impact on search outcomes. Our findings suggest that dataset descriptions play a central role in aligning with user intent, and that LLM-generated descriptions can support effective retrieval. These results highlight both the limitations of current metadata practices and the potential of generative models to improve dataset discoverability in open data portals.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Public Chest Radiography Datasets for Artificial Intelligence: Label Quality, Domain Shift, Bias and Evaluation Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown significant promise in chest radiography, where deep learning models can approach radiologist-level diagnostic performance. Progress has been accelerated by large public datasets such as MIMIC-CXR, ChestX-ray14, PadChest, and CheXpert, which provide hundreds of thousands of labelled images with pathology annotations. However, these datasets also present important limitations. Automated label extraction from radiology reports introduces errors, particularly in handling uncertainty and negation, and radiologist review frequently disagrees with assigned labels. In addition, domain shift and population bias restrict model generalisability, while evaluation practices often overlook clinically meaningful measures. We conduct a systematic analysis of these challenges, focusing on label quality, dataset bias, and domain shift. Our cross-dataset domain shift evaluation across multiple model architectures revealed substantial external performance degradation, with pronounced reductions in AUPRC and F1 scores relative to internal testing. To assess dataset bias, we trained a source-classification model that distinguished datasets with near-perfect accuracy, and performed subgroup analyses showing reduced performance for minority age and sex groups. Finally, expert review by two board-certified radiologists identified significant disagreement with public dataset labels. Our findings highlight important clinical weaknesses of current benchmarks and emphasise the need for clinician-validated datasets and fairer evaluation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Streamlining and standardizing software citations with The Software Citation Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software is crucial for the advancement of astronomy especially in the context of rapidly growing datasets that increasingly require algorithm and pipeline development to process the data and produce results. However, software has not always been consistently cited, despite its importance to strengthen support for software development. To encourage, streamline, and standardize the process of citing software in academic work such as publications we introduce 'The Software Citation Station': a publicly available website and tool to quickly find or add software citations</description>
