      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in the helical state of a superconductor/ferromagnet bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the microscopic mechanism of nucleation of the helical superconducting state maintained by a spin-splitting field and weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a 2D superconductor/ferromagnet system and present an exact solution for the Gor'kov equations, which provides a full description of the thermodynamic properties of the system under consideration. This permits us to obtain the Ginzburg-Landau expansion and use it to analyze the possibility of controlling magnetization using the transport supercurrent in both dc and quasistatic ac regimes. We show that these properties are related to the manifestation of the diode effect in superconducting systems with spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Landau-Level Quantization and Band Splitting of FeSe Monolayers Revealed by Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors that reside on substrates must be influenced by Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The intriguing effect of Rashba-type SOCs on iron-based superconductors (IBSs) has remained largely a mystery. In this work, we unveil modified Landau-level spectroscopy and the intricate band splitting of FeSe monolayers through the precision of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, which unequivocally demonstrates the presence of Rashba SOC. The discovery sheds light on a nonparabolic electron band at the X/Y point, displaying a distinctive Landau quantization behavior characterized by $E_n\propto(nB)^{4/3}$. The theoretical model aligns with our experimental insights, positing that the k$^4$-term of the electron band becomes predominant and profoundly reshapes the band structure. Our research underscores the pivotal role of the Rashba SOC effect on 2D superconductors and sets the stage to probe new quantum states in systems with remarkably low carrier concentrations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Quantum Criticality Class Crossover at the LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (111) Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) limit, the quantum fluctuation is significantly enhanced which could induce a quantum phase transition. Investigating the quantum criticality is an effective approach to elucidate the underlying physics of 2D superconductivity. Here we report the observation of different universality classes of quantum criticality at the superconducting LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (111) interface, i.e. the normal quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) and the anomalous QGS. The switch of the quantum criticality class is observed from the normal QGS in a low $T_c$ sample with weaker spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to the anomalous QGS in a high $T_c$ sample with stronger SOC. Moreover, owing to the remarkable SOC strength, the high $T_c$ sample exhibits an unprecedentedly enhanced quantum fluctuation at an unusually elevated temperature approaching the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature $T_{BKT}$. This work provides comprehensive recognition of the different quantum criticality classes in the same superconducting LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (111) system, which deepens the understanding of the superconducting mechanism of interfacial superconductors.</description>

      <title>Fermion Casimir effect and magnetic Larkin-Ovchinnikov phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how magnetic fields affect the Casimir effect within the context of a simple quasi-1D interacting fermionic system. A novel phenomenon emerges, resulting from the interaction between external magnetic fields and boundary conditions, which alters the ground state in complex ways and leads to first-order phase transitions among various ground states, specifically inhomogeneous solutions with differing node counts. We calculate the Casimir force, which exhibits discontinuities (jumps) at the transition points between the different ground states.</description>

      <title>Hot (non-equilibrium) electron relaxation: A review of the ultra-fast phenomena in metals and superconductors (PART I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous Two-Temperature Model (TTM) used extensively in the investigations of energy relaxation in photo-excited systems originated in the seminal work of M. I. Kaganov, I. M. Lifshitz, and L. V. Tanatarov (KLT) in 1957. The idea that with an ultra short laser pulse a temporal (transient) state of electrons in a metal can be created in which electrons after absorbing energy from the laser pulse heat up and their temperature becomes substantially greater than that of lattice was originated in the work of S. I. Anisimov, B. L. Kapeliovich, and T. L. Perel'man in 1974. The heated electron sub-system ("hot" electrons) loses its energy to phonon sub-system via electron-phonon scattering (relaxation) and thermodynamic equilibrium re-establishes over a time scale of a few pico-seconds (psecs) in metals. This field saw great developments in the 1980s and 1990s with the advent of femto-second (fsec) pump-probe spectroscopy. And from 2000 onwards focus shifted from non-equilibrium phenomena in simple metals to that in more complex systems including strongly correlated systems such as high Tc cuprate superconductors. In 1987, P. B. Allen re-visits the calculations of KLT and re-writes the electron-phonon heat transfer coefficient $\alpha$ in terms of a very important parameter in the theory of superconductivity. Year 2000 onwards, field saw the development of models that go beyond the original TTM. Very recently, field enters into atto-second domain. In this article, author attempts a rigorous and concise account of the entire development of this very fascinating area of research including a summary of the current research in this field.</description>

      <title>Theory of symmetry-resolved quench-drive spectroscopy: Nonlinear response of phase-fluctuating superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on cuprates have shown the possibility of opening a gap above the superconducting critical temperature, in the so-called phase-fluctuating state, by enhancing the phase coherence of preformed Cooper pairs. Quench-drive spectroscopy, an implementation of 2D coherent spectroscopy, has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating out-of-equilibrium superconductors and their collective modes. In this work, we enrich the quench-drive scheme by developing a systematic generalization to study the nonlinear response of $d$-wave incoherent Cooper pairs in a symmetry resolved manner. In particular, we do not only show that it is possible to obtain a third harmonic signal from fully incoherent pairs with an equilibrium vanishing order parameter, but we also characterize the full flourishing 2D spectrum of the generated nonlinear response. The results provide a deeper theoretical insight on recent experimental results, opening the door to a new symmetry-driven design of future experiments on unconventional and enhanced superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital Edelstein effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductors without inversion symmetry can exhibit a non-zero magnetization when a supercurrent is present, leading to non-dissipative magnetoelectric effects. Here, we focus on understanding the relation between the spin and orbital properties of these effects in conventional spin-singlet noncentrosymmetric superconductors with orbital Rashba coupling, particularly for multiorbital electronic systems with coupled spin and orbital moments. We investigate how atomic spin-orbit coupling influences the magnitude and direction of the spin and orbital Edelstein effect. Our findings indicate that the correlation between spin and orbital moments induced by supercurrents is generally not determined by the sign of atomic spin-orbit coupling, but rather by the number of bands at the Fermi level and the orbital characteristics of those bands with respect to the mirror parity. We investigate the character of the spin and orbital Edelstein effect by examining its dependence in momentum space and the role of avoiding crossings in determining the induced magnetization. The outcomes demonstrate that the sign change of the orbital Edelstein effect near avoiding crossing bands remains robust despite modifications to the atomic spin-orbit amplitude. Furthermore, we observe that the spin Edelstein effect is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital Edelstein effect, but can be significantly enhanced in certain scenarios with increased atomic spin-orbit coupling. These results indicate that by manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in noncentrosymmetric materials, the relationship between the spin and orbital Edelstein moments can be effectively controlled.</description>

      <title>Vortex structure in a $d$-wave superconductor obtained by a confinement transition from the pseudogap metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the structure of flux $h/(2e)$ vortices in a $d$-wave superconductor using a continuum SU(2) gauge theory of 2 flavors of charge $e$, SU(2)-fundamental Higgs bosons. Period-2 charge order is present near the vortex center. Upon coupling the electrons to the superconducting and charge order parameters, we find that the electronic local density of states does not have a zero-bias peak, in contrast to BCS theory. But there are sub-gap peaks at positive and negative bias, and these exhibit anti-phase periodic spatial modulations, as observed in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments in the underdoped cuprates (K. Matsuba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 063704 (2007)).</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization Model for Composite Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) model to describe the magnetization and instantaneous power loss of composite superconductors subject to time-varying magnetic fields. Once the parameters of the ROHM model are fixed based on reference simulations, it allows to directly compute the macroscopic response of composite superconductors without the need to solve the detailed current density distribution. It can then be used as part of a homogenization method in large-scale superconducting models to significantly reduce the computational effort compared to detailed simulations. In this contribution, we focus on the case of a strand with twisted superconducting filaments subject to a time-varying transverse magnetic field. We propose two levels of ROHM models: (i) a rate-independent model that reproduces hysteresis in the filaments, and (ii) a rate-dependent model that generalizes the first level by also reproducing dynamic effects due to coupling and eddy currents. We describe the implementation and inclusion of these models in a finite element framework, discuss how to deduce the model parameters, and finally demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of excitation frequencies and amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Metastability in individual magnetic vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles play a crucial role in different fields such as biomedicine or information and quantum technologies. These applications require nanoparticles with a single, well-defined energy minimum, free of metastable states, and characterized by narrow switching field distributions. Here, we demonstrate that high-transition-temperature nanoSQUIDs can be successfully applied to the characterization of individual nanodiscs hosting magnetic vortices. We present measurements performed under varying temperature and external magnetic field, revealing signatures of ubiquitous, multiple metastable configurations. We also demonstrate that metastability can be reduced by introducing an intended asymmetry. NanoSQUID measurements can be applied to optimize the fabrication of on-demand spin-texture states, such as degenerated vortices or particles with fixed circulation and deterministic and narrow switching probabilities.</description>
