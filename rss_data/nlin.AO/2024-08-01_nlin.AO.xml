      <title>The impact of quantum noise on limit cycles and entrainment in an atom-cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise is inherent in any open quantum system as it affects not only the statistical properties of the initial state but also the time evolution of the system. A transversely pumped atom-cavity setup is a prototypical example of such an open system, wherein limit cycles (LCs) have been observed and identified as continuous time crystals (CTCs). Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system to exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical value predicted by mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced enhancement of temporal ordering. By comparing the oscillation frequencies of the LCs for the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) regimes, we find that the LC frequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D than in 2D. We demonstrate that this has an important consequence in the effectiveness of entrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Physics-Informed Bio-Silicon Intelligence System: Integrating Hybrid Systems, Biocomputing, Neural Networks, and Machine Learning, for Advanced Neurotechnology</title>

Abstract: We present the Bio-Silicon Intelligence System (BSIS), an innovative hybrid platform that integrates biological neural networks with silicon-based computing. The BSIS, a Physics-Informed Hybrid Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning State Machine, employs carbon nanotube-coated electrodes to interface rat brains with computational systems, enabling high-fidelity neural interfacing and bidirectional communication through self-organizing systems in both biological and silicon forms. Our system leverages both analogue and digital AI theory, incorporating concepts from computational theory, chaos theory, dynamical systems theory, physics, and quantum mechanics. Additionally, the BSIS replicates the neuronal dynamics typical of intelligent brain tissue, employing nonlinear operations underlying learning and information storage. Neural signals are read through the FreeEEG32 board and BrainFlow software, then features are extracted and mapped to game actions by tracking feature changes in continuous data. Metadata is encoded into both analogue and digital brain stimulation signals at the microvolt level using our proprietary software and hardware. The system employs a dual signaling approach for training the rat brain, incorporating a reward solution and sound as well as human-inaudible distress sounds. This paper details the design, theory, functionality, and technical specifications of the BSIS, highlighting its interdisciplinary approach and advanced technological integration.</description>
