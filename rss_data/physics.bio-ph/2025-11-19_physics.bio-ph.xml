      <title>Study of Quantum Confinement inside a Viral Capsid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical computational methods, such as molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, have long been the standard for modeling viral structure and function. However, these approaches may overlook crucial quantum phenomena that operate at the nanoscale, particularly within the highly-compacted genetic material of the viral capsid. The confined, high-density environment of genetic material within the capsid strongly suggests that quantum confinement effects play a significant, yet unexplored, role in viral processes. This study introduces a novel quantum approach using Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SQM) to investigate the quantum confinement effects on viruses. In this paper, the viral capsid environment is modeled using the Pariacoto virus, a model system well-suited for this analysis due to its specific structural properties. The findings reveal that quantum effects are not merely marginal but essential for understanding key processes inside the capsid, providing new insights beyond the scope of classical physics.</description>

      <title>Rapid Design and Fabrication of Body Conformable Surfaces with Kirigami Cutting and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By integrating the principles of kirigami cutting and data-driven modeling, this study aims to develop a personalized, rapid, and low-cost design and fabrication pipeline for creating body-conformable surfaces around the knee joint. The process begins with 3D scanning of the anterior knee surface of human subjects, followed by extracting the corresponding skin deformation between two joint angles in terms of longitudinal strain and Poisson's ratio. In parallel, a machine learning model is constructed using extensive simulation data from experimentally calibrated finite element analysis. This model employs Gaussian Process (GP) regression to relate kirigami cut lengths to the resulting longitudinal strain and Poisson's ratio. With an R2 score of 0.996, GP regression outperforms other models in predicting kirigami's large deformations. Finally, an inverse design approach based on the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is used to generate kirigami patch designs that replicate the in-plane skin deformation observed from the knee scans. This pipeline was applied to three human subjects, and the resulting kirigami knee patches were fabricated using rapid laser cutting, requiring only a business day from knee scanning to kirigami patch delivery. The low-cost, personalized kirigami patches successfully conformed to over 75 percent of the skin area across all subjects, establishing a foundation for a wide range of wearable devices. The study demonstrates this potential through an impact-resistant kirigami foam patch, which not only conforms to dynamic knee motion but also provides joint protection against impact. Finally, the proposed design and fabrication framework is generalizable and can be extended to other deforming body surfaces, enabling the creation of personalized wearables such as protective gear, breathable adhesives, and body-conformable electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Biology, Quantum Simulation and Quantum Coherent Devices</title>

Abstract: Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.</description>

      <title>Integral Bayesian symbolic regression for optimal discovery of governing equations from scarce and noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how systems evolve over time often requires discovering the differential equations that govern their behavior. Automatically learning these equations from experimental data is challenging when the data are noisy or limited, and existing approaches struggle, in particular, with the estimation of unobserved derivatives. Here, we introduce an integral Bayesian symbolic regression method that learns governing equations directly from raw time-series data, without requiring manual assumptions or error-prone derivative estimation. By sampling the space of symbolic differential equations and evaluating them via numerical integration, our method robustly identifies governing equations even from noisy or scarce data. We show that this approach accurately recovers ground-truth models in synthetic benchmarks, and that it makes quasi-optimal predictions of system dynamics for all noise regimes. Applying this method to bacterial growth experiments across multiple species and substrates, we discover novel growth equations that outperform classical models in accurately capturing all phases of microbial proliferation, including lag, exponential, and saturation. Unlike standard approaches, our method reveals subtle shifts in growth dynamics, such as double ramp-ups or non-canonical transitions, offering a deeper, data-driven understanding of microbial physiology.</description>

      <title>Inertial active particles in a Poiseuille flow: negative mobility and particle separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusive behavior of small entities is strongly influenced by the flow of the surrounding medium, which is ubiquitous in natural and artificial environments. In this study, we investigate the transport characteristics of the inertial active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a microfluidic channel under a Poiseuille flow. The interplay between the inertia of the particles and the imposed fluid flow leads to interesting diffusive behaviors. For instance, in the overdamped regime ($m \to 0$), particles exhibit a negative average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ due to upstream movement. As $m$ increases, particles tend to move along the flow direction with an increase in $\langle v \rangle$ in the positive direction, exhibiting a maximum at optimal $m$, and diminish for higher $m$ values. The effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff}$ also shows a peak at this optimal $m$. Interestingly, at higher $m$ values, $D_{eff}$ decreases with increasing the noise strength. The self-propelled velocity of the particles further enhances the upstream movement. Further, the rotation rate of the particles also contributes positively to the upstream motion, and enhances the diffusion of the particles by many orders in the limit of higher $m$. This study reveals that inertia not only modifies swimmer flow interactions but also enables new dynamical regimes, where mass-dependent trajectories can be harnessed for selective control. Such control holds promise for mass based particle separation in precisely engineered environments and lab on a chip devices for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Spatially Correlated Noise Induces Transitions from the Diffusive to Ballistic Regime in Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated thermal noise characterized by a single length scale. This formulation is constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the fluctuation--dissipation relation (FDR), which enforces the same spatial correlation in the viscous diffusion term and therefore gives rise to nonlocal momentum transport. Numerical simulations of tracer diffusion in fluids governed by this formulation reveal that the mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length $\ell$ and the correlation strength $\beta$. Intuitively, increasing $\ell$ enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, as a larger correlation length slows momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing $\beta$ also increases the MSD, since a weaker correlation strength also retards momentum diffusion, whereas smaller $\ell$ or larger $\beta$ suppresses the ballistic regime and leads to a diffusive behavior. The emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from how spatial correlations, incorporated through the FDR to maintain equilibrium, alter the effective momentum transport across scales. Interestingly, we further show that the resulting nonlocal diffusion is reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Murray's Law as an Entropy-per-Information-Cost Extremum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport networks must balance viscous pumping losses with the energetic cost of maintaining an operative architecture. This paper formulates that trade-off as an entropy-per-information-cost (EPIC) extremum that prices structural upkeep in calibrated units (joules per bit). An upkeep law r^m distinguishes volume-priced (m = 2) from surface-priced (m = 1) maintenance. In laminar Poiseuille flow, stationarity yields (i) a generalized Murray scaling Q proportional to r^alpha with alpha = (m + 4)/2; (ii) a tariff-weighted vector balance that fixes bifurcation geometry and predicts near-symmetric daughter openings of about 75 degrees for m = 2 and about 97 degrees for m = 1; and (iii) a universal partition of power between pumping and upkeep. Eliminating radii gives a strictly concave flux cost proportional to Q^gamma with gamma = 2m/(m + 4), favoring mergers and deep tree hierarchies, and defines a routing index that induces Snell-like refraction of optimal paths across spatial tariff contrasts. A preregistered, held-out test on retinal bifurcations from the High-Resolution Fundus dataset (N = 19,126) shows sharp vector closure: the median residual is R = 0.232 with a nonparametric 95 percent bootstrap interval [0.229, 0.236], 91 percent of junctions fall under the pre-specified strict threshold, and structure-preserving nulls shift decisively to larger residuals. These results render classical branching relations explicitly unit-bearing (J/bit) and provide falsifiable geometric targets and quantitative design rules for transport networks.</description>
