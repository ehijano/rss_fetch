      <title>Building Browser Agents: Architecture, Security, and Practical Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Browser agents enable autonomous web interaction but face critical reliability and security challenges in production. This paper presents findings from building and operating a production browser agent. The analysis examines where current approaches fail and what prevents safe autonomous operation. The fundamental insight: model capability does not limit agent performance; architectural decisions determine success or failure. Security analysis of real-world incidents reveals prompt injection attacks make general-purpose autonomous operation fundamentally unsafe. The paper argues against developing general browsing intelligence in favor of specialized tools with programmatic constraints, where safety boundaries are enforced through code instead of large language model (LLM) reasoning. Through hybrid context management combining accessibility tree snapshots with selective vision, comprehensive browser tooling matching human interaction capabilities, and intelligent prompt engineering, the agent achieved approximately 85% success rate on the WebGames benchmark across 53 diverse challenges (compared to approximately 50% reported for prior browser agents and 95.7% human baseline).</description>

      <title>Z-Space: A Multi-Agent Tool Orchestration Framework for Enterprise-Grade LLM Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models can break through knowledge and timeliness limitations by invoking external tools within the Model Context Protocol framework to achieve automated execution of complex tasks. However, with the rapid growth of enterprise-scale MCP services, efficiently and accurately matching target functionalities among thousands of heterogeneous tools has become a core challenge restricting system practicality. Existing approaches generally rely on full-prompt injection or static semantic retrieval, facing issues including semantic disconnection between user queries and tool descriptions, context inflation in LLM input, and high inference latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Z-Space, a data-generation-oriented multi-agent collaborative tool invocation framework Z-Space. The Z-Space framework establishes a multi-agent collaborative architecture and tool filtering algorithm: (1) A structured semantic understanding of user queries is achieved through an intent parsing model; (2) A tool filtering module (FSWW) based on fused subspace weighted algorithm realizes fine-grained semantic alignment between intents and tools without parameter tuning; (3) An inference execution agent is constructed to support dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution for multi-step tasks. This framework has been deployed in the Eleme platform's technical division, serving large-scale test data generation scenarios across multiple business units including Taotian, Gaode, and Hema. Production data demonstrates that the system reduces average token consumption in tool inference by 96.26\% while achieving a 92\% tool invocation accuracy rate, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of intelligent test data generation systems.</description>

      <title>stable-pretraining-v1: Foundation Model Research Made Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models and self-supervised learning (SSL) have become central to modern AI, yet research in this area remains hindered by complex codebases, redundant re-implementations, and the heavy engineering burden of scaling experiments. We present stable-pretraining, a modular, extensible, and performance-optimized library built on top of PyTorch, Lightning, Hugging Face, and TorchMetrics. Unlike prior toolkits focused narrowly on reproducing state-of-the-art results, stable-pretraining is designed for flexibility and iteration speed: it unifies essential SSL utilities--including probes, collapse detection metrics, augmentation pipelines, and extensible evaluation routines--within a coherent and reliable framework. A central design principle is logging everything, enabling fine-grained visibility into training dynamics that makes debugging, monitoring, and reproducibility seamless. We validate the library by demonstrating its ability to generate new research insights with minimal overhead, including depthwise representation probing and the analysis of CLIP degradation under synthetic data finetuning. By lowering barriers to entry while remaining scalable to large experiments, stable-pretraining aims to accelerate discovery and expand the possibilities of foundation model research.</description>

      <title>Evolution without an Oracle: Driving Effective Evolution with LLM Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Computation (EC) has unlocked new frontiers in scientific discovery but remains shackled by a fundamental constraint: the reliance on an Oracle--an objective, machine-computable fitness function. This paper breaks this barrier by asking: Can evolution thrive in a purely subjective landscape governed solely by LLM judges? We introduce MADE (Multi-Agent Decomposed Evolution), a framework that tames the inherent noise of subjective evaluation through "Problem Specification." By decomposing vague instructions into specific, verifiable sub-requirements, MADE transforms high-variance LLM feedback into stable, precise selection pressure. The results are transformative: across complex benchmarks like DevAI and InfoBench, MADE outperforms strong baselines by over 50% in software requirement satisfaction (39.9% to 61.9%) and achieves a 95% perfect pass rate on complex instruction following. This work validates a fundamental paradigm shift: moving from optimizing "computable metrics" to "describable qualities," thereby unlocking evolutionary optimization for the vast open-ended domains where no ground truth exists.</description>

      <title>CodeR3: A GenAI-Powered Workflow Repair and Revival Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific workflows encode valuable domain expertise and computational methodologies. Yet studies consistently show that a significant proportion of published workflows suffer from decay over time. This problem is particularly acute for legacy workflow systems like Taverna, where discontinued services, obsolete dependencies, and system retirement render previously functional workflows unusable. We present a novel legacy workflow migration system, called CodeR$^3$ (stands for Code Repair, Revival and Reuse), that leverages generative AI to analyze the characteristics of decayed workflows, reproduce them into modern workflow technologies like Snakemake and VisFlow. Our system additionally integrates stepwise workflow analysis visualization, automated service substitution, and human-in-the-loop validation. Through several case studies of Taverna workflow revival, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach while identifying key challenges that require human oversight. Our findings reveal that automation significantly reduces manual effort in workflow parsing and service identification. However, critical tasks such as service substitution and data validation still require domain expertise. Our result will be a crowdsourcing platform that enables the community to collaboratively revive decayed workflows and validate the functionality and correctness of revived workflows. This work contributes a framework for workflow revival that balances automation efficiency with necessary human judgment.</description>

      <title>Agint: Agentic Graph Compilation for Software Engineering Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are increasingly common but still face challenges in context management, latency, reliability, reproducibility, and scalability. We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.</description>

      <title>CodeFuse-CommitEval: Towards Benchmarking LLM's Power on Commit Message and Code Change Inconsistency Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Version control relies on commit messages to convey the rationale for code changes, but these messages are often low quality and, more critically, inconsistent with their diffs-known as message-code inconsistency (MCI). MCIs mislead reviewers, hinder maintenance, contaminate research datasets, and may obscure security patches. Yet, no dedicated benchmark exists to evaluate models for MCI detection. We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level "purpose" inconsistencies. CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL provides a rigorous foundation for measuring, comparing, and advancing MCI detection, highlighting the need for richer context and balanced data to capture high-level semantic gaps.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Automated Unit Test Generation and Assessment in Java: The AgoneTest Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20403v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit testing is an essential but resource-intensive step in software development, ensuring individual code units function correctly. This paper introduces AgoneTest, an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Model-generated (LLM) unit tests in Java. AgoneTest does not aim to propose a novel test generation algorithm; rather, it supports researchers and developers in comparing different LLMs and prompting strategies through a standardized end-to-end evaluation pipeline under realistic conditions. We introduce the Classes2Test dataset, which maps Java classes under test to their corresponding test classes, and a framework that integrates advanced evaluation metrics, such as mutation score and test smells, for a comprehensive assessment. Experimental results show that, for the subset of tests that compile, LLM-generated tests can match or exceed human-written tests in terms of coverage and defect detection. Our findings also demonstrate that enhanced prompting strategies contribute to test quality. AgoneTest clarifies the potential of LLMs in software testing and offers insights for future improvements in model design, prompt engineering, and testing practices.</description>

      <title>Translating Large-Scale C Repositories to Idiomatic Rust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing C to Rust translation techniques fail to balance quality and scalability: transpilation-based approaches scale to large projects but produce code with poor safety, idiomaticity, and readability. In contrast, LLM-based techniques are prohibitively expensive due to their reliance on frontier models (without which they cannot reliably generate compilable translations), thus limiting scalability. This paper proposes Rustine, a fully automated pipeline for effective and efficient repository-level C to idiomatic safe Rust translation. Evaluating on a diverse set of 23 C programs, ranging from 27 to 13,200 lines of code, Rustine can generate fully compilable Rust code for all and achieve 87% functional equivalence (passing 1,063,099 assertions out of 1,221,192 in test suites with average function and line coverage of 74.7% and 72.2%). Compared to six prior repository-level C to Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer Rust linter violations), and more readable. When the translations cannot pass all tests to fulfill functional equivalence, human developers were able to complete the task in 4.5 hours, on average, using Rustine as debugging support.</description>

      <title>Understanding Accelerator Compilers via Performance Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerator design languages (ADLs), high-level languages that compile to hardware units, help domain experts quickly design efficient application-specific hardware. ADL compilers optimize datapaths and convert software-like control flow constructs into control paths. Such compilers are necessarily complex and often unpredictable: they must bridge the wide semantic gap between high-level semantics and cycle-level schedules, and they typically rely on advanced heuristics to optimize circuits. The resulting performance can be difficult to control, requiring guesswork to find and resolve performance problems in the generated hardware. We conjecture that ADL compilers will never be perfect: some performance unpredictability is endemic to the problem they solve.
  In lieu of compiler perfection, we argue for compiler understanding tools that give ADL programmers insight into how the compiler's decisions affect performance. We introduce Petal, a cycle-level Petal for the Calyx intermediate language (IL). Petal instruments the Calyx code with probes and then analyzes the trace from a register-transfer-level simulation. It maps the events in the trace back to high-level control constructs in the Calyx code to track the clock cycles when each construct was active. Using case studies, we demonstrate that Petal's cycle-level profiles can identify performance problems in existing accelerator designs. We show that these insights can also guide developers toward optimizations that the compiler was unable to perform automatically, including a reduction by 46.9\% of total cycles for one application.</description>

      <title>EnergyTwin: A Multi-Agent System for Simulating and Coordinating Energy Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microgrids are deployed to reduce purchased grid energy, limit exposure to volatile tariffs, and ensure service continuity during disturbances. This requires coordinating heterogeneous distributed energy resources across multiple time scales and under variable conditions. Among existing tools, typically, power-system simulators capture physical behaviour but assume centralized control, while multi-agent frameworks model decentralized decision-making but represent energy with no physical grounding. In this context, the EnergyTwin is introduced, an agent-based microgrid simulation environment that couples physically grounded models with forecast-informed, rolling-horizon planning, and negotiations. Each asset is modeled as an agent, interacting with a central agent that obtains forecasts, formulates predictions, and allocates energy through contract-based interactions. EnergyTwin targets tertiary-layer decision making and is extensible for digital-twin use. Its feasibility was evaluated in a university campus microgrid scenario where multiple planning strategies were compared. Achieved results show that forecast-driven rolling-horizon planning increases local energy self-sufficiency, maintains higher battery reserves, and reduces exposure to low-resilience operating states. They demonstrate also potential of EnergyTwin as platform supporting research on resilient, negotiation-driven microgrids.</description>

      <title>SmartC2Rust: Iterative, Feedback-Driven C-to-Rust Translation via Large Language Models for Safety and Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory safety vulnerabilities remain prevalent in today's software systems and one promising solution to mitigate them is to adopt memory-safe languages such as Rust. Due to legacy code written in memory unsafe C, there is strong motivation to translate legacy C code into Rust. Prior works have already shown promise in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for such translations. However, significant challenges persist for LLM-based translation: the translated code often fails to compile, let alone reduce unsafe statements and maintain the semantic functionalities due to inherent limitations of LLMs such as limited token size and inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we design an automated C-to-Rust translation system, called SmartC2Rust, to segment and convert the C code to Rust with memory safety and semantic equivalence. The key insight is to iteratively refine the output Rust code with additional feedback, e.g., compilation errors, segmentation contexts, semantic discrepancies, and memory unsafe statements. Such feedback will gradually improve the quality of generated Rust code, thus mitigating unsafety, inconsistency, and semantic issues. Our evaluation shows that SmartC2Rust significantly decreases the unsafe statements and outperforms prior works in security and semantic equivalence.</description>

      <title>SAFE: Harnessing LLM for Scenario-Driven ADS Testing from Multimodal Crash Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) requires realistic and reproducible test scenarios, yet extracting such scenarios from multimodal crash reports remains a major challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate and lose map structure, resulting in unrealistic road layouts and vehicle behaviors. To address this, we introduce SAFE, a novel Scenario-based ADS testing Framework via multimodal Extraction, which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), knowledge-grounded prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and self-validation to improve scenario reconstruction from multimodal crash data. SAFE achieves 93.8% accuracy in extracting road network details, 80.0% for actor information, and 100% for environmental context. In human studies, SAFE outperforms LCTGen and AC3R in reconstructing consistent road networks and vehicle behaviors. Under identical ADS and simulator settings, SAFE detects 39 and 71 more safety violations than LCTGen and AC3R, respectively, and reproduces 12 more real-world crash cases than LCTGen. On 19 cases supported by AC3R, SAFE reproduces one additional crash case with statistically significant gains across five runs. It generates scenarios within 25 seconds and triggers violations after just 1 case (IDM) and 3 cases (PPO) in MetaDrive, as well as 1 case (Auto) in BeamNG.

Abstract: Programming assistants powered by large language models have improved dramatically, yet existing benchmarks still evaluate them in narrow code-generation settings. Recent efforts such as InfiBench and StackEval rely on Stack Overflow questions and remain limited to single-turn interactions, manually curated data, and isolated snippets rather than full project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark for evaluating multi-turn, project-grounded programming assistance at scale. CAB automatically constructs datasets from GitHub issues tagged as questions, using an LLM-driven pipeline that filters noise, extracts runnable contexts, builds executable containers, and verifies environment correctness. This enables continuous, automated expansion across diverse repositories without manual intervention. Using CAB, we create a testbed of 3,286 real-world issues across 214 repositories, spanning seven languages. Evaluating state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap: while models achieve 70-83% accuracy on Stack Overflow-style questions, they solve only 16.49% of CAB issues from post-training-cutoff repositories. On a manually validated subset of 149 issues, top models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5 reach only 12.08% correctness. These results highlight a fundamental challenge: current LLMs struggle to provide assistance in realistic, project-specific contexts despite strong performance on traditional Q&amp;A benchmarks. CAB provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing research in multi-turn, codebase-grounded programming agents. The benchmark and pipeline are fully automated and publicly available at https://github.com/amazon-science/CodeAssistBench/.</description>

      <title>More with Less: An Empirical Study of Turn-Control Strategies for Efficient Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16786</link>

Abstract: LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a "sweet spot", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.</description>

      <title>LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</description>

      <title>Data Race Detection by Digest-Driven Abstract Interpretation (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound static analysis can prove the absence of data races by establishing that no two conflicting memory accesses can occur at the same time. We repurpose the concept of digests -- summaries of computational histories originally introduced to bring tunable concurrency-sensitivity to thread-modular value analysis by abstract interpretation, extending this idea to race detection: We use digests to capture the conditions under which conflicting accesses may not happen in parallel. To formalize this, we give a definition of data races in the thread-modular local trace semantics and show how exclusion criteria for potential conflicts can be expressed as digests. We report on our implementation of digest-driven data race detection in the static analyzer Goblint, and evaluate it on the SV-COMP benchmark suite. Combining the lockset digest with digests reasoning on thread ids and thread joins increases the number of correctly solved tasks by more than a factor of five compared to lockset reasoning alone.</description>
