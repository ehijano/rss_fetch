      <title>On the Scaling of the Normalized Magnetic Reconnection Rate with Local and Background Plasma Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the first multi-event study of the normalized reconnection rate integrating events spanning the three primary regimes of reconnection observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. We utilize a new method for determining the normalized reconnection rate with fewer sources of uncertainty by estimating the diffusion region aspect ratio with magnetic field gradients, which are very well measured by MMS. After demonstrating our technique is valid in the guide field and asymmetric regimes of reconnection, we investigate any relationships between the normalized rate on guide field, upstream magnetic field variability, and magnetic field and density asymmetry. Our results suggest that under typical magnetospheric conditions, the normalized reconnection rate is constant, which may be significant in predicting the terrestrial effects of space weather by providing insight into the efficiency of solar wind-magnetospheric coupling.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the SiPiC Payload for Photon Detection from Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the SiPiC (SiPM Pinhole Camera) Payload is detailed. This Payload will potentially be integrated in two distinct satellite missions, which will operate in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and in a High Altitude Orbit (HAO), respectively. The SiPiC Payload has two main objectives: to test Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) as visible light sensors for stimuli originating from Earth; and to perform an in-orbit validation (IOV) of the new generation of PC104-compliant LabOSat subsystems. Preliminary measurements of the Payload's operational capabilities are performed and discussed. These include payload telemetry analysis, Field-of-View tests for the Earth imaging SiPM subsystem, and performance evaluations of the new LabOSat modules for known devices under test. The measured Angular Field of View (AFOV) for the light gathering SiPM subsystem is $(6.2 \pm 0.5)^{\mathrm{o}}$, which results in a FOV of $(4333 \pm 350)$ km on the surface of the Earth at 40000 km altitude and $(54 \pm 5)$ km at 500 km altitude.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>Observation of Alfven solitons in the solar corona using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as planetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains largely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to address this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the solar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing observational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing amplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the observed aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in facilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma, hereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A defining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and super-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that reinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby contributing to plasma heating.</description>
