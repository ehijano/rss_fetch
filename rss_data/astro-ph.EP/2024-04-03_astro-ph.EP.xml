      <title>Retrieved Atmospheres and Inferred Surface Properties for Exoplanets Using Transmission and Reflected Light Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future astrophysics missions will seek extraterrestrial life via transmission and direct imaging observations. To assess habitability and biosignatures, we need robust retrieval tools to analyze observed spectra, and infer surface and atmospheric properties with their uncertainties. We use a novel retrieval tool to assess accuracy in characterizing near-surface habitability and biosignatures via simulated transmission and direct imaging spectra, based on the Origins Space Telescope (Origins) and LUVOIR mission concepts. We assess our ability to discriminate between an Earth-like and a false-positive O$_3$ TRAPPIST-1 e with transmission spectroscopy. In reflected light, we assess the robustness of retrieval results to un-modeled cloud extinction. We find that assessing habitability using transmission spectra may be challenging due to relative insensitivity to surface temperature and near-surface H$_2$O abundances. Nonetheless, our order of magnitude H$_2$O constraints can discriminate extremely desiccated worlds. Direct imaging is insensitive to surface temperature and subject to the radius/albedo degeneracy, but this method proves highly sensitive to surface water abundance, achieving retrieval precision within 0.1% even with partial clouds. Concerning biosignatures, Origins-like transmission observations ($t=40$ hours) may detect the CO$_2$/CH$_4$ pair on M-dwarf planets and differentiate between biological and false positive O$_3$ using H$_2$O and abundant CO. In contrast, direct imaging observations with LUVOIR-A ($t=10$ hours) are better suited to constraining O$_2$ and O$_3$, and may be sensitive to wavelength-dependent water cloud features, but will struggle to detect modern Earth-like abundances of methane. For direct imaging, we weakly detect a stratospheric ozone bulge by fitting the near-UV wings of the Hartley band.</description>

      <title>Turning Spherical Cows into Spherical Cheeses: a bold and flavourful re-Interpretation of the Moon's spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese..." This line, famously uttered by Wallace to his canine sidekick Gromit in the 80s classic, may be one of the most cruelly underappreciated movie quotations of our time. Indeed, while most scientists today would simply reject Wallace's claim as preposterous, we aim to revisit his theory on the composition of our natural satellite, revealing that it may not be as implausible as the scientific consensus would have it. Through a revelatory novel analysis of existing data, we will show that very simple cheese-based models can provide a convincing explanation of the Lunar surface's spectral characteristics in the near-infrared. Using the tried and tested PLS (Partial Least Squares) method, we efficiently and reliably retrieve the concentrations of various cheese types in different locations of the Lunar surface. Our results bring to light a bold and flavourful prediction about the Moon's composition, which lays the groundwork for an important paradigm shift in planetary sciences. We urge the scientific community to take a serious notice of this piquant novel interpretation, and strongly consider it in their future models of planetary composition and formation in our solar system and beyond.</description>

      <title>A fading radius valley towards M-dwarfs, a persistent density valley across stellar types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radius valley separating super-Earths from mini-Neptunes is a fundamental benchmark for theories of planet formation and evolution. Observations show that the location of the radius valley decreases with decreasing stellar mass and with increasing orbital period. Here, we build from our previous pebble-based formation model, which, combined with photoevaporation after disc dispersal, unveiled the radius valley as a separator between rocky- and water-worlds. We expand our models for a range of stellar masses spanning from 0.1 to 1.5 $M_\odot$. We find that the location of the radius valley is well described by a power-law in stellar mass as $R_{\rm valley} = 1.8197 \, M_{\star}^{\!0.14({+0.02}/{-0.01})}$, which is in excellent agreement with observations. We also find very good agreement with the dependence of the radius valley on orbital period, both for FGK- and M-dwarfs. Additionally, we note that the radius valley gets filled towards low stellar masses, particularly at 0.1-0.4 $M_\odot$, yielding a rather flat slope in $R_{\rm valley} - P_{\rm orb}$. This is the result of orbital migration occurring at lower planet mass for less massive stars, which allows for low-mass water-worlds to reach the inner regions of the system, blurring the separation in mass (and size) between rocky- and water-worlds. Furthermore, we find that for planetary equilibrium temperatures above 400 K, the water in the volatile layer exists fully in the form of steam, puffing the planet radius up compared to condensed-water worlds. This produces an increase in planet radii of $\sim 30\%$ at 1 $M_\oplus$, and of $\sim 15\%$ at 5 $M_\oplus$, compared to condensed-water-worlds. As with Sun-like stars, pebble accretion leaves its imprint on the overall exoplanet population as a depletion of planets with intermediate compositions, carving a valley in planet density for all spectral types (abridged).</description>

      <title>CME Deflection and East-West Asymmetry of ESP Intensity in Solar Cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the East-West asymmetry in energetic storm particle (ESP) heavy ion intensities at interplanetary shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. We use observations from NASA's ACE and STEREO missions of helium (He), oxygen (O), and iron (Fe) intensities from ~0.13 to 3 MeV/nucleon. We examine the longitudinal distribution of ESP intensities and the correlation of ESP intensities with the near-Sun CME speed and the average transit CME speed for eastern and western events. We observed an East-West asymmetry reversal of ESP heavy ion intensities from SC 23 to 24. We have determined that this change in asymmetry is caused by a shift in the heliolongitude distribution of the CME speed ratio (the ratio of CME near-Sun speed to CME average transit speed) from west to east.</description>

      <title>An Informed and Systematic Method to Identify Variable mid-L dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most brown dwarfs show some level of photometric or spectral variability. However, finding the most variable dwarfs more suited for a thorough variability monitoring campaign remained a challenge until a few years ago with the design of spectral indices to find the most likely L and T dwarfs using their near-infrared single-epoch spectrum. In this work, we designed and tested near-infrared spectral indices to pre-select the most likely variable L4-L8 dwarfs, complementing the indices presented by Ashraf et al. (2022) and Oliveros-Gomez et al. (2022). We used time-resolved near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectra of an L6.0 dwarf, LP 261-75b, to design our novel spectral indices. We tested these spectral indices on 75 L4.0-L8.0 near-infrared SpeX/IRTF spectra, providing 27 new variable candidates. Our indices have a recovery rate of 80 percent and a false negative rate of 25 percent. All the known non-variable brown dwarfs were found to be non-variable by our indices. We estimated the variability fraction of our sample to be near 51 percent, which agrees with the variability fractions provided by Buenzli et al. (2014), Radigan et al. (2014), and Metchev et al. (2015) for L4-L8 dwarfs. These spectral indices may support in the future, the selection of the most likely variable directly-imaged exoplanets for studies with the James Webb Space Telescope and as well as the 30-m telescopes.</description>

      <title>VaTEST III: Validation of 8 Potential Super-Earths from TESS Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NASA's all-sky survey mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), is specifically engineered to detect exoplanets that transit bright stars. Thus far, TESS has successfully identified approximately 400 transiting exoplanets, in addition to roughly 6000 candidate exoplanets pending confirmation. In this study, we present the results of our ongoing project, the Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST). Our dedicated effort is focused on the confirmation and characterization of new exoplanets through the application of statistical validation tools. Through a combination of ground-based telescope data, high-resolution imaging, and the utilization of the statistical validation tool known as \texttt{TRICERATOPS}, we have successfully discovered eight potential super-Earths. These planets bear the designations: TOI-238b (1.61$^{+0.09} _{-0.10}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-771b (1.42$^{+0.11} _{-0.09}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-871b (1.66$^{+0.11} _{-0.11}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-1467b (1.83$^{+0.16} _{-0.15}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-1739b (1.69$^{+0.10} _{-0.08}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-2068b (1.82$^{+0.16} _{-0.15}$ R$_\oplus$), TOI-4559b (1.42$^{+0.13} _{-0.11}$ R$_\oplus$), and TOI-5799b (1.62$^{+0.19} _{-0.13}$ R$_\oplus$). Among all these planets, six of them fall within the region known as 'keystone planets,' which makes them particularly interesting for study. Based on the location of TOI-771b and TOI-4559b below the radius valley we characterized them as likely super-Earths, though radial velocity mass measurements for these planets will provide more details about their characterization. It is noteworthy that planets within the size range investigated herein are absent from our own solar system, making their study crucial for gaining insights into the evolutionary stages between Earth and Neptune.</description>

      <title>JWST near-infrared spectroscopy of the Lucy Jupiter Trojan flyby targets: Evidence for OH absorption, aliphatic organics, and CO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations obtained with the Near Infrared Spectrograph on JWST of the five Jupiter Trojans that will be visited by the Lucy spacecraft -- the Patroclus-Menoetius binary, Eurybates, Orus, Leucus, and Polymele. The measured 1.7-5.3 $\mu$m reflectance spectra, which provide increased wavelength coverage, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio over previous ground-based spectroscopy, reveal several distinct absorption features. We detect a broad OH band centered at 3 $\mu$m that is most prominent on the less-red objects Eurybates, Patroclus-Menoetius, and Polymele. An additional absorption feature at 3.3-3.6 $\mu$m, indicative of aliphatic organics, is systematically deeper on the red objects Orus and Leucus. The collisional fragment Eurybates is unique in displaying an absorption band at 4.25 $\mu$m that we attribute to bound or trapped CO$_2$. Comparisons with other solar system small bodies reveal broad similarities in the 2.7-3.6 $\mu$m bands with analogous features on Centaurs, Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), and the active asteroid 238P. In the context of recent solar system evolution models, which posit that the Trojans initially formed in the outer solar system, the significant attenuation of the 2.7-3.6 $\mu$m absorption features on Trojans relative to KBOs may be the result of secondary thermal processing of the Trojans' surfaces at the higher temperatures of the Jupiter region. The CO$_2$ band manifested on the surface of Eurybates suggests that CO$_2$ may be a major constituent in the bulk composition of Trojans, but resides in the subsurface or deeper interior and is largely obscured by refractory material that formed from the thermophysical processes that were activated during their inward migration.</description>

      <title>Populating The Milky Way: Characterising Planet Demographics by Combining Galaxy Formation Simulations and Planet Population Synthesis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar populations and their distribution differ widely across the Galaxy, which is likely to affect planet demographics. Our local neighbourhood is dominated by young, metal-rich stars in the galactic thin disc, while the stellar halo and galactic bulge host a large fraction of older, metal-poor stars. We study the impact of these variations on planet populations in different regions of the Galaxy by combining a high-resolution galaxy formation simulation with state-of-the-art planet population synthesis models.
  We construct a population model to estimate occurrence rates of different planet types, based on the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis by Emsenhuber et al., 2021. We apply this to a simulated Milky Way--Analogue in the HESTIA galaxy formation simulation. We study the planet occurrence rate in the metal-rich regions of the inner Galaxy, i.e. in the galactic bulge and thin disc, and contrast them to the frequencies in the more distant, metal-poor region like the thick disc and stellar halo.
  We find that the planet demographics in the metal-poor regions of the Milky Way-Analogue, differ strongly from the planet populations in the more distant, metal-poor regions. The occurrence rate of giant planets ($&gt;300 M_\bigoplus$) is 10 to 20 times larger in the thin disc compared to the thick disc, driven by the low amounts of solid material available for planet formation around metal-poor stars. Similarly, low-mass Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars are most abundant in the thick disc, being 1.5 times more frequent than in the thin disc. Moreover, low-mass planets are expected to be abundant throughout the galaxy, from the central regions to the outer halo, due to their formation processes being less dependent on stellar metallicity. The planet populations differ more strongly around Sun-like stars compared to dwarfs with masses 0.3 - 0.5 $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive High-resolution Chemical Spectroscopy of Barnard's Star with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determination of fundamental parameters of stars impacts all fields of astrophysics, from galaxy evolution to constraining the internal structure of exoplanets. This paper presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of Barnard's star that compares an exceptionally high-quality (an average signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$1000 in the entire domain), high-resolution NIR spectrum taken with CFHT/SPIRou to PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. The observed spectrum shows thousands of lines not identified in the models with a similar large number of lines present in the model but not in the observed data. We also identify several other caveats such as continuum mismatch, unresolved contamination and spectral lines significantly shifted from their expected wavelengths, all of these can be a source of bias for abundance determination. Out of $&gt;10^4$ observed lines in the NIR that could be used for chemical spectroscopy, we identify a short list of a few hundred lines that are reliable. We present a novel method for determining the effective temperature and overall metallicity of slowly-rotating M dwarfs that uses several groups of lines as opposed to bulk spectral fitting methods. With this method, we infer $T_{eff}$ = 3231 $\pm$ 21 K for Barnard's star, consistent with the value of 3238 $\pm$ 11 K inferred from the interferometric method. We also provide abundance measurements of 15 different elements for Barnard's star, including the abundances of four elements (K, O, Y, Th) never reported before for this star. This work emphasizes the need to improve current atmosphere models to fully exploit the NIR domain for chemical spectroscopy analysis.</description>
