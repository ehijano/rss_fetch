      <title>On the rate of convergence in the weak invariance principle for dependent random variables with applications to Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an invariance principle for non-stationary random processes and establish a rate of convergence under a new type of mixing condition. The dependence is exponentially decaying in the gap between the past and the future and is controlled by an assumption on the characteristic function of the finite dimensional increments of the process. The distinct feature of the new mixing condition is that the dependence increases exponentially in the dimension of the increments. The proposed mixing property is particularly suited for processes whose behavior can be described in terms of spectral properties of some related family of operators. Several examples are discussed. We also work out explicit expressions for the constants involved in the bounds. When applied to Markov chains our result specifies the dependence of the constants on the properties of the underlying Banach space and on the initial state of the chain.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for critical branching processes in a finite state space Markovian environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(Z_n)_{n\geq 0}$ be a critical branching process in a random environment defined by a Markov chain $(X_n)_{n\geq 0}$ with values in a finite state space $\mathbb X$. Let $ S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \ln f_{X_k}'(1)$ be the Markov walk associated to $(X_n)_{n\geq 0}$, where $f_i$ is the offspring generating function when the environment is $i \in \mathbb X$. Conditioned on the event $\{ Z_n&gt;0\}$, we show the non degeneracy of limit law of the normalized number of particles ${Z_n}/{e^{S_n}}$ and determine the limit of the law of $\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n}} $ jointly with $X_n$. Based on these results we establish a Yaglom-type theorem which specifies the limit of the joint law of $ \log Z_n$ and $X_n$ given $Z_n&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Stationary states for stable processes with partial resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a $d$-dimensional stochastic process $\mathbf{X}$ which arises from a L\'evy process $\mathbf{Y}$ by partial resetting, that is the position of the process $\mathbf{X}$ at a Poisson moment equals $c$ times its position right before the moment, and it develops as $\mathbf{Y}$ between these two consecutive moments, $c \in (0, 1)$.
  We focus on $\mathbf{Y}$ being a strictly $\alpha$-stable process with $\alpha\in (0,2]$ having a transition density: We analyze properties of the transition density $p$ of the process $\mathbf{X}$. We establish a series representation of $p$. We prove its convergence as time goes to infinity (ergodicity), and we show that the limit $\rho_{\mathbf{Y}}$ (density of the ergodic measure) can be expressed by means of the transition density of the process $\mathbf{Y}$ starting from zero, which results in closed concise formulae for its moments. We show that the process $\mathbf{X}$ reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, we check that $p$ satisfies the Fokker--Planck equation, and we confirm the harmonicity of $\rho_{\mathbf{Y}}$ with respect to the adjoint generator.
  In detail, we discuss the following cases: Brownian motion, isotropic and $d$-cylindrical $\alpha$-stable processes for $\alpha \in (0,2)$, and $\alpha$-stable subordinator for $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We find the asymptotic behavior of $p(t;x,y)$ as $t\to +\infty$ while $(t,y)$ stays in a certain space-time region. For Brownian motion, we discover a phase transition, that is a change of the asymptotic behavior of $p(t;0,y)$ with respect to $\rho_{\mathbf{Y}}(y)$.</description>

      <title>On the integrability of the supremum of stochastic volatility models and other martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to determine the expectation of the supremum of the price process in stochastic volatility models. It can be applied to the rough Bergomi model, avoiding the need to discuss finiteness of higher moments. Our motivation stems from the theory of American option pricing, as an integrable supremum implies the existence of an optimal stopping time for any linearly bounded payoff. Moreover, we survey the literature on martingales with non-integrable supremum, and give a new construction that yields uniformly integrable martingales with this property.</description>

      <title>Quantitative delocalisation for the Gaussian and $q$-SOS long-range chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to study quantitatively the localisation/delocalisation properties of the discrete Gaussian chain with long-range interactions. Specifically, we consider the discrete Gaussian chain of length $N$, with Dirichlet boundary condition, range exponent $\alpha \in (1 , \infty)$ and inverse temperature $\beta \in (0,\infty)$, and show that:
  - For $\alpha \in (2 ,3)$ and $\beta \in (0 , \infty)$, the fluctuations of the chain are at least of order $N^{\frac{1}{2}(\alpha - 2)}$;
  - For $\alpha = 3$ and $\beta \in (0 , \infty)$, the fluctuations of the chain are of order $\sqrt{N / \ln N}$ (sharp upper and lower bounds up to multiplicative constants are derived).
  Combined with the results of Kjaer-Hilhorst, Fr\"{o}hlich-Zegarlinski and Garban, these estimates provide an (almost) complete picture for the localisation/delocalisation of the discrete Gaussian chain. The proofs are based on graph surgery techniques which have been recently developed by van Engelenburg-Lis and Aizenman-Harel-Peled-Shapiro to study the phase transitions of two dimensional integer-valued height functions (and of their dual spin systems).
  Additionally, by combining the previous strategy with a technique introduced by Sellke, we are able extend the method to study the $q$-SOS long-range chain with exponent $q \in (0 , 2)$ and show that, for any inverse temperature $\beta\in (0, \infty)$ and any range exponent $\alpha \in (1 , \infty)$:
  - The fluctuations of the chain are at least of order $N^{\frac{1}{q}(\alpha -2) \wedge \frac{1}{2}}$;
  - The fluctuations of the chain are at most of order $N^{\left( \frac{1}{q}\alpha - 1 \right) \wedge \frac 12}$.</description>

      <title>Sampling inverse subordinators and subdiffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a method to exactly sample the trajectories of inverse subordinators (in the sense of the finite dimensional distributions), jointly with the undershooting or overshooting process, is provided. The method applies to general subordinators with infinite activity. The (random) running times of these algorithms have finite moments and explicit bounds for the expectations are provided. Additionally, the Monte Carlo approximation of functionals of subdiffusive processes (in the form of time-changed Feller processes) is considered where a central limit theorem and the Berry-Esseen bounds are proved. The approximation of time-changed It\^o diffusions is also studied. The strong error, as a function of the time step, is explicitly evaluated demonstrating the strong convergence, and the algorithm's complexity is provided. The Monte Carlo approximation of functionals and its properties for the approximate method is studied as well.</description>

      <title>The particle approximation of quasi-stationary distributions. Part~I: concentration bounds in the uniform case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean-field particle approximations of normalized Feynman-Kac semi-groups, usually called Fleming-Viot or Feynman-Kac particle systems. Assuming various large time stability properties of the semi-group uniformly in the initial condition, we provide explicit time-uniform $L^p$ and exponential bounds (a new result) with the expected rate in terms of sample size. This work is based on a stochastic backward error analysis (similar to the classical concept of numerical analysis) of the measure-valued Markov particle estimator, an approach that simplifies methods previously used for time-uniform $L^p$ estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a well-known conjecture in $\beta$-models and in their discrete counterpart that, generically, external potentials should be ``off-critical'' (or, equivalently, ``regular''). Exploiting the connection between minimizing measures and thin obstacle problems, we give a positive answer to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Dimension jump at the uniqueness threshold for percolation in $\infty+d$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider percolation on $T\times \mathbb{Z}^d$, the product of a regular tree of degree $k\geq 3$ with the hypercubic lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. It is known that this graph has $0&lt;p_c&lt;p_u&lt;1$, so that there are non-trivial regimes in which percolation has $0$, $\infty$, and $1$ infinite clusters a.s., and it was proven by Schonmann (1999) that there are infinitely many infinite clusters a.s. at the uniqueness threshold $p=p_u$. We strengthen this result by showing that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of accumulation points of each infinite cluster in the boundary of the tree has a jump discontinuity from at most $1/2$ to $1$ at the uniqueness threshold $p_u$. We also prove that various other critical thresholds including the $L^2$ boundedness threshold $p_{2\to 2}$ coincide with $p_u$ for such products, which are the first nonamenable examples proven to have this property. All our results apply more generally to products of trees with arbitrary infinite amenable Cayley graphs and to the lamplighter on the tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the sensitivity at the origin of the distributional robust optimization problem in the context of a model generated by a mean field stochastic differential equation. We adapt the finite dimensional argument developed by Bartl, Drapeau, Obloj \&amp; Wiesel to our framework involving the infinite dimensional gradient of the solution of the mean field SDE with respect to its initial data. We revisit the derivation of this gradient process as previously introduced by Buckdahn, Li \&amp; Peng, and we complement the existing properties so as to satisfy the requirement of our main result.</description>

      <title>On cutoff via rigidity for high dimensional curved diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a cutoff phenomenon occurs in high dimension for certain positively curved overdamped Langevin diffusions in the Euclidean space, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and its Dyson version. In this note, we provide a structural explanation of this phenomenon, and we extend the result to a wide class of non-Gaussian and non-product models with a convex interaction. The key observation is a relation to a spectral rigidity result of Cheng and Zhou, linked to the presence of a Gaussian factor. We formulate the phenomenon using a Wasserstein coupling distance, and we deduce from it the formulation for total variation distance and relative entropy divergence. Furthermore, we discuss a natural extension to Riemannian manifolds, and ask about a possible extension or stability by perturbation.</description>

      <title>Small-time central limit theorems for stochastic Volterra integral equations and their Markovian lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study small-time central limit theorems for stochastic Volterra integral equations with H\"older continuous coefficients and general locally square integrable Volterra kernels. We prove the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions, a functional CLT, and limit theorems for smooth transformations of the process, which covers a large class of Volterra kernels that includes rough models based on Riemann-Liouville kernels with short- and long-range dependencies. To illustrate our results, we derive asymptotic pricing formulae for digital calls on the realized variance in three different regimes. The latter provides a robust and model-independent pricing method for small maturities in rough volatility models. Finally, for the case of completely monotone kernels, we introduce a flexible framework of Hilbert space-valued Markovian lifts and derive analogous limit theorems for such lifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of Hawkes processes whose excitation measures may depend on the generation, and study its scaling limits in the near-unstable limiting regime. The limiting random measures, characterized via a nonlinear convolutional equation, form a family parameterized by a pair consisting of a locally finite measure and a geometrically infinitely divisible probability distribution on the positive real line. These measures can be interpreted as generalizations of the Feller diffusion and fractional Feller (CIR) processes, but also allow for the "driving noise" associated to general L\' evy-type operators of order at most $1$, including fractional derivatives of any order $\alpha&gt;0$ (formally corresponding to possibly negative Hurst parameters).</description>

      <title>A moment approach for the convergence of spatial branching processes to the Continuum Random Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general class of branching processes in discrete time, where particles have types belonging to a Polish space and reproduce independently according to their type. If the process is critical and the mean distribution of types converges for large times, we prove that the tree structure of the process converges to the Brownian Continuum Random Tree, under a moment assumption. We provide a general approach to prove similar invariance principles for branching processes, which relies on deducing the convergence of the genealogy from computing its moments. These are obtained using a new many-to-few formula, which provides an expression for the moments of order $k$ of a branching process in terms of a Markov chain indexed by a uniform tree with $k$ leaves.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for the Volume of Random Projections and Sections of $\ell_p^N$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{B}_p^N$ be the $N$-dimensional unit ball corresponding to the $\ell_p$-norm. For each $N\in\mathbb N$ we sample a uniform random subspace $E_N$ of fixed dimension $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and consider the volume of $\mathbb{B}_p^N$ projected onto $E_N$ or intersected with $E_N$. We also consider geometric quantities other than the volume such as the intrinsic volumes or the dual volumes. In this setting we prove central limit theorems, moderate deviation principles, and large deviation principles as $N\to\infty$. Our results provide a complete asymptotic picture. In particular, they generalize and complement a result of Paouris, Pivovarov, and Zinn [A central limit theorem for projections of the cube, Probab. Theory Related Fields. 159 (2014), 701-719] and another result of Adamczak, Pivovarov, and Simanjuntak [Limit theorems for the volumes of small codimensional random sections of $\ell_p^n$-balls, Ann. Probab. 52 (2024), 93-126].</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Entanglement-assisted Quantum Communication Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a queueing model for quantum communication networks, a rapidly growing field of research inspired by its technological promise and recent experimental successes. The model consists of a primary queue and a service queue where Bell pairs are formed and stored. The Bell pairs are by nature extremely short-lived rendering the service queue (the quantum queue) much faster than the primary queue. We study the asymptotic behaviour of this multi-scale queueing system utilizing the theory of stochastic averaging principle. We prove a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN) and a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT) for the standard queue averaging the dynamics of the fast service queue. Our proofs are probablistic and rely on the stochastic analysis of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the convergence of the discrete Makeenko-Migdal equations for the Yang-Mills model on $(\varepsilon \mathbf{Z})^{2}$ to their continuum counterparts on the plane, in an appropriate sense. The key step in the proof is identifying the limits of the contributions from deformations as the area derivatives of the Wilson loop expectations.</description>

      <title>Moment-optimal finitary isomorphism for i.i.d. processes of equal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finitary isomorphism theorem, due to Keane and Smorodinsky, raised the natural question of how "finite" the isomorphism can be, in terms of moments of the coding radius. More precisely, for which values does there exist an isomorphism between any two i.i.d. processes of equal entropy, with coding radii exhibiting finite t-moments? [3, 4]. Parry [13] and Krieger [10] showed that those finite moments must be lesser than 1 in general, and Harvey and Peres [5] showed that they must be lesser than 1/2 in general. However, the question for the range between 0 and 1/2 remained open, and in fact no general construction of an isomorphism was shown to exhibit any non trivial finite moments. In the present work we settle this problem, showing that between any two aperiodic Markov processes (and i.i.d. processes in particular) of the same entropy, there exists an isomorphism f with coding radii exhibiting finite t-moments for all t in (0,1/2). The isomorphism is constructed explicitly, and the tails of the radii are shown to be optimal up to a poly-logarithmic factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the behavior of a multi-agent system driven by the interactions of agents within a competitive environment. To achieve this, we describe the transition probabilities that underlie the system's stochastic nature. We also derive the Fokker-Planck equations for the density distribution of the number of agents in the system and solve these equations for specific cases.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the variance of both smooth linear statistics and rough linear statistics (counting statistics) of random normal matrices. The two classical ensembles of random matrices, the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) and the complex Ginibre ensemble, enjoy an exact map to the ground state of noninteracting Fermions in a harmonic trap in one, respectively two dimensions. Both feature that the variance of the number of Fermions (the number variance) in a set $A$, and the respective entanglement entropy are proportional. For the Ginibre ensemble this statement about the entropy was known for radial symmetric sets $A$, and we prove it in generality for subsets $A$ of the bulk, thus establishing a holographic principle. Moreover, for generic random normal matrix ensembles depending on some potential $V$, not necessarily exhibiting radial symmetry, we show that for large matrix size $n$ the number variance is proportional to the circumference of $A$, $\sim\sqrt{n}|\partial A|$. A special focus is on the variance of linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble, which interpolates between the GUE and Ginibre ensemble, in various regimes of non-Hermiticity, where we enlarge the concept of weak non-Hermiticity to mesoscopic scales. Within the elliptic Ginibre ensemble we prove that for smooth test functions $f$ its variance interpolates between that of the GUE and Ginibre ensemble. The interpolation depends on two positive parameters, the rescaling $\alpha$ of the weak non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau=1-\kappa n^{-\alpha}$, and the rescaling $\gamma$ of the test function $f(n^\gamma z)$, for a continuous range of values of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. In the mesoscopic regime and when $\alpha=\gamma&lt;1$, we prove an interpolating central limit theorem with an adaptation of the method of Ward identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the universal approximation theorem for rough path functionals, introducing a polynomial-based approximation class. We extend universal approximation to non-geometric rough paths within the tensor algebra. This development addresses critical needs in finance, where no-arbitrage conditions necessitate It\^o integration. Furthermore, our findings motivate a hypothesis for payoff functionals in financial markets, allowing straightforward analysis of signature payoffs proposed in \cite{arribas2018derivativespricingusingsignature}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.10684v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Branching processes in a random environment are natural generalisations of Galton-Watson processes. In this paper we analyse the asymptotic decay of the survival probability for a sequence of slightly supercritical branching processes in an iid random environment, where the offspring expectation converges from above to $1$. We prove that Haldane's asymptotics, known from classical Galton-Watson processes, turns up again in the random environment case, provided that one stays away from the critical/subcritical regime. A central building block is a connection to and a limit theorem for perpetuities with asymptotically vanishing interest rates.</description>

      <title>The heat flow conjecture for polynomials and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the roots of a polynomial of degree $N$, when the polynomial itself is evolving according to the heat flow. We propose a general conjecture for the large-$N$ limit of this evolution. Specifically, we propose (1) that the log potential of the limiting root distribution should evolve according to a certain first-order, nonlinear PDE, and (2) that the limiting root distribution at a general time should be the push-forward of the initial distribution under a certain explicit transport map. These results should hold for sufficiently small times, that is, until singularities begin to form.
  We offer three lines of reasoning in support of our conjecture. First, from a random matrix perspective, the conjecture is supported by a deformation theorem for the second moment of the characteristic polynomial of certain random matrix models. Second, from a dynamical systems perspective, the conjecture is supported by the computation of the second derivative of the roots with respect to time, which is formally small before singularities form. Third, from a PDE perspective, the conjecture is supported by the exact PDE satisfied by the log potential of the empirical root distribution of the polynomial, which formally converges to the desired PDE as $N\rightarrow \infty.$ We also present a "multiplicative" version of the the conjecture, supported by similar arguments.
  Finally, we verify rigorously that the conjectures hold at the level of the holomorphic moments.</description>

      <title>On questions of uniqueness for the vacant set of Wiener sausages and Brownian interlacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider connectivity properties of the vacant set of (random) ensembles of Wiener sausages in $\mathbb R^d$ in the transient dimensions $d \geq 3$. We prove that the vacant set of Brownian interlacements contains at most one infinite connected component almost surely. For finite ensembles of Wiener sausages, we provide sharp polynomial bounds on the probability that their vacant set contains at least $2$ connected components in microscopic balls. The main proof ingredient is a sharp polynomial bound on the probability that several Brownian motions visit jointly all hemiballs of the unit ball while avoiding a slightly smaller ball.</description>

Abstract: We study visibility inside the vacant set of three models in $\mathbb R^d$ with slow decay of spatial correlations: Brownian interlacements, Poisson cylinders and Boolean model. For each of them, we obtain sharp asymptotic bounds on the probability of visibility to distance $r$ in some direction in terms of the probability of visibility to distance $r$ in a given direction. In dimensions $d\geq 4$, the ratio of the two probabilities has the same scaling $r^{2(d-1)}$ for all three models, but in lower dimensions the scalings are different. In particular, we improve some main results from arXiv:0905.4874 and arXiv:1709.09052.</description>

      <title>Golden parachutes under the threat of accidents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a continuous-time contracting model that extends the problem introduced by Sannikov and later rigorously analysed by Possama\"{i} and Touzi. In our model, a principal hires a risk-averse agent to carry out a project. Specifically, the agent can perform two different tasks, namely to increase the instantaneous growth rate of the project's value, and to reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring. In order to compensate for these costly actions, the principal offers a continuous stream of payments throughout the entire duration of a contract, which concludes at a random time, potentially resulting in a lump-sum payment. We examine the consequences stemming from the introduction of accidents, modelled by a compound Poisson process that negatively impact the project's value. Furthermore, we investigate whether certain economic scenarii are still characterised by a golden parachute as in Sannikov's model. A golden parachute refers to a situation where the agent stops working and subsequently receives a compensation, which may be either a lump-sum payment leading to termination of the contract or a continuous stream of payments, thereby corresponding to a pension.</description>

Abstract: We study vantage-point trees constructed using an independent sample from the uniform distribution on a fixed convex body $K$ in $(\mathbb{R}^d,\|\cdot\|)$, where $\|\cdot\|$ is an arbitrary norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that a sequence of sets, associated with the left boundary of a vantage-point tree, forms a recurrent Harris chain on the space of convex bodies in $(\mathbb{R}^d,\|\cdot\|)$. The limiting object is a ball polyhedron, that is, an a.s.~finite intersection of closed balls in $(\mathbb{R}^d,\|\cdot\|)$ of possibly different radii. As a consequence, we derive a limit theorem for the length of the leftmost path of a vantage-point tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if one drives the KPZ equation by the derivative of a space-time white noise smoothened out at scale $\varepsilon \ll 1$ and multiplied by $\varepsilon^{3/4}$ then, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, solutions converge to the Cole-Hopf solutions to the KPZ equation driven by space-time white noise.
  In the same vein, we also show that if one drives an SDE by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H &lt; 1/4$, smoothened out at scale $\varepsilon \ll 1$ and multiplied by $\varepsilon^{1/4-H}$ then, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, solutions converge to an SDE driven by white noise. The mechanism giving rise to both results is the same, but the proof techniques differ substantially.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a notion of vague convergence for random marked metric measure spaces. Our main result shows that convergence of the moments of order $k \ge 1$ of a random marked metric measure space is sufficient to obtain its vague convergence in the Gromov-weak topology. This result improves on previous methods of moments that also require convergence of the moment of order $k=0$, which in applications to critical branching processes amounts to estimating a survival probability. We also derive two useful companion results, namely a continuous mapping theorem and an approximation theorem for vague convergence of random marked metric measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the long-term behavior of a class of $\Lambda$-Wright--Fisher processes incorporating frequency-dependent selection, coordinated (bidirectional) selection, as well as individual and coordinated mutation. Our primary analytical tool is Bernstein duality, a generalization of moment duality. We introduce the corresponding dual process and establish the relevant duality relation. Without mutation, this work complements earlier studies that employed moment duality, Siegmund duality or other methods to classify the long-term behavior of similar processes. Notably, the current analysis encompasses parameter regimes that model bidirectional selection, a scenario that has proven challenging to analyze using moment duality. In the presence of mutation, we establish the ergodic properties of the process.</description>

      <title>Exact simulation of the first-passage time of SDEs to time-dependent thresholds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) is a fundamental concept in stochastic processes, representing the time it takes for a process to reach a specified threshold for the first time. Often, considering a time-dependent threshold is essential for accurately modeling stochastic processes, as it provides a more accurate and adaptable framework. In this paper, we extend an existing Exact simulation method developed for constant thresholds to handle time-dependent thresholds. Our proposed approach utilizes the FPT of Brownian motion and accepts it for the FPT of a given process with some probability, which is determined using Girsanov's transformation. This method eliminates the need to simulate entire paths over specific time intervals, avoids time-discretization errors, and directly simulates the first-passage time. We present results demonstrating the method's effectiveness, including the extension to time-dependent thresholds, an analysis of its time complexity, comparisons with existing methods through numerical examples, and its application to predicting spike times in a neuron.</description>

      <title>Permutation recovery of spikes in noisy high-dimensional tensor estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow in high dimensions for the multi-spiked tensor problem, where the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors (spikes) from noisy Gaussian tensor observations. Specifically, we analyze the maximum likelihood estimation procedure, which involves optimizing a highly nonconvex random function. We determine the sample complexity required for gradient flow to efficiently recover all spikes, without imposing any assumptions on the separation of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). More precisely, our results provide the sample complexity required to guarantee recovery of the spikes up to a permutation. Our work builds on our companion paper [Ben Arous, Gerbelot, Piccolo 2024], which studies Langevin dynamics and determines the sample complexity and separation conditions for the SNRs necessary for ensuring exact recovery of the spikes (where the recovered permutation matches the identity). During the recovery process, the correlations between the estimators and the hidden vectors increase in a sequential manner. The order in which these correlations become significant depends on their initial values and the corresponding SNRs, which ultimately determines the permutation of the recovered spikes.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework of mass transport between vector-valued measures, which will be called simultaneous optimal transport (SOT). The new framework is motivated by the need to transport resources of different types simultaneously, i.e., in single trips, from specified origins to destinations; similarly, in economic matching, one needs to couple two groups, e.g., buyers and sellers, by equating supplies and demands of different goods at the same time. The mathematical structure of simultaneous transport is very different from the classic setting of optimal transport, leading to many new challenges. The Monge and Kantorovich formulations are contrasted and connected. Existence conditions and duality formulas are established. More interestingly, by connecting SOT to a natural relaxation of martingale optimal transport (MOT), we introduce the MOT-SOT parity, which allows for explicit solutions of SOT in many interesting cases.</description>

      <title>Covariance-modulated optimal transport and gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the dynamical optimal transport problem in which the energy to be minimised is modulated by the covariance matrix of the distribution. Such transport metrics arise naturally in mean-field limits of certain ensemble Kalman methods for solving inverse problems. We show that the transport problem splits into two coupled minimization problems: one for the evolution of mean and covariance of the interpolating curve and one for its shape. The latter consists in minimising the usual Wasserstein length under the constraint of maintaining fixed mean and covariance along the interpolation. We analyse the geometry induced by this modulated transport distance on the space of probabilities as well as the dynamics of the associated gradient flows. Those show better convergence properties in comparison to the classical Wasserstein metric in terms of exponential convergence rates independent of the Gaussian target. On the level of the gradient flows a similar splitting into the evolution of moments and shapes of the distribution can be observed.</description>
