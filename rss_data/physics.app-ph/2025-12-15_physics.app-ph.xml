      <title>Gate-controlled analog memcapacitance in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface-based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current memcapacitor implementations typically demand complex fabrication processes or depend on organic materials exhibiting poor environmental stability and reproducibility. Here, we demonstrate memcapacitor structures utilizing a quasi 2-dimensional electron gas, formed at the crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface, as electrodes and SiO2/SrTiO3 as dielectric layer. The observed memcapacitance originates from the charge localization in a lateral floating gate, while an applied gate voltage enables reversible tuning of the device capacitance. Furthermore, preprogrammed or erased gate biases enable controllable shifts of the capacitance hysteresis window toward positive or negative bias, leading to an enlarged capacitance gap at zero bias. A memcapacitor model developed for this system reproduces the main features of the experimental capacitance hysteresis, capturing the effects of charge fluctuations and dielectric frequency modulation within the oxide layer. The demonstrated low-voltage operation and gate tunability of oxide interface-based memcapacitors highlight their potential for power-efficient, capacitor-based neuromorphic and synaptic electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Electrical Stability of Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 and NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the electrical characteristics comparison study between Cr2O3 and NiOx based heterojunction diodes (HJD) on halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown \b{eta}-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers. Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios &gt;10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 m{\Omega}*cm^2 and 12.05 m{\Omega}*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Elastic Metasurface Design for Advanced Wave Manipulation via a Direct Wave-Shaping Topology Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic metasurfaces offer precise control over elastic waves for applications such as vibration isolation, sensing, and imaging. However, achieving high-efficiency and scattering-free performance with complex functionalities remains a fundamental challenge. While conventional Generalized Snell's Law (GSL) designs suffer from inherent inefficiencies and parasitic scattering, recent alternatives--including impedance-matching methods and diffraction-grating-based metagratings--have sought to overcome these drawbacks. While efficiency improvement has been demonstrated, both methods are limited in generating complex wavefields such as focusing. Here, we propose a direct wave-shaping (DWS) topology optimization framework that bypasses these intermediate concepts and automates the design of high-performance, monolithic elastic metasurfaces. To mitigate the high computational expense, we parameterize the geometry with movable, deformable and interactable elliptical voids, thereby drastically reducing the design variables while enabling holistic optimization that inherently accounts for nonlocal inter-cell couplings. We demonstrate the framework by designing metasurfaces for challenging tasks including high-efficiency longitudinal-to-transverse wave conversion with large-angle beam steering, wavelength-multiplexed beam steering, and both reflective and transmissive metalenses with numerical apertures exceeding 0.99. Compared to state-of-the-art gradient-index, impedance-based, and hybrid designs, our metasurfaces consistently exhibit superior efficiency, significantly reduced spurious scattering, and enhanced focusing capability, with the most demanding transmissive metalens validated experimentally. This work establishes a scalable and computationally efficient pathway to realizing practical, high-performance elastic metasurfaces for advanced wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Response times of two-dimensional photodetectors limited by intrinsic resistance and capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most contemporary architectures of photodetectors based on two-dimensional materials include global gates for carrier density control and local p-n junctions in the channel. We study the dependence of photocurrent in such detectors on the light modulation frequency, fully taking into account the effects of distributed resistance and gate-channel capacitance. The decay of photocurrent with modulation frequency governs the response time. We find that the maximum modulation frequency is largely determined by the position of light-sensitive junction with respect to the middle of the channel. Largest modulation frequency is achieved for junctions in immediate vicinity of either source or drain contacts, while fast roll-off of the modulation characteristic is observed for junction in the middle of the channel.</description>

      <title>Thermochemical and elemental characterization of aromatic seed residues for solid biofuel applications in a circular economy context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the energy valorization potential of 16 aromatic seed residues (ASW), a by-product generated after essential oil extraction from Mediterranean aromatic and medicinal plants. Driven by the increasing demand for natural bioactive ingredients and the expansion of aromatic crop production, large amounts of residual biomass remain underutilized. Their incorporation into thermochemical conversion routes aligns with circular economy strategies, offering opportunities for renewable energy generation, waste minimization, and the development of value-added bioenergy products. The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive thermochemical, elemental, and structural assessment of ASW to determine their suitability for solid biofuel production (pellets, briquettes), pyrolysis for bio-oil generation, and biochar applications. The samples were analyzed under standardized ISO methodologies to ensure comparability and adherence to industrial fuel quality requirements.</description>

      <title>Towards Breath Based Diagnostics via Water-mediated Capture of Synthetic Breath Biomarkers in SERS-active Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are valuable health indicators, with synthetic breath biomarkers offering rapid and disease specific diagnostics. However, their &lt;100 ppb level exhalation requires mass spectrometry, limiting clinical integration. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers a portable, cost-effective alternative. Yet, detecting synthetic breath biomarkers, with inherently low Raman cross-sections, at &lt;100 ppb remains challenging. We demonstrate SERS detection down to clinically relevant 10 ppb via water-mediated trapping in hydroxylated nanoporous silica-coated plasmonic nanogaps, using pentafluoropropylamine (PFP) as a representative synthetic breath biomarker. Uniform nanogaps, with &gt;1000 times electric field enhancement, were generated between a gold film and gold-silica core-shell nanoparticle assemblies using electric field-driven evaporation. Oxygen plasma treatment hydroxylated the silica, enabling water-mediated hydrogen bonding that strengthened PFP adsorption, confirmed by density functional theory. This mechanism improved SERS sensitivity by 10000 fold, enabling ppb level PFP detection in mouse bronchial fluid and establishing a VOC capturing SERS platform for breath-based diagnostics.</description>

Abstract: We report validation tests of a calcium atomic beam source manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). We quantitatively evaluated the surface quality and elemental composition of the printed part and defined reference parameters for reliable operation in ultra-high vacuum. Safe operating conditions of the atomic oven were derived from simulations and experimental measurements. The ability of the device to deliver an atomic beam to the main experimental region, the electron/ion trap, was verified via atomic fluorescence imaging.</description>

      <title>High-velocity optothermal whirlpool actuation at the air-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a meniscus lifted above a free water surface by an optical fiber delivering near infrared radiation, the upper confinement of the heated buoyant liquid amplifies the surface temperature gradient, driving particularly strong thermocapillary effects. When the temperature gradient within the meniscus becomes very large, the stationary convection flow destabilizes in a periodic pattern of surface hydrothermal waves. We show that these light fueled waves can be controlled to a large extent by acting on the system parameters, and harnessed to propel buoyant macroparticles along stable closed trajectories at exceptionally high speeds. With 20 mW of input power at 1550 nm, we observe fast linear oscillations of 0.1 to 1 mm particles with peak velocities up to 2 cm/s and a whirlpool-like stable orbital motion with rotation rate up to 600 rpm, the largest reported so far for optothermal actuation. These findings establish a new efficient method for contactless actuation on liquid surfaces with direct application in microfluidics and in the realization of efficient light powered micromotors. At the same time, the proposed fiber meniscus configuration provides a simple and adaptable platform for studying optothermal fluid instabilities and for generating and controlling surface thermocapillary waves.</description>

      <title>Impact of interdigitated electrodes design on the low frequency and random telegraph noise of single-layer graphene micro ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High performance devices consisting of interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) on top of single-layer graphene (SLG) are candidates with favorable prospects for sensing applications. Graphene micro ribbons (GMRs) of various widths and IDE design geometries were fabricated and experimentally examined regarding their low-frequency noise (LFN) behavior. Measurements revealed a 1/f behavior and different kinds of trap activity behind it, which were studied through the analysis of random telegraph noise (RTN) signals. Our investigation suggests that adjusting the geometrical characteristics of either the GMR width or the IDE topology can significantly influence the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SLG-based electronics. On the bright side, the results of our study can provide useful guidelines for fabrication decisions to maximize the SNR.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-order exceptional points in a nanomechanical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) govern non-Hermitian system dynamics through their enriched and sharpened spectral topology, yet the intrinsic topological fragility hinders robust experimental realization. Here, we present a scalable architecture that implements arbitrary-order EPs via a recurrent network comprising a single nanomechanical resonator and unlimited virtual resonators. We experimentally realize mechanical EPs up to the seventh order and confirm this architecture's scalability. Moreover, we reveal that the fundamental noise component and the measured signal share the same system coupling channel and thus undergo identical root-response amplification near EPs of arbitrary order, consistent with our signal-to-noise ratio measurements. Our work establishes a general platform for exploring higher-order EP-based phenomena while clarifying the fundamental boundary of non-Hermitian sensitivity enhancement across diverse physical systems.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned global glacier ice volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a global dataset of glacier ice thickness modeled with IceBoost v2.0, a machine learning model trained on 7 million ice thickness measurements and informed by physical and geometrical predictors. We model the distributed ice thickness for every glacier in the two latest Randolph Glacier Inventory releases (v6.0 and v7.0), totaling 215,547 and 274,531 glacier outlines, respectively, plus 955 ice masses contiguous with the Greenland Ice Sheet. We find a global glacier volume of $(149 \pm 38)\times 10^3$ km$^3$, consistent with the previous ensemble estimate of $(147 \pm 28)\times 10^3$ km$^3$. The corresponding sea-level equivalent, $323 \pm 91$ mm, is likewise consistent with the earlier value of $315 \pm 63$ mm. Compared to measurements, IceBoost error is 20-45% lower than the other solutions in the high Arctic, highlighting the value of machine-learning approaches. Confidence in our solution is highest at higher latitudes. Over mountainous terrain, small glaciers, and under-represented lower-latitude regions, confidence is lower. IceBoost v2.0 demonstrates strong generalization at ice sheet margins. On the Geikie Plateau (East Greenland), we find nearly twice as much ice as previously reported, highlighting the method's potential to infer bed topography in parts of the ice sheets. The quality of the solutions depends on the accuracy of the training data, the Digital Elevation Model, ice velocity fields, and glacier geometries, including nunataks. Using the Jensen Gap, we probe the model's curvature with respect to input errors and find it is strongly concave over low-slope, thick-ice regions, implying a potential downward bias in predicted thickness under input uncertainty. The released dataset can be used to model future glacier evolution and sea-level rise, inform the design of glaciological surveys and field campaigns, as well as guide policies on freshwater management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mathematical complexity and high dimensionality of neural networks slow both training and deployment, demanding heavy computational resources. This has driven the search for alternative architectures built from novel components, including new activation functions. Taking a different approach from state-of-the-art neural and neuromorphic computational systems, we employ the current-voltage characteristic of a tunnel diode as a quantum physics-based activation function for deep networks. This tunnel-diode activation function (TDAF) outperforms standard activations in deep architectures, delivering lower loss and higher accuracy in both training and evaluation. We also highlight its promise for implementation in electronic hardware aimed at neuromorphic, ternarised and energy efficient AI systems. Speaking broadly, our work lays a solid foundation for a new bridge between machine learning, semiconductor electronics and quantum physics -- bringing together quantum tunnelling, a phenomenon recognised in six Nobel Prizes (including the 2025 award), and contemporary AI research.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering from aminoacetonitrile: effects of polarisation-correlation and basis-set on cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aminoacetonitrile occupies a prime importance in the interface between astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry. Its detection in the ISM establishes it as part of the organic inventory of star-forming regions, while its role as a glycine precursor highlights its significance for origins-of-life scenarios. In this work, electron scattering from aminoacetonitrile has been studied using the $R$-matrix method in the low-energy range from $\sim$0 to 10 eV. The calculations were carried out within the $C_{s}$ point group using static-exchange (SE), static-exchange plus polarisation (SEP), and configuration interaction (CI) models, with two basis sets (6-311G* and cc-pVTZ) to understand their dependence on cross section. Various scattering observables, such as differential elastic cross section, integral elastic, excitation, and momentum transfer cross sections, were examined. Since aminoacetonitrile is a prebiotically relevant molecule, these findings provide valuable insight into electron-driven processes in complex organic systems and form a theoretical foundation for future work on electron-induced reactivity in prebiotic and astrophysical environments.</description>

Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>ASPEN: An Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network for Ginzburg-Landau Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03290</link>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.</description>
