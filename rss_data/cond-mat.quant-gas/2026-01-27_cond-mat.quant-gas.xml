      <title>Quasicrystalline Analogue of the Haldane Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for a topological quasicrystalline system which is suitable for realisation in cold-atom experiments. We define the model in terms of complex momentum-space couplings which break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), and detail how it may be experimentally realised using two-photon Raman couplings. In the weak-potential limit, we study the model analytically by calculating the bandstructure over a `quasi-Brillouin zone' (QBZ). We find symmetry-protected Dirac cones, which are gapped by a TRS-breaking term, resulting in a Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. This provides a direct analogy to the Haldane model, but now in a quasicrystalline setting. We also infer the number of states below the topological gap from the QBZ area. We verify our analysis with numerical calculations of periodic approximants to our system, constructing a phase diagram in parameter space which shows a topological region extending beyond the weak-potential regime. We also find examples of narrow Chern bands with the potential for hosting strongly-correlated physics. Our work raises questions about the nature of localisation and strongly-correlated states in Chern bands in quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of bosonic Thouless pump due to interaction in a quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of inter-particle interaction on the quantized Thouless pump in the bosonic quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr{\'e} model and find that the quantization of the pumped charge breaks down already for weak interactions. Furthermore, the pumped charge undergoes sharp changes as a function of interaction strength that we can attribute to the closing of specific doublon channels. As expected, the quantization revives in the hard-core limit at very large interaction strengths where the bosons are subject to a hardcore constraint. Interestingly, the stability of isolated doublons under the pump depends on the band they are in. For repulsive interactions and a suitably fixed pump period, doublons in the lowest band are pumped stably while doublons in higher bands dissociate during the pump with one particle decaying into a lower band. This asymmetry leads to the decay of the total energy over time, in stark contrast to the typical Floquet heating expected for a driven many-body system.</description>

      <title>Formation Dynamics of Quantum Droplets for Homonuclear and Heteronuclear Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Great effort has been invested over the past decade in studying the properties of quantum droplets, a phase of bosonic quantum matter that arises as a consequence of the fluctuating Lee-Huang-Yang correction. However, the dynamics of droplet formation for heteronuclear Bose mixtures is partially understood. Here, we numerically analyze the formation process for homonuclear and heteronuclear boson mixtures in one dimension using a tight-binding model and real-time evolution. A systematic sweep of interaction strengths, mass ratios, and initial conditions allows us to characterize quantitative criteria for droplet formation and equilibration. We find that the energy contribution of the LHY correction dominates the energetic profile of the droplets formed, with the deepest binding occurring for mass ratios $m_2/m_1 \in [1.2,2.0]$. Breathing oscillations are observed, and the low equilibration rate is consistent with the restricted nature of the phase space for one-dimensional systems; the oscillation frequency is found to have a very weak correlation to the interaction strengths. For the simulation, Gaussian over discrete initial conditions are clearly favorable to the formation of droplets. The results contained herein provide rich insight into the dynamical nature of quantum droplet physics.</description>

      <title>Supersolid phases and collective excitations in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled spin-1 condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collective excitation spectrum and dynamics of a quasi two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba type spin-orbit (SO) coupling. Employing Bogoliubov-de-Gennes analysis, we analytically compute the excitation spectra across a wide range of interaction strengths and coupling parameters. By systematically varying the SO and Rabi couplings, we uncover distinct dynamical signatures of quantum phase transitions, including mode softening, the appearance of roton-like minima, and miscibility-driven instabilities in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction regimes. In the antiferromagnetic case, these instabilities lead to a dynamically unstable supersolid phase characterized by the coexistence of density modulation and global phase coherence. To corroborate the analytical predictions, we numerically solve the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations and analyze the dynamical stability of the condensate. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for spinor condensates with tunable spin-orbit coupling and demonstrate the rich interplay between spin-dependent interactions and synthetic couplings in nonequilibrium quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>A general variational approach for equilibrium phase boundaries of trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple and general variational method to estimate the solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations and obtain the corresponding density profiles for all spin states of a trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We further employ this approach to obtain the complete phase diagram of the system under quasi-one-dimensional harmonic confinement, with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin interactions. We identify a suitable scaling that collapses all phase diagrams for different system sizes (i.e., total particle number) into a universal (system size-independent) phase diagram. The complete phase diagram for a confined system shows some significant qualitative differences compared to that of a condensate with homogeneous density distribution. The phase diagrams reported here could help identify the important parameter regimes in which phase transitions in the confined system, in general, occur. This knowledge of the region of phase boundaries can enable a reliable investigation of the instabilities near the boundaries that drive phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A single atom vibration sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously in vibration sensors, optical glass plates, optical fibres, carbon nanotubes, semiconductor materials, piezoelectric materials and molecules are proved to be effective transducers for sensing vibrations. In this work, for the first time, we will propose a model of vibration sensor using single atom transport in an open optical lattice. In this apparatus, information of mechanical vibration could be transferred into shaking of optical lattice through one of a cavity mirror. Shaking lattice consequently induces Mott insulator due to quantum interference. It is found that information of vibration is encoded in the atomic current and it could be extracted by Fourier transformations. The present atomic vibration sensor has wide detection range of frequency with high precision. Our present model of sensor based on atomic system opens a new area of studying vibration sensors.</description>

      <title>Influence of intraspecies interactions on the diversity of the wetting phase diagram in dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of intraspecies interactions on the structure and diversity of the wetting phase diagram in a dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates. Within the GP formalism, we employ the double-parabola approximation to describe the interfacial properties of the system in the limit of strong segregation between two of the components. Our analysis focuses on the static behavior near degenerate points where distinct phase boundaries intersect in the parameter space defined by the healing-length ratios. We demonstrate that the first-order and critical wetting transition lines, along with the nucleation line intersect at a unique degenerate point. This finding contrasts with previous studies in the interspecies interaction space, where two degenerate points were observed. These results provide new insights into the interfacial phase behavior of multicomponent quantum gases and offer theoretical guidance for experimental explorations of wetting phenomena in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in open quantum systems independent of system Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in one-dimensional quantum open systems governed by the Lindblad equation with linear dissipation operators, which ensure the density matrix retains its Gaussian form throughout the dynamics. By employing the modular Hamiltonian framework, we rigorously demonstrate that the $\rm{Z}_2$ topological invariant characterizing steady states in one-dimensional class D systems is exclusively dependent on the dissipation operators, rather than the system Hamiltonian. Through a sudden quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both analytically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>The 2D Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system reduced to 1D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mean-field model for a system of 2D abelian anyons, given by the dynamics of a Schr{\"o}dinger matter field coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. We derive an effective 1D equation by adding a strongly anisotropic trapping potential (wave-guide) acting on the Schr{\"o}dinger field, and tracing out the tight confinement direction. The effective dynamics in the loose direction of the wave-guide turns out to be governed by the classical 1D quintic NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full system, the RLE coincides with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

Abstract: A Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is given for the case of a complex phase space weight, which applies generally in quantum statistical mechanics. Computer simulations using Lennard-Jones $^4$He near the $\lambda$-transition, including an expansion to third order of the Wigner-Kirkwood commutation function, give a saturation liquid density in agreement with measured values.</description>
