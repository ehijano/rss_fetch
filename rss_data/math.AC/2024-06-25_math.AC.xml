      <title>On the non-commuting graph associated to a finite-dimensional Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the non-commuting graph associated to a Lie algebra L and obtain some basic graph properties such as connectivity, diameter, girth, Hamiltonian and Eulerian. Moreover, planarity, outer planarity and isomorphism between two such graphs are also discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>The strong Lefschetz property of certain modules over Clements-Lindstr\"om rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for studying the Lefschetz properties for $k[x,y]$-modules based on the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot Lemma. In particular, we prove that certain modules over Artinian Clements-Lindstr\"om rings in characteristic zero have the strong Lefschetz property. In particular, we show that every homogeneous idea in a Clements-Lindstr\"om ring of embedding dimension two has the strong Lefschetz property. As an application, we study the strong Lefschetz property of type two monomial ideals of codimension three.</description>

      <title>Reduced type of certain numerical semigroup rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a reduced one-dimensional complete local $k$-algebra $R$, Huneke et al. (Res. Math. Sci., 8(4), paper no. 60, 2021) introduced an important invariant, the reduced type. In this article, we study the extremal behavior of reduced type of some special numerical semigroup rings. For a numerical semigroup ring, the behavior of reduced type can be studied by analyzing the set of pseudo-Frobenius elements of the numerical semigroup. We give complete descriptions of pseudo-Frobenius elements of Bresinsky's numerical semigroups and duplication of numerical semigroups. Further, we explore the extremal behavior of reduced type for the associated semigroup rings.</description>

      <title>From a local ring to its associated graded algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ be a complete local ring, and $G={\rm gr}_{\mathfrak{m}}(R)$ be its associated graded ring. We introduce a homogenization technique which allows to relate $G$ to the special fiber and $R$ to the generic fiber of a "Gr\"obner-like" deformation. Using this technique we prove sharp results concerning the connectedness of $R$ and $G$. We also construct a family of local domains which fail to satisfy Abhyankar's inequality for the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity. However, we prove a version of the inequality which holds when $R$ is connected in codimension one.</description>

      <title>Factor-critical graphs and dstab, astab for an edge ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, connected non bipartite graph and let $I_G$ be the edge idealof $G$. In our previous work we showed that L. Lov\'asz's theorem on ear decompositions offactor-critical graphs and the canonical decomposition of a graph given by Edmonds and Gallai are basic tools for the irreducible decomposition of $I^{k}_G$. In this paper we use some tools from graph theory, mainly Withney's theorem on ear decompositions of 2-edge connected graphs in order to introduce a new method to make a graph factor-critical. We can describe the set $\cup_ {k=1}^{\infty}{\rm Ass} (I^{k}_G)$ in terms of some subsets of $G$. We give explicit formulas for the numbers astab$(I_G)$ and dstab$(I_G)$, which are, respectively, the smallest number $k$ such that ${\rm Ass} (I^{k}_G)= {\rm Ass} (I^{k+i}_G)$ for all $i\geq 0$ and the smallest number $k$ such that the maximal ideal belongs to ${\rm Ass}(I^{k}_G)$. We also give very simple upper bounds for astab$(I_G)$ and dstab$(I_G)$.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates equivalence of square multivariate polynomial matrices with the determinant being some power of a univariate irreducible polynomial. We first generalized a global-local theorem of Vaserstein. Then we proved these matrices are equivalent to their Smith forms by the generalized global-local theorem.</description>

      <title>It is not "B\'ezout's identity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ there exist integers $m$ and $n$ for which $am-bn =(a,b)$. An increasing number of mathematicians have been calling this `B\'ezout's identity', some encouraged by finding "identit\'e de B\'ezout" in Bourbaki's \emph{'El\'ements de math\'ematique}. Moreover the observation that if $\gcd(a,b)=1$ then this is an `if and only if' condition, is sometimes called the "Bachet-B\'ezout theorem".
  However this is all in Euclid's work from around 300 B.C., when his writings are interpreted in context. So why does he not get credit? Some authors learned the name "B\'ezout's identity" and have perhaps not consulted Euclid, so copied the misattribution. Others, like some Nicolas Bourbaki collaborators, have perhaps browsed Euclid's results, but in a form written for the modern mathematician, and missed out on what he really did (though certainly others, such as Weil, did not). In this article we will carefully explain what Euclid's arguments are and what his approach was. We will also share Kowalski's guess as to the reasons behind Bourbaki's misnomer.
  To appreciate Euclid, you need to read his work in context: Lengths are the central object of study to the geometer Euclid, though he brilliantly developed the theory of the numbers that measured those lengths. Today's mathematicians read his number theory results as being about abstract numbers not measurements. However the correct interpretation changes how these results are perceived; Euclid's proofs make clear Euclid's intentions.
  These misperceptions reflect recent discussions about difficulties faced by indigenous people when learning mathematics. We discuss how some indigenous groups may learn numbers in certain practical contexts, not as abstract entities, and struggle when curricula assume that we all share abstract numbers as a basic, primary fully-absorbed working tool.</description>

      <title>Smooth Surfaces with Maximal Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a smooth projective surface of degree $d$ in $\mathbb P^3$ contains at most $d^2(d^3-3d+3)$ lines. We characterize the surfaces containing exactly $d^2(d^3-3d+3)$: these occur only in prime characterize $p$ and, up to choice of projective coordinates, are cut out by equations of the form $x^{p^{e}+1}+y^{p^{e}+1}+z^{p^{e}+1}+ w^{p^{e}+1} = 0. $</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the standard comparison used by mathematicians between the idempotent complete pretriangulated dg-categories, over a unitary and commutative ring $k$, and the idempotent complete $k$-linear stable $\infty$-categories. Our approach is completely included in the $\infty$-categorical theory. To achieve the target we will reinterpret the Morita theory for dg-categories and we set the Morita theory for $k$-linear stable $\infty$-category.</description>

      <title>Canonical form of matrix factorizations from Fukaya category of surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns homological mirror symmetry for the pair-of-pants surface (A-side) and the non-isolated surface singularity $xyz=0$ (B-side). Burban-Drozd classified indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules on the B-side. We prove that higher-multiplicity band-type modules correspond to higher-rank local systems over closed geodesics on the A-side, generalizing our previous work for the multiplicity one case. This provides a geometric interpretation of the representation tameness of the band-type maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, as every indecomposable object is realized as a geometric object.
  We also present an explicit canonical form of matrix factorizations of $xyz$ corresponding to Burban-Drozd's canonical form of band-type maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules. As applications, we give a geometric interpretation of algebraic operations such as AR translation and duality of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules as well as certain mapping cone operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Bbbk$ be a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, $V$ a finite-dimensional $\Bbbk$-vector-space, and $G$ a finite $p$-group acting $\Bbbk$-linearly on $V$. Let $S = \Sym V^*$. We show that $S^G$ is a polynomial ring if and only if the dimension of its singular locus is less than $\rank_\Bbbk V^G$. Confirming a conjecture of Shank-Wehlau-Broer, we show that if $S^G$ is a direct summand of $S$, then $S^G$ is a polynomial ring, in the following cases: \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\Bbbk = \bbF_p$ and $\rank_\Bbbk V^G = 4$; or
  \item $|G| = p^3$. \end{enumerate} In order to prove the above result, we also show that if $\rank_\Bbbk V^G \geq \rank_\Bbbk V - 2$, then the Hilbert ideal $\hilbertIdeal_{G,S}$ is a complete intersection.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner bases for bipartite determinantal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nakajima's graded quiver varieties naturally appear in the study of bases of cluster algebras. One particular family of these varieties, namely the bipartite determinantal varieties, can be defined for any bipartite quiver and gives a vast generalization of classical determinantal varieties with broad applications to algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and statistics. The ideals that define bipartite determinantal varieties are called bipartite determinantal ideals.
  We provide an elementary method of proof showing that the natural generators of a bipartite determinantal ideal form a Gr\"obner basis, using an S-polynomial construction method that relies on the Leibniz formula for determinants. This method is developed from an idea by Narasimhan and Caniglia--Guccione--Guccione.
  As applications, we study the connection between double determinantal ideals (which are bipartite determinantal ideals of a quiver with two vertices) and tensors, and provide an interpretation of these ideals within the context of algebraic statistics.</description>

      <title>Minimal free resolutions of numerical semigroup algebras via Ap\'ery specialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical semigroups with multiplicity $m$ are parameterized by integer points in a polyhedral cone $C_m$, according to Kunz. For the toric ideal of any such semigroup, the main result here constructs a free resolution whose overall structure is identical for all semigroups parametrized by the relative interior of a fixed face of $C_m$. The matrix entries of this resolution are monomials whose exponents are parametrized by the coordinates of the corresponding point in $C_m$, and minimality of the resolution is achieved when the semigroup is maximal embedding dimension, which is the case parametrized by the interior of $C_m$ itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $R$. In this note, we study the localization of $S$-injective modules and $u$-$S$-injective modules under $S$-Noetherian rings and $u$-$S$-Noetherian rings, respectively. The $u$-$S$-absolutely pure property is showed to be preserved under localizations over $S$-coherent rings. Besides, we give an example to show the difference between $S$-injective modules and $u$-$S$-injective modules, and some counter-examples to deny some questions proposed in \cite{B24}.</description>

      <title>Examples of \'etale extensions of Green functors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new examples of \'etale extensions of Green functors by transferring classical examples of \'etale extensions to the equivariant setting. Our examples are Tambara functors, and we prove Green \'etaleness for them, which implies Tambara \'etaleness. We show that every $C_2$-Galois extensions of fields gives rise to an \'etale extension of $C_2$-Green functors. Here we associate the constant Tambara functor to the base field and the fix-Tambara functor to the extension. We also prove that all $C_n$-Kummer extensions give rise to \'etale extensions for arbitrary finite $n$. \'Etale extensions of fields induce \'etale extension of $G$-Green functors for any finite group $G$ by passing to the corresponding constant $G$-Tambara functors.</description>
