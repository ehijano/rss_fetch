      <title>Kodaira-Spencer maps for elliptic orbispheres as isomorphisms of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a mirror pair of a symplectic manifold $X$ and a Landau-Ginzburg potential $W$, we are interested in the problem whether the quantum cohomology of $X$ and the Jacobian algebra of $W$ are isomorphic. Since those can be equipped with Frobenius algebra structures, we might ask whether they are isomorphic as Frobenius algebras. We show that the Kodaira-Spencer map gives a Frobenius algebra isomorphism for elliptic orbispheres, under the Floer theoretic modification of the residue pairing.</description>

      <title>Quantum cohomology and Fukaya summands from monotone Lagrangian tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a monotone Lagrangian torus inside a compact symplectic manifold $X$, with superpotential $W_L$. We show that a geometrically-defined closed-open map induces a decomposition of the quantum cohomology $\operatorname{QH}^*(X)$ into a product, where one factor is the localisation of the Jacobian ring $\operatorname{Jac} W_L$ at the set of isolated critical points of $W_L$. The proof involves describing the summands of the Fukaya category corresponding to this factor -- verifying the expectations of mirror symmetry -- and establishing an automatic generation criterion in the style of Ganatra and Sanda, which may be of independent interest. We apply our results to understanding the structure of quantum cohomology and to constraining the possible superpotentials of monotone tori</description>

      <title>Outer symplectic billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A submanifold of the standard symplectic space determines a partially defined, multi-valued symplectic map, the outer symplectic billiard correspondence. Two points are in this correspondence if the midpoint of the segment connecting them is on the submanifold, and this segment is symplectically orthogonal to the tangent space of the submanifold at its midpoint. This is a far-reaching generalization of the outer billiard map in the plane; the particular cases, when the submanifold is a closed convex hypersurface or a Lagrangian submanifold, were considered earlier.
  Using a variational approach, we establish the existence of odd-periodic orbits of the outer symplectic billiard correspondence. On the other hand, we give examples of curves in 4-space which do not admit 4-periodic orbits at all. If the submanifold satisfies 49 pages, certain conditions (which are always satisfied if its dimension is at least half of the ambient dimension) we prove the existence of two $n$-reflection orbits connecting two transverse affine Lagrangian subspaces for every $n\geq1$. In addition, for every immersed closed submanifold, the number of single outer symplectic billiard ``shots" from one affine Lagrangian subspace to another is no less than the number of critical points of a smooth function on this submanifold.
  We study, in detail, the behavior of this correspondence when the submanifold is a curve or a Lagrangian submanifold. For Lagrangian submanifolds in 4-dimensional space we present a criterion for the outer symplectic billiard correspondence to be an actual map. We show, in every dimension, that if a Lagrangian submanifold has a cubic generating function, then the outer symplectic billiard correspondence is completely integrable in the Liouville sense.</description>

      <title>Toric mirror monodromies and Lagrangian spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central fiber of a Gross-Siebert type toric degeneration is known to satisfy homological mirror symmetry: its category of coherent sheaves is equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya category of a certain exact symplectic manifold. Here we show that, in the Calabi-Yau case, the images of line bundles are represented by Lagrangian spheres.</description>

      <title>Floer homology and right-veering monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the knot Floer complex of a fibered knot detects whether the monodromy of its fibration is right-veering. In particular, this leads to a purely knot Floer-theoretic characterization of tight contact structures, by the work of Honda, Kazez, and Matic. Our proof makes use of the relationship between the Heegaard Floer homology of mapping tori and the symplectic Floer homology of area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms. We describe applications of this work to Dehn surgeries and taut foliations.</description>

      <title>Spherical objects in dimensions two and three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper classifies spherical objects in various geometric settings in dimensions two and three, including both minimal and partial crepant resolutions of Kleinian singularities, as well as arbitrary flopping 3-fold contractions with only Gorenstein terminal singularities. The main result is much more general: in each such setting, we prove that all objects in the associated null category with no negative Ext groups are the image, under the action of an appropriate braid or pure braid group, of some object in the heart of a bounded t-structure. The corollary is that all objects which admit no negative Exts, and for which the self-Hom space is one dimensional, are the images of the simples. A variation on this argument goes further, and classifies all bounded t-structures. There are multiple geometric, topological and algebraic consequences, primarily to autoequivalences and stability conditions. Our main new technique also extends into representation theory, and we establish that in the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which is silting discrete, every object with no negative Ext groups lies in the heart of a bounded t-structure. As a consequence, every semibrick complex can be completed to a simple minded collection.</description>
