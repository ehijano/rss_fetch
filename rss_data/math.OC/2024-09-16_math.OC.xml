      <title>Beyond Price-Taker: Multiscale Optimization of Wind and Battery Integrated Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonizing global energy systems requires extensive integration of renewable energy into the electric grid. However, the intermittency and variable nature of wind and other non-dispatchable renewable resources make integration a great challenge. Hybridizing renewables with energy storage to form integrated energy systems (IESs) helps mitigate these concerns by improving reliability and resiliency. This paper systematically studies the limitations of the prevailing price-taker assumption for techno-economic analysis (TEA) and optimization of hybrid energy systems. As an illustrative case study, we retrofit an existing wind farm in the RTS-GMLC test system (which loosely mimics the Southwest U.S.) with battery energy storage to form an IES. We show that the standard price-taker model overestimates the electricity revenue and the net present value (NPV) of the IES up to 178% and 50%, respectively, compared to our more rigorous multiscale optimization. These differences arise because introducing storage creates a more flexible resource that impacts the larger wholesale electricity market. Moreover, this work highlights the impact of the IES has on the market via various strategic bidding, and underscores the importance of moving beyond price-taker for optimal storage sizing and TEA of IESs. We conclude by discussing opportunities to generalize the proposed framework to other IESs, and highlight emerging research questions regarding the complex interactions between IESs and markets.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Feasibility in Differentially Private Linearly Constrained Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex programming with linear constraints plays an important role in the operation of a number of everyday systems. However, absent any additional protections, revealing or acting on the solutions to such problems may reveal information about their constraints, which can be sensitive. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a method for solving convex programs while keeping linear constraints private. First, we prove that this method is differentially private and always generates a feasible optimization problem (i.e., one whose solution exists). Then we show that the solution to the privatized problem also satisfies the original, non-private constraints. Next, we bound the expected loss in performance from privacy, which is measured by comparing the cost with privacy to that without privacy. Simulation results apply this framework to constrained policy synthesis in a Markov decision process, and they show that a typical privacy implementation induces only an approximately $9\%$ loss in solution quality.</description>

      <title>A Successive Refinement Algorithm for Tri-Level Stochastic Defender-Attacker Problems with Decision-Dependent Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tri-level defender-attacker game models are a well-studied method for determining how best to protect a system (e.g., a transportation network) from attacks. Existing models assume that defender and attacker actions have a perfect effect, i.e., system components hardened by a defender cannot be destroyed by the attacker, and attacked components always fail. Because of these assumptions, these models produce solutions in which defended components are never attacked, a result that may not be realistic in some contexts. This paper considers an imperfect defender-attacker problem in which defender decisions (e.g., hardening) and attacker decisions (e.g., interdiction) have an imperfect effect such that the probability distribution of a component's capacity depends on the amount of defense and attack resource allocated to the component. Thus, this problem is a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent probabilities and is challenging to solve because the deterministic equivalent formulation has many high-degree multilinear terms. To address the challenges in solving this problem, we propose a successive refinement algorithm that dynamically refines the support of the random variables as needed, leveraging the fact that a less-refined support has fewer scenarios and multilinear terms and is, therefore, easier to solve. A comparison of the successive refinement algorithm versus the deterministic equivalent formulation on a tri-level stochastic maximum flow problem indicates that the proposed method solves many more problem instances and is up to $66$ times faster. These results indicate that it is now possible to solve tri-level problems with imperfect hardening and attacks.</description>

      <title>A Successive Refinement for Solving Stochastic Programs with Decision-Dependent Random Capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of two-stage stochastic programs in which the second stage includes a set of components with uncertain capacity, and the expression for the distribution function of the uncertain capacity includes first-stage variables. Thus, this class of problems has the characteristics of a stochastic program with decision-dependent uncertainty. A natural way to formulate this class of problems is to enumerate the scenarios and express the probability of each scenario as a product of the first-stage decision variables; unfortunately, this formulation results in an intractable model with a large number of variable products with high-degree. After identifying structural results related to upper and lower bounds and how to improve these bounds, we present a successive refinement algorithm that successively and dynamically tightens these bounds. Implementing the algorithm within a branch-and-cut method, we report the results of computational experiments that indicate that the successive refinement algorithm significantly outperforms a benchmark approach. Specifically, results show that the algorithm finds an optimal solution before the refined state space become too large.</description>

      <title>Fitted Q-Iteration via Max-Plus-Linear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</description>

      <title>Towards safe and tractable Gaussian process-based MPC: Efficient sampling within a sequential quadratic programming framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning uncertain dynamics models using Gaussian process~(GP) regression has been demonstrated to enable high-performance and safety-aware control strategies for challenging real-world applications. Yet, for computational tractability, most approaches for Gaussian process-based model predictive control (GP-MPC) are based on approximations of the reachable set that are either overly conservative or impede the controller's safety guarantees. To address these challenges, we propose a robust GP-MPC formulation that guarantees constraint satisfaction with high probability. For its tractable implementation, we propose a sampling-based GP-MPC approach that iteratively generates consistent dynamics samples from the GP within a sequential quadratic programming framework. We highlight the improved reachable set approximation compared to existing methods, as well as real-time feasible computation times, using two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Optimizing electric vehicles charging through smart energy allocation and cost-saving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global focus on combating environmental pollution intensifies, the transition to sustainable energy sources, particularly in the form of electric vehicles (EVs), has become paramount. This paper addresses the pressing need for Smart Charging for EVs by developing a comprehensive mathematical model aimed at optimizing charging station management. The model aims to efficiently allocate the power from charging sockets to EVs, prioritizing cost minimization and avoiding energy waste. Computational simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the mathematical optimization model, which can unleash its full potential when the number of EVs at the charging station is high.</description>

      <title>Curves of Minimax Spirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding curves of minimum pointwise-maximum arc-length derivative of curvature, here simply called curves of minimax spirality, among planar curves of fixed length with prescribed endpoints and tangents at the endpoints. We consider the case when simple bounds (constraints) are also imposed on the curvature along the curve. The curvature at the endpoints may or may not be specified. We prove via optimal control theory that the optimal curve is some concatenation of Euler spiral arcs, circular arcs, and straight line segments. When the curvature is not constrained (or when the curvature constraint does not become active), an optimal curve is only made up of a concatenation of Euler spiral arcs, unless the oriented endpoints lie in a line segment or a circular arc of the prescribed length, in which case the whole curve is either a straight line segment or a circular arc segment, respectively. We propose numerical methods and illustrate these methods and the results by means of three example problems of finding such curves.</description>

      <title>Exactness Conditions for Semidefinite Relaxations of the Quadratic Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is an important discrete optimization instance that encompasses many well-known combinatorial optimization problems, and has applications in a wide range of areas such as logistics and computer vision. The QAP, unfortunately, is NP-hard to solve. To address this difficulty, a number of semidefinite relaxations of the QAP have been developed. These techniques are known to be powerful in that they compute globally optimal solutions in many instances, and are often deployed as sub-routines within enumerative procedures for solving QAPs. In this paper, we investigate the strength of these semidefinite relaxations. Our main result is a deterministic set of conditions on the input matrices -- specified via linear inequalities -- under which these semidefinite relaxations are exact. Our result is simple to state, in the hope that it serves as a foundation for subsequent studies on semidefinite relaxations of the QAP as well as other related combinatorial optimization problems. As a corollary, we show that the semidefinite relaxation is exact under a perturbation model whereby the input matrices differ by a suitably small perturbation term. One technical difficulty we encounter is that the set of dual feasible solutions is not closed. To circumvent these difficulties, our analysis constructs a sequence of dual feasible solutions whose objective value approaches the primal objective, but never attains it.</description>

      <title>The Line-Based Dial-a-Ride Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-demand ridepooling systems offer flexible services pooling multiple passengers into one vehicle, complementing traditional bus services. We propose a transportation system combining the spatial aspects of a fixed sequence of bus stops with the temporal flexibility of ridepooling. In the line-based Dial-a-Ride problem (liDARP), vehicles adhere to a fixed, ordered sequence of stops in their routes, with the possibility of taking shortcuts and turning if they are empty. We propose three MILP formulations for the liDARP with a multi-objective function balancing environmental aspects with customer satisfaction, comparing them on a real-world bus line. Our experiments show that the formulation based on an Event-Based graph is the fastest, solving instances with up to 50 requests in under one second. Compared to the classical DARP, the liDARP is computationally faster, with minimal increases in total distance driven and average ride times.</description>

      <title>A Near-Optimal Algorithm for Convex Simple Bilevel Optimization under Weak Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization provides a comprehensive framework that bridges single- and multi-objective optimization, encompassing various formulations, including standard nonlinear programs. This paper focuses on a specific class of bilevel optimization known as simple bilevel optimization. In these problems, the objective is to minimize a composite convex function over the optimal solution set of another composite convex minimization problem. By reformulating the simple bilevel problem as finding the left-most root of a nonlinear equation, we employ a bisection scheme to efficiently obtain a solution that is $\epsilon$-optimal for both the upper- and lower-level objectives. In each iteration, the bisection narrows down an interval by assessing the feasibility of a discriminating criterion. By introducing a novel dual approach and employing the Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method, we demonstrate that each subproblem in the bisection scheme can be solved in ${\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(L_{g_1}+2D_z L_{f_1}+1)/\epsilon}|\log\epsilon|^2)$ oracle queries under weak assumptions. Here, $L_{f_1}$ and $L_{g_1}$ represent the Lipschitz constants of the gradients of the upper- and lower-level objectives' smooth components, and $D_z$ is the upper bound of the optimal multiplier of the subproblem. Considering the number of binary searches, the total complexity of our proposed method is ${\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(L_{g_1}+2D_z L_{f_1}+1)/\epsilon}|\log\epsilon|^3)$. Our method achieves near-optimal complexity results, comparable to those in unconstrained smooth or composite convex optimization when disregarding the logarithmic terms. Numerical experiments also demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Resilient Infrastructure Network: Sparse Edge Change Identification via L1-Regularized Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial actions and a rapid climate change are disrupting operations of infrastructure networks (e.g., energy, water, and transportation systems). Unaddressed disruptions lead to system-wide shutdowns, emphasizing the need for quick and robust identification methods. One significant disruption arises from edge changes (addition or deletion) in networks. We present an $\ell_1$-norm regularized least-squares framework to identify multiple but sparse edge changes using noisy data. We focus only on networks that obey equilibrium equations, as commonly observed in the above sectors. The presence or lack of edges in these networks is captured by the sparsity pattern of the weighted, symmetric Laplacian matrix, while noisy data are node injections and potentials. Our proposed framework systematically leverages the inherent structure within the Laplacian matrix, effectively avoiding overparameterization. We demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach through a series of representative examples, with a primary emphasis on power networks.</description>

      <title>End-to-end metasurface design for temperature imaging via broadband Planck-radiation regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for temperature imaging from long-wavelength infrared thermal radiation (e.g. 8-12 $\mu$m) through the end-to-end design of a metasurface-optics frontend and a computational-reconstruction backend. We introduce a new nonlinear reconstruction algorithm, ``Planck regression," that reconstructs the temperature map from a grayscale sensor image, even in the presence of severe chromatic aberration, by exploiting blackbody and optical physics particular to thermal imaging. We combine this algorithm with an end-to-end approach that optimizes a manufacturable, single-layer metasurface to yield the most accurate reconstruction. Our designs demonstrate high-quality, noise-robust reconstructions of arbitrary temperature maps (including completely random images) in simulations of an ultra-compact thermal-imaging device. We also show that Planck regression is much more generalizable to arbitrary images than a straightforward neural-network reconstruction, which requires a large training set of domain-specific images.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Nonlinear Path-following Guidance with Bounded Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tracking of arbitrary curvilinear geometric paths in three-dimensional output spaces of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without pre-specified timing requirements, commonly referred to as path-following problems, subjected to bounded inputs. Specifically, we propose a novel nonlinear path-following guidance law for a UAV that enables it to follow any smooth curvilinear path in three dimensions while accounting for the bounded control authority in the design. The proposed solution offers a general treatment of the path-following problem by removing the dependency on the path's geometry, which makes it applicable to paths with varying levels of complexity and smooth curvatures. Additionally, the proposed strategy draws inspiration from the pursuit guidance approach, which is known for its simplicity and ease of implementation. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the UAV converges to its desired path within a fixed time and remains on it irrespective of its initial configuration with respect to the path. Finally, the simulations demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of the proposed guidance strategy through a wide range of engagement scenarios, showcasing the UAV's ability to follow diverse curvilinear paths accurately.</description>

      <title>Optimal Operation of a Building with Electricity-Heat Networks and Seasonal Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As seasonal thermal energy storage emerges as an efficient solution to reduce CO2 emissions of buildings, challenges appear related to its optimal operation. In a system including short-term electricity storage, long-term heat storage, and where electricity and heat networks are connected through a heat pump, it becomes crucial to operate the system on two time scales. Based on real data from a university building, we simulate the operation of such a system over a year, comparing different strategies based on model predictive control (MPC). The first objective of this paper is to determine the minimum prediction horizon to retrieve the results of the full-horizon operation problem with cost minimization. The second objective is to evaluate a method that combines MPC with setting targets on the heat storage level at the end of the prediction horizon, based on historical data. For a prediction horizon of 6 days, the suboptimality gap with the full-horizon results is 4.31%, compared to 11.42% when using a prediction horizon of 42 days and fixing the final level to be equal to the initial level, which is a common approach.</description>

      <title>Increasing Both Batch Size and Learning Rate Accelerates Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strongly depends on setting the batch size and learning rate to minimize the empirical loss in training the deep neural network. In this paper, we present theoretical analyses of mini-batch SGD with four schedulers: (i) constant batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (ii) increasing batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (iii) increasing batch size and increasing learning rate scheduler, and (iv) increasing batch size and warm-up decaying learning rate scheduler. We show that mini-batch SGD using scheduler (i) does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss, whereas it does using any of schedulers (ii), (iii), and (iv). Furthermore, schedulers (iii) and (iv) accelerate mini-batch SGD. The paper also provides numerical results of supporting analyses showing that using scheduler (iii) or (iv) minimizes the full gradient norm of the empirical loss faster than using scheduler (i) or (ii).</description>

      <title>In-depth Analysis of Low-rank Matrix Factorisation in a Federated Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a distributed algorithm to compute a low-rank matrix factorization on $N$ clients, each holding a local dataset $\mathbf{S}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i \times d}$, mathematically, we seek to solve $min_{\mathbf{U}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i\times r}, \mathbf{V}\in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r} } \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \|\mathbf{S}^i - \mathbf{U}^i \mathbf{V}^\top\|^2_{\text{F}}$. Considering a power initialization of $\mathbf{V}$, we rewrite the previous smooth non-convex problem into a smooth strongly-convex problem that we solve using a parallel Nesterov gradient descent potentially requiring a single step of communication at the initialization step. For any client $i$ in $\{1, \dots, N\}$, we obtain a global $\mathbf{V}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ common to all clients and a local variable $\mathbf{U}^i$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n_i \times r}$. We provide a linear rate of convergence of the excess loss which depends on $\sigma_{\max} / \sigma_{r}$, where $\sigma_{r}$ is the $r^{\mathrm{th}}$ singular value of the concatenation $\mathbf{S}$ of the matrices $(\mathbf{S}^i)_{i=1}^N$. This result improves the rates of convergence given in the literature, which depend on $\sigma_{\max}^2 / \sigma_{\min}^2$. We provide an upper bound on the Frobenius-norm error of reconstruction under the power initialization strategy. We complete our analysis with experiments on both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Matching: Fine-tuning Flow and Diffusion Generative Models with Memoryless Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there has not been many theoretically-sound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Generalization Guarantees for Weight Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weight normalization (WeightNorm) is widely used in practice for the training of deep neural networks and modern deep learning libraries have built-in implementations of it. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical characterizations of both optimization and generalization of deep WeightNorm models with smooth activation functions. For optimization, from the form of the Hessian of the loss, we note that a small Hessian of the predictor leads to a tractable analysis. Thus, we bound the spectral norm of the Hessian of WeightNorm networks and show its dependence on the network width and weight normalization terms--the latter being unique to networks without WeightNorm. Then, we use this bound to establish training convergence guarantees under suitable assumptions for gradient decent. For generalization, we use WeightNorm to get a uniform convergence based generalization bound, which is independent from the width and depends sublinearly on the depth. Finally, we present experimental results which illustrate how the normalization terms and other quantities of theoretical interest relate to the training of WeightNorm networks.</description>

      <title>Online Actuator Selection and Controller Design for Linear Quadratic Regulation with Unknown System Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the simultaneous actuator selection and controller design problem for linear quadratic regulation with Gaussian noise over a finite horizon of length $T$ and unknown system model. We consider both episodic and non-episodic settings of the problem and propose online algorithms that specify both the sets of actuators to be utilized under a cardinality constraint and the controls corresponding to the sets of selected actuators. In the episodic setting, the interaction with the system breaks into $N$ episodes, each of which restarts from a given initial condition and has length $T$. In the non-episodic setting, the interaction goes on continuously. Our online algorithms leverage a multiarmed bandit algorithm to select the sets of actuators and a certainty equivalence approach to design the corresponding controls. We show that our online algorithms yield $\sqrt{N}$-regret for the episodic setting and $T^{2/3}$-regret for the non-episodic setting. We extend our algorithm design and analysis to show scalability with respect to both the total number of candidate actuators and the cardinality constraint. We numerically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate Bounds for the Mirror Descent Method: IQCs, Popov Criterion and Bregman Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive convergence analysis for the mirror descent (MD) method, a widely used algorithm in convex optimization. The key feature of this algorithm is that it provides a generalization of classical gradient-based methods via the use of generalized distance-like functions, which are formulated using the Bregman divergence. Establishing convergence rate bounds for this algorithm is in general a non-trivial problem due to the lack of monotonicity properties in the composite nonlinearities involved. In this paper, we show that the Bregman divergence from the optimal solution, which is commonly used as a Lyapunov function for this algorithm, is a special case of Lyapunov functions that follow when the Popov criterion is applied to an appropriate reformulation of the MD dynamics. This is then used as a basis to construct an integral quadratic constraint (IQC) framework through which convergence rate bounds with reduced conservatism can be deduced. We also illustrate via examples that the convergence rate bounds derived can be tight.</description>

      <title>A Passivity-Based Method for Accelerated Convex Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a constructive methodology for designing accelerated convex optimisation algorithms in continuous-time domain. The two key enablers are the classical concept of passivity in control theory and the time-dependent change of variables that maps the output of the internal dynamic system to the optimisation variables. The Lyapunov function associated with the optimisation dynamics is obtained as a natural consequence of specifying the internal dynamics that drives the state evolution as a passive linear time-invariant system. The passivity-based methodology provides a general framework that has the flexibility to generate convex optimisation algorithms with the guarantee of different convergence rate bounds on the objective function value. The same principle applies to the design of online parameter update algorithms for adaptive control by re-defining the output of internal dynamics to allow for the feedback interconnection with tracking error dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the Newton-MR algorithm for nonconvex unconstrained optimization to the settings where Hessian information is approximated. Under a particular noise model on the Hessian matrix, we investigate the iteration and operation complexities of this variant to achieve appropriate sub-optimality criteria in several nonconvex settings. We do this by first considering functions that satisfy the (generalized) Polyak-\L ojasiewicz condition, a special sub-class of nonconvex functions. We show that, under certain conditions, our algorithm achieves global linear convergence rate. We then consider more general nonconvex settings where the rate to obtain first order sub-optimality is shown to be sub-linear. In all these settings, we show that our algorithm converges regardless of the degree of approximation of the Hessian as well as the accuracy of the solution to the sub-problem. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm with several alternatives on a few machine learning problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to nonsmooth multiobjective optimization through the proposal of a Smoothing Accelerated Proximal Gradient Method with Extrapolation Term (SAPGM). Leveraging the foundation of smoothing methods and the accelerated algorithm for multiobjective optimization by Tanabe et al., our method exhibits a refined convergence rate. Specifically, we establish that the convergence rate of our proposed method can be enhanced from $O(1/k^2)$ to $o(1/k^2)$ by incorporating a distinct extrapolation term \(\frac{k-1}{k + \alpha -1}\) with \(\alpha &gt; 3\).Moreover, we prove that the iterates sequence is convergent to an optimal solution of the problem. Furthermore, we present an effective strategy for solving the subproblem through its dual representation, validating the efficacy of the proposed method through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the minimizers of a degenerate case of the Ohta-Kawasaki energy, defined as the sum of the perimeter and a Coulombic nonlocal term. We start by investigating radially symmetric candidates which give us insights into the asymptotic behaviors of energy minimizers in the large mass limit. In order to numerically study the problems that are analytically challenging, we propose a phase-field reformulation which is shown to Gamma-converge to the original sharp interface model. Our phase-field simulations and asymptotic results suggest that the energy minimizers exhibit behaviors similar to the self-assembly of amphiphiles, including the formation of lipid bilayer membranes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Chen et al. [9], the authors initiated the control-theoretic study of a class of discrete-time multilinear time-invariant (MLTI) control systems, where system states, inputs, and outputs are all tensors endowed with the Einstein product. They established criteria for fundamental system-theoretic notions such as stability, reachability, and observability through tensor decomposition. Building on this new research direction, the purpose of our paper is to extend the study to continuous-time MLTI control systems. Specifically, we define Hamiltonian tensors and symplectic tensors, and we establish the Schur-Hamiltonian tensor decomposition and the symplectic tensor singular value decomposition (SVD). Based on these concepts, we propose the algebraic Riccati tensor equation (ARTE) and demonstrate that it has a unique positive semidefinite solution if the system is stabilizable and detectable. To find numerical solutions to the ARTE, we introduce a tensor-based Newton method. Additionally, we establish the tensor versions of the bounded real lemma and the small gain theorem. A first-order robustness analysis of the ARTE is also conducted. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the proposed theory and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Convergence of AdaGrad with Relaxed Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the convergence of AdaGrad with momentum (covering AdaGrad as a special case) on non-convex smooth optimization problems. We consider a general noise model where the noise magnitude is controlled by the function value gap together with the gradient magnitude. This model encompasses a broad range of noises including bounded noise, sub-Gaussian noise, affine variance noise and the expected smoothness, and it has been shown to be more realistic in many practical applications. Our analysis yields a probabilistic convergence rate which, under the general noise, could reach at (\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})). This rate does not rely on prior knowledge of problem-parameters and could accelerate to (\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T)) where (T) denotes the total number iterations, when the noise parameters related to the function value gap and noise level are sufficiently small. The convergence rate thus matches the lower rate for stochastic first-order methods over non-convex smooth landscape up to logarithm terms [Arjevani et al., 2023]. We further derive a convergence bound for AdaGrad with mometum, considering the generalized smoothness where the local smoothness is controlled by a first-order function of the gradient norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of quickest change detection (QCD) concerns design and analysis of algorithms to estimate in real time the time at which an important event takes place, and identify properties of the post-change behavior. It is shown in this paper that approaches based on reinforcement learning (RL) can be adapted based on any "surrogate information state" that is adapted to the observations. Hence we are left to choose both the surrogate information state process and the algorithm. For the former, it is argued that there are many choices available, based on a rich theory of asymptotic statistics for QCD. Two approaches to RL design are considered: (i) Stochastic gradient descent based on an actor-critic formulation. Theory is largely complete for this approach: the algorithm is unbiased, and will converge to a local minimum. However, it is shown that variance of stochastic gradients can be very large, necessitating the need for commensurately long run times; (ii) Q-learning algorithms based on a version of the projected Bellman equation. It is shown that the algorithm is stable, in the sense of bounded sample paths, and that a solution to the projected Bellman equation exists under mild conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate these findings, and provide a roadmap for algorithm design in more general settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the design of sparse actuator schedules for linear time-invariant systems. An actuator schedule selects, for each time instant, which control inputs act on the system in that instant. We address the optimal scheduling of control inputs under a hard constraint on the number of inputs that can be used at each time. For a sparsely controllable system, we characterize sparse actuator schedules that make the system controllable, and then devise a greedy selection algorithm that guarantees controllability while heuristically providing low control effort. We further show how to enhance our greedy algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based randomized optimization</description>

      <title>Uniform $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity for almost-minimizers of some nonlocal perturbations of the perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity theorem for almost-minimizers of the functional $\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon,\gamma}=P-\gamma P_{\varepsilon}$, where $\gamma\in(0,1)$ and $P_{\varepsilon}$ is a nonlocal energy converging to the perimeter as $\varepsilon$ vanishes. Our theorem provides a criterion for $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity at a point of the boundary which is uniform as the parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to $0$. Since the two terms in the energy are of the same order when $\varepsilon$ is small, we are considering here much stronger nonlocal interactions than those considered in most related works. As a consequence of our regularity result, we obtain that, for $\varepsilon$ small enough, volume-constrained minimizers of $\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon,\gamma}$ are balls. For small $\varepsilon$, this minimization problem corresponds to the large mass regime for a Gamow-type problem where the nonlocal repulsive term is given by an integrable $G$ with sufficiently fast decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Flow Pursuit via Feedback-based Safe Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of controlling inverter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) in a distribution grid to solve an AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem in real time. The AC OPF includes voltage constraints, and seeks to minimize costs associated with the economic operation, power losses, or the power curtailment from renewables. We develop an online feedback optimization method to drive the DERs' power setpoints to solutions of an AC OPF problem based only on voltage measurements (and without requiring measurements of the power consumption of non-controllable assets). The proposed method - grounded on the theory of control barrier functions - is based on a continuous approximation of the projected gradient flow, appropriately modified to accommodate measurements from the power network. We provide results in terms of local exponential stability, and assess the robustness to errors in the measurements and in the system Jacobian matrix. We show that the proposed method ensures anytime satisfaction of the voltage constraints when no model and measurement errors are present; if these errors are present and are small, the voltage violation is practically negligible. We also discuss extensions of the framework to virtual power plant setups and to cases where constraints on power flows and currents must be enforced. Numerical experiments on a 93-bus distribution system and with realistic load and production profiles show a superior performance in terms of voltage regulation relative to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Links between the Fundamental Lemma and Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizations and variations of the fundamental lemma by Willems et al. are an active topic of recent research. In this note, we explore and formalize the links between kernel regression and some known nonlinear extensions of the fundamental lemma. Applying a transformation to the usual linear equation in Hankel matrices, we arrive at an alternative implicit kernel representation of the system trajectories while keeping the requirements on persistency of excitation. We show that this representation is equivalent to the solution of a specific kernel regression problem. We explore the possible structures of the underlying kernel as well as the system classes to which they correspond.</description>

      <title>Robustifying Model-Based Locomotion by Zero-order Stochastic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Guard Saltation Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic/robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to enhance the robustness of model-based legged locomotion against contact uncertainties. We integrate the contact uncertainties into the covariance propagation of stochastic/robust NMPC framework by leveraging the guard saltation matrix and an extended Kalman filter-like covariance update. We achieve fast stochastic/robust NMPC computation by utilizing the zero-order algorithm with additional improvements in computational efficiency concerning the feedback gains. We conducted numerical experiments and demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately forecast future state covariance and generate trajectories that satisfies constraints even in the presence of the contact uncertainties. Hardware experiments on the perceptive locomotion of a wheeled-legged robot were also carried out, validating the feasibility of the proposed method in a real-world system with limited on-board computation.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Transient Bullwhip Effects Under Imperfect Demand Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by how forecast errors exacerbate order fluctuations in supply chains, we leverage robust feedback controller synthesis to characterize, compute, and minimize the worst-case order fluctuation experienced by an individual supply chain vendor. Assuming bounded forecast errors and demand fluctuations, we model forecast error and demand fluctuations as inputs to linear inventory dynamics, and use the $\ell_\infty$ gain to define a transient Bullwhip measure. In contrast to the existing Bullwhip measure, the transient Bullwhip measure explicitly depends on the forecast error. This enables us to separately quantify the transient Bullwhip measure's sensitivity to forecast error and demand fluctuations. To compute the controller that minimizes the worst-case peak gain, we formulate an optimization problem with bilinear matrix inequalities and show that it is equivalent to minimizing a quasi-convex function on a bounded domain. We simulate our model for vendors with non-zero perishable rates and order backlogging rates, and prove that the transient Bullwhip measure can be bounded by a monotonic quasi-convex function whose dependency on the product backlog rate and perishing rate is verified in simulation.</description>
