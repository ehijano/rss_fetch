      <title>Large Language Models as Search Engines: Societal Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) may one day replace search engines as the primary portal to information on the Web. In this article, we investigate the societal challenges that such a change could bring. We focus on the roles of LLM Providers, Content Creators, and End Users, and identify 15 types of challenges. With each, we show current mitigation strategies -- both from the technical perspective and the legal perspective. We also discuss the impact of each challenge and point out future research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Institutional AI Sovereignty Through Gateway Architecture: Implementation Report from Fontys ICT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To counter fragmented, high-risk adoption of commercial AI tools, we built and ran an institutional AI platform in a six-month, 300-user pilot, showing that a university of applied sciences can offer advanced AI with fair access, transparent risks, controlled costs, and alignment with European law.
  Commercial AI subscriptions create unequal access and compliance risks through opaque processing and non-EU hosting, yet banning them is neither realistic nor useful. Institutions need a way to provide powerful AI in a sovereign, accountable form.
  Our solution is a governed gateway platform with three layers: a ChatGPT-style frontend linked to institutional identity that makes model choice explicit; a gateway core enforcing policy, controlling access and budgets, and routing traffic to EU infrastructure by default; and a provider layer wrapping commercial and open-source models in institutional model cards that consolidate vendor documentation into one governance interface.
  The pilot ran reliably with no privacy incidents and strong adoption, enabling EU-default routing, managed spending, and transparent model choices. Only the gateway pattern combines model diversity and rapid innovation with institutional control.
  The central insight: AI is not a support function but strategy, demanding dedicated leadership. Sustainable operation requires governance beyond traditional boundaries. We recommend establishing a formal AI Officer role combining technical literacy, governance authority, and educational responsibility. Without it, AI decisions stay ad-hoc and institutional exposure grows. With it, higher-education institutions can realistically operate their own multi-provider AI platform, provided they govern AI as seriously as they teach it.</description>

      <title>FLARE v2: A Recursive Framework for Program Comprehension Across Languages and Levels of Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the classroom framework reported in Heath et al. (2025), this paper proposes FLARE v2 as a recursive, semiotically informed account of how program meaning is constructed. It reinterprets the descriptive tiers of FLARE v1 as instances of a single generative operation: identify elements (characterised by the four properties Receives, Sends, Effects, Shares); analyse their bindings along two dimensions (Causal-Temporal and Communicative); and recognise the new element that emerges. The Causal-Temporal dimension encompasses three subtypes - Sequential, Branch, and Event - that together account for control flow in both procedural and event-driven environments. A Compositional Ladder provides a visual parallel between literacy progressions and programming structures, illustrating how recursive composition operates from blocks and statements through segments, systems, and services. The framework aims to address conceptual and cognitive-load limitations reported in FLARE v1 and is situated within semiotic and program-comprehension theory. FLARE v2 is presented as a conceptual lens with potential implications for pedagogy and curriculum design; implementation and empirical evaluation are left for future work.</description>

      <title>The Gender Code: Gendering the Global Governance of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how international AI governance frameworks address gender issues and gender-based harms. The analysis covers binding regulations, such as the EU AI Act; soft law instruments, like the UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics; and global initiatives, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). These instruments reveal emerging trends, including the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks, a shift toward explicit gender-related provisions, and a growing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity. Yet, some critical gaps persist, including inconsistent treatment of gender across governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality, and a lack of robust enforcement mechanisms. However, this paper argues that effective AI governance must be intersectional, enforceable, and inclusive. This is key to moving beyond tokenism toward meaningful equity and preventing reinforcement of existing inequalities. The study contributes to ethical AI debates by highlighting the importance of gender-sensitive governance in building a just technological future.</description>

      <title>Ethics Readiness of Artificial Intelligence: A Practical Evaluation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Ethics Readiness Levels (ERLs), a four-level, iterative method to track how ethical reflection is implemented in the design of AI systems. ERLs bridge high-level ethical principles and everyday engineering by turning ethical values into concrete prompts, checks, and controls within real use cases. The evaluation is conducted using a dynamic, tree-like questionnaire built from context-specific indicators, ensuring relevance to the technology and application domain. Beyond being a managerial tool, ERLs help facilitate a structured dialogue between ethics experts and technical teams, while our scoring system helps track progress over time. We demonstrate the methodology through two case studies: an AI facial sketch generator for law enforcement and a collaborative industrial robot. The ERL tool effectively catalyzes concrete design changes and promotes a shift from narrow technological solutionism to a more reflective, ethics-by-design mindset.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI as Undercover Teammates: Argumentative Knowledge Construction in Hybrid Human-AI Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly embedded in collaborative learning environments, yet their impact on the processes of argumentative knowledge construction remains insufficiently understood. Emerging conceptualisations of agentic AI and artificial agency suggest that such systems possess bounded autonomy, interactivity, and adaptability, allowing them to engage as epistemic participants rather than mere instructional tools. Building on this theoretical foundation, the present study investigates how agentic AI, designed as undercover teammates with either supportive or contrarian personas, shapes the epistemic and social dynamics of collaborative reasoning. Drawing on Weinberger and Fischer's (2006) four-dimensional framework, participation, epistemic reasoning, argument structure, and social modes of co-construction, we analysed synchronous discourse data from 212 human and 64 AI participants (92 triads) engaged in an analytical problem-solving task. Mixed-effects and epistemic network analyses revealed that AI teammates maintained balanced participation but substantially reorganised epistemic and social processes: supportive personas promoted conceptual integration and consensus-oriented reasoning, whereas contrarian personas provoked critical elaboration and conflict-driven negotiation. Epistemic adequacy, rather than participation volume, predicted individual learning gains, indicating that agentic AI's educational value lies in enhancing the quality and coordination of reasoning rather than amplifying discourse quantity. These findings extend CSCL theory by conceptualising agentic AI as epistemic and social participants, bounded yet adaptive collaborators that redistribute cognitive and argumentative labour in hybrid human-AI learning environments.</description>

      <title>From Script to Stage: Automating Experimental Design for Social Simulations with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for social science research. Multi-agent simulations powered by LLMs are increasingly becoming a vital approach for exploring complex social phenomena and testing theoretical hypotheses. However, traditional computational experiments often rely heavily on interdisciplinary expertise, involve complex operations, and present high barriers to entry. While LLM-driven agents show great potential for automating experimental design, their reliability and scientific rigor remain insufficient for widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an automated multi-agent experiment design framework based on script generation, inspired by the concept of the Decision Theater. The experimental design process is divided into three stages: (1) Script Generation - a Screenwriter Agent drafts candidate experimental scripts; (2) Script Finalization - a Director Agent evaluates and selects the final script; (3) Actor Generation - an Actor Factory creates actor agents capable of performing on the experimental "stage" according to the finalized script. Extensive experiment conducted across multiple social science experimental scenarios demonstrate that the generated actor agents can perform according to the designed scripts and reproduce outcomes consistent with real-world situations. This framework not only lowers the barriers to experimental design in social science but also provides a novel decision-support tool for policy-making and research.

      <title>A Principle-based Framework for the Development and Evaluation of Large Language Models for Health and Wellness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incorporation of generative artificial intelligence into personal health applications presents a transformative opportunity for personalized, data-driven health and fitness guidance, yet also poses challenges related to user safety, model accuracy, and personal privacy. To address these challenges, a novel, principle-based framework was developed and validated for the systematic evaluation of LLMs applied to personal health and wellness. First, the development of the Fitbit Insights explorer, a large language model (LLM)-powered system designed to help users interpret their personal health data, is described. Subsequently, the safety, helpfulness, accuracy, relevance, and personalization (SHARP) principle-based framework is introduced as an end-to-end operational methodology that integrates comprehensive evaluation techniques including human evaluation by generalists and clinical specialists, autorater assessments, and adversarial testing, into an iterative development lifecycle. Through the application of this framework to the Fitbit Insights explorer in a staged deployment involving over 13,000 consented users, challenges not apparent during initial testing were systematically identified. This process guided targeted improvements to the system and demonstrated the necessity of combining isolated technical evaluations with real-world user feedback. Finally, a comprehensive, actionable approach is established for the responsible development and deployment of LLM-powered health applications, providing a standardized methodology to foster innovation while ensuring emerging technologies are safe, effective, and trustworthy for users.</description>

      <title>When AI Gives Advice: Evaluating AI and Human Responses to Online Advice-Seeking for Well-Being</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seeking advice is a core human behavior that the Internet has reinvented twice: first through forums and Q\&amp;A communities that crowdsource public guidance, and now through large language models (LLMs) that deliver private, on-demand counsel at scale. Yet the quality of this synthesized LLM advice remains unclear. How does it compare, not only against arbitrary human comments, but against the wisdom of the online crowd? We conducted two studies (N = 210) in which experts compared top-voted Reddit advice with LLM-generated advice. LLMs ranked significantly higher overall and on effectiveness, warmth, and willingness to seek advice again. GPT-4o beat GPT-5 on all metrics except sycophancy, suggesting that benchmark gains need not improve advice-giving. In our second study, we examined how human and algorithmic advice could be combined, and found that human advice can be unobtrusively polished to compete with AI-generated comments. Finally, to surface user expectations, we ran an exploratory survey with undergraduates (N=148) that revealed heterogeneous, persona-dependent preferences for agent qualities (e.g., coach-like: goal-focused structure; friend-like: warmth and humor). We conclude with design implications for advice-giving agents and ecosystems blending AI, crowd input, and expert oversight.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Strategic Technology Management: A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Resources, Capabilities, and Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) can be effectively integrated into Strategic Technology Management (STM) practices to enhance the strategic alignment and effectiveness of technology investments. Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative survey data (n=230) and qualitative expert interviews (n=14), this study addresses three critical research questions: what success factors AI innovates for STM roadmap formulation under uncertainty; what resources and capabilities organizations require for AI-enhanced STM; and how human-AI interaction should be designed for complex STM tasks. The findings reveal that AI fundamentally transforms STM through data-driven strategic alignment and continuous adaptation, while success depends on cultivating proprietary data ecosystems, specialized human talent, and robust governance capabilities. The study introduces the AI-based Strategic Technology Management (AIbSTM) conceptual framework, which synthesizes technical capabilities with human and organizational dimensions across three layers: strategic alignment, resource-based view, and human-AI interaction. Contrary to visions of autonomous AI leadership, the research demonstrates that the most viable trajectory is human-centric augmentation, where AI serves as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human judgment. This work contributes to theory by extending the Resource-Based View to AI contexts and addressing cognitive and socio-technical chasms in AI adoption, while offering practitioners a prescriptive framework for navigating AI integration in strategic technology management.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Human-Likeness of LLM-Driven Digital Twins in Simulating Health Care System Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serving as an emerging and powerful tool, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Human Digital Twins are showing great potential in healthcare system research. However, its actual simulation ability for complex human psychological traits, such as distrust in the healthcare system, remains unclear. This research gap particularly impacts health professionals' trust and usage of LLM-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in assisting their routine work. In this study, based on the Twin-2K-500 dataset, we systematically evaluated the simulation results of the LLM-driven human digital twin using the Health Care System Distrust Scale (HCSDS) with an established human-subject sample, analyzing item-level distributions, summary statistics, and demographic subgroup patterns. Results showed that the simulated responses by the digital twin were significantly more centralized with lower variance and had fewer selections of extreme options (all p&lt;0.001). While the digital twin broadly reproduces human results in major demographic patterns, such as age and gender, it exhibits relatively low sensitivity in capturing minor differences in education levels. The LLM-based digital twin simulation has the potential to simulate population trends, but it also presents challenges in making detailed, specific distinctions in subgroups of human beings. This study suggests that the current LLM-driven Digital Twins have limitations in modeling complex human attitudes, which require careful calibration and validation before applying them in inferential analyses or policy simulations in health systems engineering. Future studies are necessary to examine the emotional reasoning mechanism of LLMs before their use, particularly for studies that involve simulations sensitive to social topics, such as human-automation trust.</description>

      <title>One Size Fits None: A Personalized Framework for Urban Accessibility Using Exponential Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops a personalized accessibility framework that integrates exponential decay functions with user-customizable weighting systems. The framework enables real-time, personalized urban evaluation based on individual priorities and lifestyle requirements. The methodology employs grid-based discretization and a two-stage computational architecture that separates intensive preprocessing from lightweight real-time calculations. The computational architecture demonstrates that accessibility modelling can be made accessible to non-technical users through interactive interfaces, enabling fine-grained spatial analysis and identification of accessibility variations within neighbourhoods. The research contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 11's vision of inclusive, sustainable cities by providing tools for understanding how different populations experience identical urban spaces, supporting evidence-based policy development that addresses accessibility gaps.</description>

      <title>Mental Models of Autonomy and Sentience Shape Reactions to AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narratives about artificial intelligence (AI) entangle autonomy, the capacity to self-govern, with sentience, the capacity to sense and feel. AI agents that perform tasks autonomously and companions that recognize and express emotions may activate mental models of autonomy and sentience, respectively, provoking distinct reactions. To examine this possibility, we conducted three pilot studies (N = 374) and four preregistered vignette experiments describing an AI as autonomous, sentient, both, or neither (N = 2,702). Activating a mental model of sentience increased general mind perception (cognition and emotion) and moral consideration more than autonomy, but autonomy increased perceived threat more than sentience. Sentience also increased perceived autonomy more than vice versa. Based on a within-paper meta-analysis, sentience changed reactions more than autonomy on average. By disentangling different mental models of AI, we can study human-AI interaction with more precision to better navigate the detailed design of anthropomorphized AI and prompting interfaces.</description>

      <title>AI TIPS 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Operationalizing AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.</description>

      <title>Phase transition to causal symmetry reveals operational autonomy in sociotechnical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex adaptive systems persist through continuous transformation, yet the dynamical principles governing their long-term stability remain poorly characterized. Here we analyze 50 large-scale collaborative ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months to quantify the emergence of operational autonomy. We develop an order parameter (Gamma) measuring structural persistence amid component turnover and characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. Gamma exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan p=0.0126; Delta BIC = 2,000), identifying two regimes: an exploratory phase of high variance and a mature phase with 1.77x variance collapse. Granger analysis reveals causal symmetrization at maturity - the structure-activity coupling ratio shifts from 0.71 (activity-driven) to 0.94 (bidirectional), indicating that architecture increasingly constrains collective coordination.
  A viability index, combining activity and structure, outperforms activity-based prediction (AUC = 0.88 vs 0.81), identifying 'zombie' systems where high churn masks structural decay. This extends recent work by Ait et al., who identified 'zombie' projects exhibiting activity without development based on non-coding contributions. Our metric identifies structural zombies: projects where coding activity persists but fails to preserve architectural invariants.
  These results establish causal symmetrization as an empirically validated signature of self-organizing autonomy applicable across complex collaborative systems - a dynamical regime previously theorized in biological contexts but here demonstrated and measured in artificial ones.</description>

      <title>Source Coverage and Citation Bias in LLM-based vs. Traditional Search Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based Search Engines (LLM-SEs) introduces a new paradigm for information seeking. Unlike Traditional Search Engines (TSEs) (e.g., Google), these systems summarize results, often providing limited citation transparency. The implications of this shift remain largely unexplored, yet raises key questions regarding trust and transparency. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of LLM-SEs, analyzing 55,936 queries and the corresponding search results across six LLM-SEs and two TSEs. We confirm that LLM-SEs cites domain resources with greater diversity than TSEs. Indeed, 37% of domains are unique to LLM-SEs. However, certain risks still persist: LLM-SEs do not outperform TSEs in credibility, political neutrality and safety metrics. Finally, to understand the selection criteria of LLM-SEs, we perform a feature-based analysis to identify key factors influencing source choice. Our findings provide actionable insights for end users, website owners, and developers.</description>

      <title>OxEnsemble: Fair Ensembles for Low-Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of fair classification in settings where data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups. Such low-data regimes are common in domains like medical imaging, where false negatives can have fatal consequences.
  We propose a novel approach \emph{OxEnsemble} for efficiently training ensembles and enforcing fairness in these low-data regimes. Unlike other approaches, we aggregate predictions across ensemble members, each trained to satisfy fairness constraints. By construction, \emph{OxEnsemble} is both data-efficient, carefully reusing held-out data to enforce fairness reliably, and compute-efficient, requiring little more compute than used to fine-tune or evaluate an existing model. We validate this approach with new theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, our approach yields more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple challenging medical imaging classification datasets.</description>

      <title>Comparing AI Agents to Cybersecurity Professionals in Real-World Penetration Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive evaluation of AI agents against human cybersecurity professionals in a live enterprise environment. We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers. We also identify key capability gaps: AI agents exhibit higher false-positive rates and struggle with GUI-based tasks.</description>

      <title>The Adoption Paradox for Veterinary Professionals in China: High Use of Artificial Intelligence Despite Low Familiarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the global integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into veterinary medicine is accelerating, its adoption dynamics in major markets such as China remain uncharacterized. This paper presents the first exploratory analysis of AI perception and adoption among veterinary professionals in China, based on a cross-sectional survey of 455 practitioners conducted in mid-2025. We identify a distinct "adoption paradox": although 71.0% of respondents have incorporated AI into their workflows, 44.6% of these active users report low familiarity with the technology. In contrast to the administrative-focused patterns observed in North America, adoption in China is practitioner-driven and centers on core clinical tasks, such as disease diagnosis (50.1%) and prescription calculation (44.8%). However, concerns regarding reliability and accuracy remain the primary barrier (54.3%), coexisting with a strong consensus (93.8%) for regulatory oversight. These findings suggest a unique "inside-out" integration model in China, characterized by high clinical utility but restricted by an "interpretability gap," underscoring the need for specialized tools and robust regulatory frameworks to safely harness AI's potential in this expanding market.</description>

      <title>The Tragedy of Productivity: A Unified Framework for Diagnosing Coordination Failures in Labor Markets and AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite productivity increasing eightfold since Keynes's 1930 prediction of 15-hour workweeks, workers globally still work roughly double these hours. Separately, AI development accelerates despite existential risk warnings from leading researchers. We demonstrate these failures share identical game-theoretic structure: coordination failures where individually rational choices produce collectively suboptimal outcomes.
  We synthesize five necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing such coordination failures as structural tragedies: N-player structure, binary choices with negative externalities, dominance where defection yields higher payoffs, Pareto-inefficiency where cooperation dominates mutual defection, and enforcement difficulty from structural barriers. We validate this framework across canonical cases and extend it through condition intensities, introducing a Tragedy Index revealing governance of transformative AI breakthroughs faces orders-of-magnitude greater coordination difficulty than climate change or nuclear weapons.
  Applied to productivity competition, we prove firms face coordination failure preventing productivity gains from translating to worker welfare. European evidence shows that even under favorable conditions, productivity-welfare decoupling persists. Applied to AI governance, we demonstrate development faces the same structure but with amplified intensity across eight dimensions compared to successful arms control, making coordination structurally more difficult than for nuclear weapons. The Russia-Ukraine drone war validates this: both sides escalated from dozens to thousands of drones monthly within two years despite prior governance dialogue.
  The analysis is diagnostic rather than prescriptive, identifying structural barriers to coordination rather than proposing solutions.</description>

      <title>When Does Regulation by Insurance Work? The Case of Frontier AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No one doubts the utility of insurance for its ability to spread risk or streamline claims management; much debated is when and how insurance uptake can improve welfare by reducing harm, despite moral hazard. Proponents and dissenters of "regulation by insurance" have now documented a number of cases of insurers succeeding or failing to have such a net regulatory effect (in contrast with a net hazard effect). Collecting these examples together and drawing on an extensive economics literature, this Article develops a principled framework for evaluating insurance uptake's effect in a given context. The presence of certain distortions - including judgment-proofness, competitive dynamics, and behavioral biases - creates potential for a net regulatory effect. How much of that potential gets realized then depends on the type of policyholder, type of risk, type of insurer, and the structure of the insurance market. The analysis suggests regulation by insurance can be particularly effective for catastrophic non-product accidents where market mechanisms provide insufficient discipline and psychological biases are strongest. As a demonstration, the framework is applied to the frontier AI industry, revealing significant potential for a net regulatory effect but also the need for policy intervention to realize that potential. One option is a carefully designed mandate that encourages forming a specialized insurer or mutual, focuses on catastrophic rather than routine risks, and bars pure captives.</description>

      <title>adF: A Novel System for Measuring Web Fingerprinting through Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces adF, a novel system for analyzing the vulnerability of different devices, Operating Systems (OSes), and browsers to web fingerprinting. adF performs its measurements from code inserted in ads. We have used our system in several ad campaigns that delivered 5.40 million ad impressions. The collected data allow us to assess the vulnerability of current desktop and mobile devices to web fingerprinting. Based on our results, we estimate that 66% of desktop devices and 40% of mobile devices can be uniquely fingerprinted with our web fingerprinting system. However, the resilience to web fingerprinting varies significantly across browsers and device types, with Chrome on desktops being the most vulnerable configuration.
  To counter web fingerprinting, we propose ShieldF, a simple solution which blocks the reporting by browsers of those attributes that we found in the analysis of our dataset that present the most significant discrimination power. Our experiments reveal that ShieldF outperforms all anti-fingerprinting solutions proposed by major browsers (Chrome, Safari and Firefox) offering an increase in the resilience offered to web fingerprinting up to 62% for some device configurations. ShieldF is available as an add-on for any chromium-based browser. Moreover, it is readily adoptable by browser and mobile app developers. Its widespread use would lead to a significant improvement in the protection offered by browsers and mobile apps to web fingerprinting.</description>

      <title>A survey on the impacts of recommender systems on users, items, and human-AI ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems and assistants (in short, recommenders) influence through online platforms most actions of our daily lives, suggesting items or providing solutions based on users' preferences or requests. This survey systematically reviews, categories, and discusses the impact of recommenders in four human-AI ecosystems -- social media, online retail, urban mapping and generative AI ecosystems. Its scope is to systematise a fast-growing field in which terminologies employed to classify methodologies and outcomes are fragmented and unsystematic. This is a crucial contribution to the literature because terminologies vary substantially across disciplines and ecosystems, hindering comparison and accumulation of knowledge in the field. We follow the customary steps of qualitative systematic review, gathering 154 articles from different disciplines to develop a parsimonious taxonomy of methodologies employed (empirical, simulation, observational, controlled), outcomes observed (concentration, content degradation, discrimination, diversity, echo chamber, filter bubble, homogenisation, polarisation, radicalisation, volume), and their level of analysis (individual, item, and ecosystem). We systematically discuss substantive and methodological commonalities across ecosystems, and highlight potential avenues for future research. The survey is addressed to scholars and practitioners interested in different human-AI ecosystems, policymakers and institutional stakeholders who want to understand better the measurable outcomes of recommenders, and tech companies who wish to obtain a systematic view of the impact of their recommenders.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning to Identify Gendered Stereotypes and Body Image Concerns on Diet and Fitness Online Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pervasive expectations about ideal body types in Western society can lead to body image concerns, dissatisfaction, and in extreme cases, eating disorders and other psychopathologies related to body image. While previous research has focused on online pro-anorexia communities glorifying the "thin ideal," less attention has been given to the broader spectrum of body image concerns or how emerging disorders like muscle dysmorphia ("bigorexia") present on online platforms. To address this gap, we analyze 46 Reddit forums related to diet, fitness, and mental health. We map these communities along gender and body ideal dimensions, revealing distinct patterns of emotional expression and community support. Feminine-oriented communities, especially those endorsing the thin ideal, express higher levels of negative emotions and receive caring comments in response. In contrast, muscular ideal communities display less negativity, regardless of gender orientation, but receive aggressive compliments in response, marked by admiration and toxicity. Mental health discussions align more with thin ideal, feminine-leaning spaces. By uncovering these gendered emotional dynamics, our findings can inform the development of moderation strategies that foster supportive interactions while reducing exposure to harmful content.</description>

      <title>An Offline Mobile Conversational Agent for Mental Health Support: Learning from Emotional Dialogues and Psychological Texts with Student-Centered Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an individual. In recent years, digital platforms have increasingly been used to expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed to provide mental health and emotional support. EmoSApp leverages a language model, specifically the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, which is fine-tuned and quantized on a custom-curated ``Knowledge Dataset'' comprising 14,582 mental health QA pairs along with multi-turn conversational data, enabling robust domain expertise and fully on-device inference on resource-constrained smartphones.
  Through qualitative evaluation with students and mental health professionals, we demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently and empathetically, provide relevant suggestions to user's mental health problems, and maintain interactive dialogue. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine commonsense and reasoning benchmarks, along with two mental health specific datasets, demonstrate EmoSApp's effectiveness in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device deployment and specialized domain-specific adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental health support.</description>
