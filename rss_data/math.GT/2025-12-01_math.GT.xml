      <title>Mutual arc presentations and braided open books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every canonically fibered link in $S^3$ is the binding of a braided open book in $S^3$, addressing a question of Montesinos and Morton. We introduce mutual arc presentations as our main technical tool, which we consider to be of independent interest. We prove that any fibered link admitting such a presentation is the binding of a braided open book. Furthermore, new examples of fibered links serving as bindings of braided open books are obtained via connected sum and cabling operations, thereby providing examples of bindings of braided open books that are not canonically fibered.</description>

      <title>Volumes of moduli spaces of bordered Klein surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise Mirzakhani's recursion to volumes of moduli spaces of bordered Klein surfaces, which include non-orientable surfaces. On these moduli spaces, the top form introduced by Norbury diverges as the lengths of 1-sided geodesics approach zero. However, when integrated over Gendulphe's regularised moduli space, on which the systole of 1-sided geodesics is bounded below by $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, it returns a finite value. Using Norbury's extension of the Mirzakhani--McShane identities to non-orientable surfaces, we derive an explicit formula for the volume of the moduli space of one-bordered Klein bottles, as well as a recursion for arbitrary topologies that fully captures the dependence on Gendulphe's regularisation parameter $\epsilon$. We further relate these results to refined topological recursion, showing that, for a fixed refinement parameter, the volumes of moduli spaces of Klein surfaces with Euler characteristic $-1$ are governed by this procedure, and we conjecture the same holds for general topologies.</description>

      <title>Shortest k-Geodesics on Hyperbolic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the lengths of closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces and their topological complexity, measured by the self-intersection number. In particular, we provide explicit upper bounds for the length $s_k(X)$ of a shortest closed geodesic with exactly $k$ self-intersections in terms of the length $L_\textswab{8}(X)$ of a shortest figure eight curve, improving Basmajian's estimate. We analyze the geometry of a shortest figure eight curve and explicitly build families of words in $\pi_1(X)$ whose geodesic representatives realize prescribed self-intersection numbers. As a consequence, we improve existing estimates on the maximal self-intersection number $I_k(X)$ of shortest geodesics with at least $k$ self-intersections, reducing the asymptotic upper bound from 512 to 128. This provides a sharper quantitative connection between the geometry and combinatorial complexity of non-simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many pairs of spatial surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22073v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiple group rack (MGR) is an algebraic system which is used to construct invariants of spatial surfaces, which are compact surfaces embedded in the $3$-sphere $S^{3}$. Seifert surfaces for links are spatial surfaces. In this paper, we present an infinitely many pairs of Seifert surfaces for each link, where each pair satisfies the following condtions: (i) their regular neighborhoods in $S^{3}$ are ambiently isotopic, (ii) their Seifert matrices are unimodularly congruent, and (iii) the two Seifert surfaces are not ambiently isotopic. In order to prove (iii), we distinguish the Seifert surfaces using the above invariants.</description>

      <title>Random covers of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random covers of a closed hyperbolic surface $\Sigma$, subject to the condition that, for $k\geq 2$, the fundamental group is isomorphic to the free group $F_k$. We show that asymptotically they distribute according to a specific probability measure on the moduli space of metric graphs. As we will demonstrate with explicit calculations for $k=2$, this allows us to determine asymptotic values for the expectation of the systole and other geometric invariants of the covers.</description>

      <title>A multi-variable Alexander polynomial for a framed transverse graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a definition of the rotation number for transverse graph diagrams, extending the classical notion of the rotation number for plane curves. Using this, we introduce a normalized multi-variable Alexander polynomial for framed, oriented transverse graphs without sinks or sources, embedded in the 3-sphere $S^3$. We prove that our invariant coincides with the $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1\vert 1))$-Alexander polynomial proposed by Viro.</description>

      <title>On the symplectic geometry of branched hyperbolic surfaces in genus two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct analogues of Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on an open and dense subset of the space of holonomies of branched hyperbolic structures on a closed genus-2 surface. We show that these coordinates satisfy an analogue of Wolpert's magic formula, and thus provide Darboux charts for the Goldman symplectic form. To this end, we revisit the parametrization of hyperbolic structures on a one-holed torus and introduce a simple polygonal model that makes both length and twist parameters transparent. Gluing two such polygons leads to the notion of bow-tie representations of a genus-2 surface group. We prove that bow-tie representations account for most holonomies of branched hyperbolic structures, though not all: for example, Le Fils' pentagon representations form a real codimension-2 family of holonomies lying outside the bow-tie locus.</description>

      <title>Quantum topological Hochschild homology and annular Khovanov spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Hochschild homology is a topological analogue of classical Hochschild homology of algebras and bimodules. Beliakova, Putyra, and Wehrli introduced quantum Hochschild homology (qHH) and used it to define a quantization of annular Khovanov homology as qHH of the tangle bimodules of Chen-Khovanov and Stroppel. After introducing quantum topological Hochschild homology (qTHH), we construct a new stable homotopy refinement of quantum annular Khovanov homology and show that it agrees with qTHH of the spectral Chen-Khovanov tangle bimodules of Lawson, Lipshitz, and Sarkar. We also show that this new stable homotopy refinement recovers the construction introduced in earlier work of Krushkal together with the first and third authors.</description>

Abstract: Given two symmetric convex bodies $L \subseteq K \subseteq \R^n$ with $L$ strictly convex, we prove that there exist at least $n$ hyperplanes $H$ tangent to $L$, such that the center of mass of $H \cap K$ belongs to $\partial L$.
  The theorem makes use of Lusternik-Schnirelmann category theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized J-groups, J-braid groups and Seifert link groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of J-groups was introduced by Achar and Aubert with the goal of providing Coxeter-like combinatorial tools for studying rank 2 complex reflection groups. However, J-groups lack an explicit presentation with abstract reflections as generators. This gap was filled by Gobet, and later by the second author, for the subfamily of so-called J-reflection groups. The obtained presentations then gave rise to a concept of J-braid group, which coincides with the link groups of torus necklaces.
  In this paper we study a generalization of J-groups. We determine which of these groups are finitely generated. We show that, as for classical J-groups, the family of finite generalized J-groups coincides with the family of rank 2 complex reflection groups. We also show that finitely generated generalized J-groups coincide with what we call the torsion quotients of J-braid groups. We deduce explicit presentations for all finitely generated generalized J-groups, where the generators are abstract reflections. We also complete the classification of these groups up to reflection isomorphism.
  As a byproduct of these results, we obtain that a quotient of a Seifert link group obtained by adding torsion to meridians somehow determines the link up to isotopy. Moreover, such a quotient is finite if and only if it is isomorphic to a complex reflection group of rank two.</description>

      <title>The spherical growth series of amalgamated free products of infinite cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an integer greater than $1$. We consider a group presented as $G(p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n)=\langle x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n \mid x_1^{p_1} =x_2^{p_2}=\cdots =x_n^{p_n} \rangle$, with integers $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ satisfying $2 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_n$. This group is an amalgamated free product of infinite cyclic groups and is geometrically realized as the fundamental group of a Seifert fiber space over the 2-dimensional disk with $n$ cone points whose associated cone angles are $\frac{2\pi}{p_1},\frac{2\pi}{p_2},\dots,\frac{2\pi}{p_n}$. In this paper, we present a formula for the spherical growth series of the group $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ with respect to the generating set $\{x_1,\dots,x_n,x_1^{-1},\dots,x_n^{-1}\}$. We show that from this formula, a rational function expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ can be derived in concrete form for given $p_1,\dots,p_n$. In fact, we wrote an elementary computer program based on this formula that yields an explicit form of a single rational fraction expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$. We present such expressions for several tuples $(p_1,\dots,p_n)$. In 1999, C. P. Gill obtained a similar formula for the same group in the case $n=2$ and showed that there exists a rational function expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ for $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22999v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a classification of the total spaces of $S^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^2$ up to orientation-preserving homotopy equivalence. Our approach proceeds in two steps: we first derive the PL-homeomorphism classification for these manifolds by computing their Kreck-Stolz invariants. Then, building upon this PL classification result and through an application of surgery theory, we establish the homotopy equivalence classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how singularities behave under small perturbations is a central theme in singularity theory. In this paper we establish sufficient conditions for families of analytic function-germs on a germ of a complex analytic space to admit an embedded topological trivialization. Our results extend previous work of the third author and collaborators, moving from abstract triviality to the embedded setting. As an application, we obtain new instances of topological stability, including a broad class of $\mu$-constant deformations. These findings provide a new insight into the long-standing $\mu$-constant conjecture, one of the major open problems in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15577v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a knot to be half ribbon if it is the cross-section of a ribbon 2-knot, and observe that ribbon implies half ribbon implies slice. We introduce the half ribbon genus of a knot K, the minimum genus of a ribbon knotted surface of which K is a cross-section. We compute this genus for all prime knots up to 12 crossings, and many 13-crossing knots. The same approach yields new computations of the doubly slice genus. We also introduce the half fusion number of a knot K, that measures the complexity of ribbon 2-knots of which K is a cross-section. We show that it is bounded from below by the Levine-Tristram signatures, and differs from the standard fusion number by an arbitrarily large amount.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historically originated as a sub-field of topology, knot theory is an active area of mathematical investigation that has strong connections with a diverse set of scientific fields such as algebra, biology, and statistical mechanics. A popular and important concept in linear algebra, Gram determinants enjoy a connection with the mathematical theory of knots. In this article, we expose this concept and present several types of Gram determinants in what can be considered as a survey of the current Gram determinants of interest to knot theorists; examples are included to illustrate the definitions. In particular, we pay special attention to a recently defined determinant from a M\"obius band and we further study its structure. At the end, some speculation is presented regarding the closed formula for the Gram determinant of type $(Mb)_1$, a problem that arouses serious interest among knot theorists.</description>

      <title>Torus knots, the A-polynomial, and SL(2,C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The A-polynomial of a knot is defined in terms of SL(2,C) representations of the knot group, and encodes information about essential surfaces in the knot complement. In 2005, Dunfield-Garoufalidis and Boyer-Zhang proved that it detects the unknot using Kronheimer-Mrowka's work on the Property P conjecture. Here we use more recent results from instanton Floer homology to prove that a version of the A-polynomial detects whether a knot is a torus knot. We moreover completely determine which individual torus knots are detected by this A-polynomial. These results enable progress towards a folklore conjecture about boundary slopes of non-torus knots. Finally, we use similar ideas to prove that a knot in the 3-sphere admits infinitely many SL(2,C)-abelian Dehn surgeries if and only if it is a torus knot, affirming a variant of a conjecture due to Sivek-Zentner.</description>

Continuing the work of Conant in 2016, which identified the 1-loop part of the Johnson cokernel as the Enomoto-Satoh obstruction, we study the 2-loop part. Using the corresponding 2-loop trace map, we capture all the components of the Johnson cokernels in degree 6 that cannot be detected by the Enomoto-Satoh trace.</description>

      <title>On the existence of universal links in three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the only closed $3$-manifolds that admit a universal link are spherical. Also, we prove the non-existence of branched covers between closed aspherical $3$-manifolds. Moreover, we show infinitely many examples of complement universal links that are not universal.</description>

      <title>On the long-time limit of the mean curvature flow in closed manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we show that generally almost regular flows, introduced by Bamler and Kleiner, in closed 3-manifolds will either go extinct in finite time or flow to a collection of smooth embedded minimal surfaces, possibly with multiplicity. Using a perturbative argument then we construct piecewise almost regular flows which either go extinct in finite time or flow to a stable minimal surface, possibly with multiplicity. We apply these results to construct minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds in a variety of circumstances, mainly novel from the point of the view that the arguments are via parabolic methods.</description>

      <title>Surface Observables, $2$-Knot Invariants, and Nonabelian Electric Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a surface observable for nonabelian four-dimensional $BF$ theory with a cosmological term. The surface observable yields new $2$-knot invariants that may extend beyond known examples such as the Alexander invariant. By BV pushforward, the surface observable induces an electric observable in nonabelian Yang-Mills theory, offering a concrete realization of 't~Hooft operators. An application to self-dual Yang-Mills theory is also discussed.</description>
