      <title>Solving and learning advective multiscale Darcian dynamics with the Neural Basis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-governed models are increasingly paired with machine learning for accelerated predictions, yet most "physics--informed" formulations treat the governing equations as a penalty loss whose scale and meaning are set by heuristic balancing. This blurs operator structure, thereby confounding solution approximation error with governing-equation enforcement error and making the solving and learning progress hard to interpret and control. Here we introduce the Neural Basis Method, a projection-based formulation that couples a predefined, physics-conforming neural basis space with an operator-induced residual metric to obtain a well-conditioned deterministic minimization. Stability and reliability then hinge on this metric: the residual is not merely an optimization objective but a computable certificate tied to approximation and enforcement, remaining stable under basis enrichment and yielding reduced coordinates that are learnable across parametric instances. We use advective multiscale Darcian dynamics as a concrete demonstration of this broader point. Our method produce accurate and robust solutions in single solves and enable fast and effective parametric inference with operator learning.</description>

      <title>Variational optimization approach for reconstruction of dielectric permittivity and conductivity functions using partial boundary measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variational optimization approach for the solution of a coefficient inverse problem of simultaneous reconstruction of the dielectric permittivity and conductivity functions in time-dependent Maxwell's system using limited boundary observations of the electric field.
  The variational optimization approach is based on constructing a weak form of a Lagrangian which allows to use finite element based reconstruction algorithms.
  The optimality conditions for the Lagrangian and stability estimate for the adjoint problem are derived, as well as Frech\'et differentiability of it and of the regularized Tikhonov functional are also presented. Two- and three-dimensional numerical studies confirm our theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>A finite-difference summation-by-parts, conditionally stable partitioned algorithm for conjugate heat transfer problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we design and analyze a novel, provably conditionally stable, weakly coupled partitioned scheme to solve the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) problem. We consider a model CHT problem consisting of linear advection-diffusion and heat equations, coupled at an interface through continuity of temperature and heat flux. We employ high-order summation-by-parts finite-difference operators in conjunction with simultaneous-approximation-terms (SATs) in curvilinear coordinates for spatial derivatives, combined with first- and second-order time discretizations and temporal extrapolation at the interface. Energy stability is maintained by carefully selecting SAT parameters at the interface. A range of coupling parameters are explored to identify those that yield a stable scheme, and a stepwise approach for choosing SAT parameters that ensure stability is given. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments in a two-dimensional model problem on a rectangular domain with curvilinear grids. The proposed approach enables the development of high-order, conditionally stable partitioned solvers suitable for general geometries.</description>

      <title>Hybrid ABBA-GMRES for Unmatched Backprojectors in Large Scale X-Ray Computerized Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large-scale X-ray computed tomography (CT), matrix-free iterative methods are essential due to the prohibitive cost of explicitly forming the system matrix. In practice, forward projectors and backprojectors are often implemented with different discretizations or accelerations, leading to unmatched projector pairs. This mismatch violates the adjointness assumptions underlying classical least-squares solvers, so the resulting iterations no longer correspond to a true least-squares problem and can exhibit non-symmetric or inconsistent behavior. Prior work has explored Krylov subspace solvers such as AB-GMRES and BA-GMRES to handle unmatched projector pairs, where these methods exhibit semi-convergent regularizing behavior. Under matched conditions, AB-GMRES and BA-GMRES reduce to LSQR and LSMR, respectively. However, in the presence of unmatched projectors, AB- and BA-GMRES have been observed to yield improved reconstruction quality compared to classical least-squares solvers. In this paper, we develop hybrid AB- and BA-GMRES methods that incorporate Tikhonov regularization directly into the Krylov subspace iterations. We also examine the relationship between the proposed methods and hybrid variants of LSQR and LSMR, considering both matched and unmatched backprojectors. We propose automatic strategies for selecting regularization parameters, including approaches based on the L-curve and generalized cross validation (GCV), and analyze their effect on convergence behavior and image quality. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional CT problems using GPU-accelerated projectors demonstrate that the proposed hybrid AB- and BA-GMRES methods mitigate semi-convergence, produce higher-quality reconstructions, and exhibit more stable stopping behavior than their non-hybrid counterparts.</description>

      <title>Optimal error estimate of an isoparametric upwind discontinuous Galerkin method for radiation transport equation on curved domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the isoparametric upwind discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the radiation transport equation defined on a bounded domain $D$ with a piecewise $C^{k+1}$ smooth curved boundary. An auxiliary mapping is constructed to approximate the original curved domain. The analysis delineates a high-order optimal convergence rate under the DG norm, which comprehensively balances the errors stemming from the numerical discretization and the geometric approximation. Two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and numerical study on the ground states of rotating spin-orbit coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study mathematically and numerically the ground states of three-component rotating spin-orbit coupled (SOC) spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates modeled by the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (CGPEs). Firstly, we rigorously prove existence result of the ground state and derive some analytical properties, including the virial identity and negativity of SOC energy. Secondly, we propose an efficient and accurate preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm to compute the ground states. We truncate the whole space into a bounded rectangular domain and readily apply the Fourier spectral method to approximate the wave function. The PCG method is successfully adapted with appropriate modifications to the adaptive step size control strategy for the one-parameter energy minimization problem and to the choice of preconditioners, achieving great performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Lastly, we carry out extensive numerical experiments to verify the existence and property results of the ground states, confirm the spatial spectral accuracy by traversing the most commonly-used initial guesses for each component thanks to its great efficiency, which is also attributed to a utilization of cascadic multigrid and discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Moreover, we investigate the effects of local interaction, rotation and spin-orbit coupling and external trapping potential on the ground state, and unveil some interesting physical phenomena, such as giant vortex and U-shape vortex line.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of finite element schemes for the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of magnetisation in a bounded ferromagnet in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2$) at high temperatures can be described by the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (sLLB) equation, which is a vector-valued quasilinear stochastic partial differential equation. In this paper, assuming adequate regularity of the initial data, we establish strong convergence in $L^2(\Omega)$ of several semi-implicit and implicit fully discrete finite element schemes for the sLLB equation, together with explicit convergence rates. The analysis relies on localised error estimates and new exponential moment bounds for the exact solution. As a by-product, these moment bounds yield mean-square exponential stability of solutions and uniqueness of the invariant measure in one spatial dimension under a small noise assumption. We also sharpen existing convergence-in-probability results for the numerical schemes. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Computing accurate singular values using a mixed-precision one-sided Jacobi algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a relative forward error analysis of a mixed-precision preconditioned one-sided Jacobi algorithm, analogous to a two-sided version introduced in [N. J. Higham, F. Tisseur, M. Webb and Z. Zhou, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 46 (2025), pp. 2423-2448], which uses low precision to compute the preconditioner, applies it in high precision, and computes the singular value decomposition using the one-sided Jacobi algorithm at working precision. Our analysis yields smaller relative forward error bounds for the computed singular values than those of standard SVD algorithms. We present and analyse two approaches for constructing effective preconditioners. Our numerical experiments support the theoretical results and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves smaller relative forward errors than the LAPACK routines $\texttt{DGESVJ}$ and $\texttt{DGEJSV}$, as well as the MATLAB function $\texttt{svd}$, particularly for ill-conditioned matrices. Timing tests show that our approach accelerates the convergence of the Jacobi iterations and that the dominant cost arises from a single high-precision matrix-matrix multiplication. With improved software or hardware support for this bottleneck, our algorithm would be faster than the LAPACK one-sided Jacobi algorithm $\texttt{DGESVJ}$ and comparable in speed to the state-of-the-art preconditioned one-sided Jacobi algorithm $\texttt{DGEJSV}$, but much more accurate.</description>

      <title>Theoretical insights on the residual transformation from bi-conjugate gradient into bi-conjugate residual via a smoothing scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-conjugate gradient (Bi-CG) and bi-conjugate residual (Bi-CR) methods are underlying iterative solvers for linear systems with nonsymmetric matrices. Residual smoothing is a standard technique for obtaining smooth convergence behavior of residual norms; additionally, it represents the transformation between iterative methods. For example, the residuals of the CR method can be obtained by applying a smoothing scheme to those of the CG method for symmetric linear systems. Based on this relationship, the transformation from Bi-CG residuals to Bi-CR residuals using a smoothing scheme was examined in our previous study [Kawase, A., Aihara, K.: Transformation from Bi-CG into Bi-CR Using a Residual Smoothing-like Scheme. AIP Conference Proceedings (2026)]; however, we only provided heuristic and experimental observations. In the present study, we provide a detailed discussion on the theoretical aspects of these transformations. Specifically, we prove that the resulting algorithm transformed from the Bi-CG method using the residual smoothing technique has the same bi-orthogonal properties as those of the original Bi-CR method. We also present a more concise transformation algorithm and its numerical example. These analyses complement our previous study and provide theoretical validity of the residual transformation between the Bi-CG and Bi-CR methods.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Finite Element Approach for an Anisotropic Multi-Phase Mullins-Sekerka Problem with Kinetic Undercooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sharp interface formulation for an anisotropic multi-phase Mullins-Sekerka problem with kinetic undercooling. The flow is characterized by a cluster of surfaces evolving such that the total surface energy plus a weighted sum of the volumes of the enclosed phases decreases in time. Upon deriving a suitable variational formulation, we introduce a fully discrete unfitted finite element method. In this approach, the approximations of the moving interfaces are independent of the triangulations used for the equations in the bulk. Our method can be shown to be unconditionally stable. Several numerical examples demonstrate the capabilities of the introduced method. In particular, it is demonstrated that the evolution of multiple ice crystals with junctions can be modeled using the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-fractional parabolic equations with a Caputo time derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ are discretised in time using collocation methods, which assume that the Caputo derivative of the computed solution is piecewise-polynomial. For such discretisations of any order $m\ge 0$, with any choice of collocation points, we give sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of collocation solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability and performance of such schemes in the context of the a-posteriori error estimation and adaptive time stepping algorithms.</description>

      <title>Impact of Structure-Preserving Discretizations on Compressible Wall-Bounded Turbulence of Thermally Perfect Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulent channel flow at supersonic and hypersonic Mach numbers are performed using a thermally perfect gas model for CO$_2$. The objective is to assess the role of structure-preserving discretizations of the convective terms in high-enthalpy regimes, with particular emphasis on entropy conservation, kinetic-energy preservation, and consistency with the thermodynamic closure.
  The comparative analysis of various formulations examines their impact on robustness, thermodynamic fluctuations, and turbulence statistics across a range of Mach numbers. Differences among formulations are found to originate primarily in the treatment of thermodynamic variables and progressively influence the dynamical fields as compressibility effects intensify. In particular, the coupling between entropy consistency and pressure discretization is shown to affect Reynolds stresses and mean flow properties in high-speed regimes.
  Overall, the results indicate that consistency between the numerical formulation and the thermodynamic model contributes significantly to the reliable simulation of high-enthalpy compressible turbulence. The study systematically assesses entropy-conservative discretizations for thermally perfect gases in wall-bounded flows and examines their impact on thermodynamic-dynamic coupling at high Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>Model Error Embedding with Orthogonal Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational models of complex physical systems often rely on simplifying assumptions which inevitably introduce model error, with consequent predictive errors. Given data on model observables, the estimation of parameterized model-error representations, along with other model parameters, would be ideally done while separating the contributions of each of the two sets of parameters, in order to ensure meaningful stand-alone model predictions. This work builds an embedded model error framework using a weight-space representation of Gaussian processes (GPs) to flexibly capture model-error spatiotemporal correlations and enable inference with GP-embedding in non-linear models. To disambiguate model and model-error/bias parameters, we extend an existing orthogonal GP method to the embedded model-error setting and derive appropriate orthogonality constraints. To address the increased dimensionality introduced by the GP representation, we employ the likelihood-informed subspace method. The construction is demonstrated on linear and non-linear examples, where it effectively corrects model predictions to match data trends. Extrapolation beyond the training data recovers the prior predictive distribution, and the orthogonality constraints lead to meaningful stand-alone model predictions and nearly uncorrelated posteriors between model and model-error parameters.</description>

      <title>Weakly-singular formulation of the Fractional Laplacian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new formulation of the fractional Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^s$ in $n$-dimensional space ($n \ge 1$). The proposed formulation expresses $(-\Delta)^s$ as a composition of the classical Laplace differential operator and a weakly singular integral operator -- which can be used to reduce e.g. the Dirichlet problem for the fractional Laplacian to a weakly singular integral equation involving both volumetric and boundary integral operators. This reformulation is well suited for efficient and accurate numerical implementation. Although a full description of the associated high-order algorithm is deferred to a subsequent contribution, several numerical examples are included in this paper to demonstrate the high accuracy and computational efficiency achieved by the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Recursive Sketched Interpolation: Efficient Hadamard Products of Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hadamard product of two tensors in the tensor-train (TT) format is a fundamental operation across various applications, such as TT-based function multiplication for nonlinear differential equations or convolutions. However, conventional methods for computing this product typically scale as at least $\mathcal{O}(\chi^4)$ with respect to the TT bond dimension (TT-rank) $\chi$, creating a severe computational bottleneck in practice. By combining randomized tensor-train sketching with slice selection via interpolative decomposition, we introduce Recursive Sketched Interpolation (RSI), a ``scale product'' algorithm that computes the Hadamard product of TTs at a computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(\chi^3)$. Benchmarks across various TT scenarios demonstrate that RSI offers superior scalability compared to traditional methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. We generalize RSI to compute more complex operations, including Hadamard products of multiple TTs and other element-wise nonlinear mappings, without increasing the complexity beyond $\mathcal{O}(\chi^3)$.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of different quadrature methods for cut elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadrature of cut elements is crucial for all Finite Element Methods that do not apply boundary-fitted meshes. It should be efficient, accurate, and robust. Various approaches balancing these requirements have been published, with some available as open-source implementations. This work reviews these open-sources codes and the methods used. Furthermore, benchmarking examples are developed for 2D and 3D geometries. Implicit and explicit boundary descriptions are available for all models. The different examples test the efficiency, accuracy, versatility, and robustness of the codes. Special focus is set on the influence of the input parameter, which controls the desired quadrature order, on the actual integration error. A detailed comparison of the discussed codes is carried out. The benchmarking allows a conclusive comparison and presents a valuable tool for future code development. All tests are published in an accompanying open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Neural-HSS: Hierarchical Semi-Separable Neural PDE Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness in solving PDEs, largely due to their ability to enable fast simulations once trained. However, despite the availability of high-performance computing infrastructure, many critical applications remain constrained by the substantial computational costs associated with generating large-scale, high-quality datasets and training models. In this work, inspired by studies on the structure of Green's functions for elliptic PDEs, we introduce Neural-HSS, a parameter-efficient architecture built upon the Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix structure that is provably data-efficient for a broad class of PDEs. We theoretically analyze the proposed architecture, proving that it satisfies exactness properties even in very low-data regimes. We also investigate its connections with other architectural primitives, such as the Fourier neural operator layer and convolutional layers. We experimentally validate the data efficiency of Neural-HSS on the three-dimensional Poisson equation over a grid of two million points, demonstrating its superior ability to learn from data generated by elliptic PDEs in the low-data regime while outperforming baseline methods. Finally, we demonstrate its capability to learn from data arising from a broad class of PDEs in diverse domains, including electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and biology.</description>

      <title>Support Graph Preconditioners for Off-Lattice Cell-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-lattice agent-based models (or cell-based models) of multicellular systems are increasingly used to create in-silico models of in-vitro and in-vivo experimental setups of cells and tissues, such as cancer spheroids, neural crest cell migration, and liver lobules. These applications, which simulate thousands to millions of cells, require robust and efficient numerical methods. At their core, these models necessitate the solution of a large friction-dominated equation of motion, resulting in a sparse, symmetric, and positive definite matrix equation. The conjugate gradient method is employed to solve this problem, but this requires a good preconditioner for optimal performance. In this study, we develop a graph-based preconditioning strategy that can be easily implemented in such agent-based models. Our approach centers on extending support graph preconditioners to block-structured matrices. We prove asymptotic bounds on the condition number of these preconditioned friction matrices. We then benchmark the conjugate gradient method with our support graph preconditioners and compare its performance to other common preconditioning strategies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic trace estimation for parameter-dependent matrices applied to spectral density approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic trace estimation is a well-established tool for approximating the trace of a large symmetric matrix $\boldsymbol{B}$. Several applications involve a matrix that depends continuously on a parameter $t \in [a,b]$, and require trace estimates of $\boldsymbol{B}(t)$ for many values of $t$. This is, for example, the case when approximating the spectral density of a matrix. Approximating the trace separately for each matrix $\boldsymbol{B}(t_1), \dots, \boldsymbol{B}(t_m)$ clearly incurs redundancies and a cost that scales linearly with $m$. To address this issue, we propose and analyze modifications for three stochastic trace estimators, the Girard-Hutchinson, Nystr\"om, and Nystr\"om++ estimators. Our modification uses fixed randomization across different values of $t$, that is, every matrix $\boldsymbol{B}(t_1), \dots, \boldsymbol{B}(t_m)$ is multiplied with the same set of random vectors. When combined with Chebyshev approximation in $t$, the use of such constant random matrices allows one to reuse matrix-vector products across different values of $t$, leading to significant cost reduction. Our analysis shows that the loss of stochastic independence across different $t$ does not lead to deterioration. In particular, we show that $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ random matrix-vector products suffice to ensure an error of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for Nystr\"om++, independent of low-rank properties of $\boldsymbol{B}(t)$. We discuss in detail how the combination of Nystr\"om++ with Chebyshev approximation applies to spectral density estimation and provide an analysis of the resulting method. This improves various aspects of an existing stochastic estimator for spectral density estimation. Several numerical experiments from electronic structure interaction and neural network optimization validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification of tumor growth modeled by a parametric semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the application of a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to a class of semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion partial differential equations used to model tumor growth. Mathematical models of tumor growth are largely phenomenological in nature, capturing infiltration of the tumor into surrounding healthy tissue, proliferation of the existing tumor, and patient response to therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerable inter-patient variability, inherent heterogeneity of the disease, sparse and noisy data collection, and model inadequacy all contribute to significant uncertainty in the model parameters. It is crucial that these uncertainties can be efficiently propagated through the model to compute quantities of interest (QoIs), which in turn may be used to inform clinical decisions. We show that QMC methods can be successful in computing expectations of meaningful QoIs. Well-posedness results are developed for the model and used to show a theoretical error bound for the case of uniform random fields. The theoretical linear error rate, which is superior to that of standard Monte Carlo, is verified numerically. Encouraging computational results are also provided for lognormal random fields, prompting further theoretical development.</description>

      <title>New perturbation bounds for low rank approximation of matrices: Beyond Eckard-Young-Mirsky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with rank $r$ and spectral decomposition $A = \sum _{i=1}^r \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top, $ where $\sigma_i$ are its singular values, ordered decreasingly, and $u_i, v_i$ are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. For a parameter $1 \le p \le r$, $A_p := \sum_{i=1}^p \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading to the commonly used phrase "low-rank approximation". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. This error plays a critical role in estimating the accuracy of the output of any process involving a low-rank approximation of noisy input. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$, exploiting new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$. In many settings, we obtain notable quantitative improvements compared to classical approaches (using the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem or the Davis-Kahan theorem). This leads to a more accurate error estimate and better guarantee in the analysis of many algorithmic tasks.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Level Deep Framework for Deep Solvers of Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, inspired by the multigrid method, we propose a multi-level deep framework for deep solvers. Overall, it divides the entire training process into different levels of training. At each level of training, an adaptive sampling method proposed in this paper is first employed to obtain new training points, so that these points become increasingly concentrated in computational regions corresponding to high-frequency components. Then, the generalization ability of deep neural networks are utilized to update the PDEs for the next level of training based on the results from all previous levels. Rigorous mathematical proofs and detailed numerical experiments are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dynamical low-rank approximation for the semiclassical Schrodinger equation with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation framework for solving the semiclassical Schrodinger equation with uncertainties. The primary numerical challenges arise from the dual nature of the oscillations: the spatial oscillations inherent in the semiclassical limit and the high-frequency oscillations in the random space induced by uncertainties. We extend two robust integrators -- the projector-splitting integrator and the unconventional integrator -- to the semiclassical regime to evolve the solution on a low-rank manifold. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the DLR method is significantly more computationally efficient than the standard stochastic Galerkin method, as it captures the essential quantum dynamics using a much smaller number of basis functions. Our findings reveal that despite the complex oscillatory patterns of the wave function, its evolution remains concentrated in a low-rank subspace for the cases investigated. Specifically, we observe that the DLR method achieves high fidelity with a remarkably small numerical rank, which remains robust even as the semiclassical parameter $\varepsilon$ decreases. Within our problem settings, the results further suggest that the rank growth is primarily driven by the randomness and regularity of the potential. These results provide practical insights into the low-rank structure of uncertain quantum systems and offer an efficient approach for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification in the semiclassical regime.</description>

      <title>OpenGERT: Open Source Automated Geometry Extraction with Geometric and Electromagnetic Sensitivity Analyses for Ray-Tracing Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate RF propagation modeling in urban environments is critical for developing digital spectrum twins and optimizing wireless communication systems. We introduce OpenGERT, an open-source automated Geometry Extraction tool for Ray Tracing, which collects and processes terrain and building data from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Global ML Building Footprints, and USGS elevation data. Using the Blender Python API, it creates detailed urban models for high-fidelity simulations with NVIDIA Sionna RT. We perform sensitivity analyses to examine how variations in building height, position, and electromagnetic material properties affect ray-tracing accuracy. Specifically, we present pairwise dispersion plots of channel statistics (path gain, mean excess delay, delay spread, link outage, and Rician K-factor) and investigate how their sensitivities change with distance from transmitters. We also visualize the variance of these statistics for selected transmitter locations to gain deeper insights. Our study covers Munich and Etoile scenes, each with 10 transmitter locations. For each location, we apply five types of perturbations: material, position, height, height-position, and all combined, with 50 perturbations each. Results show that small changes in permittivity and conductivity minimally affect channel statistics, whereas variations in building height and position significantly alter all statistics, even with noise standard deviations of 1 meter in height and 0.4 meters in position. These findings highlight the importance of precise environmental modeling for accurate propagation predictions, essential for digital spectrum twins and advanced communication networks. The code for geometry extraction and sensitivity analyses is available at github.com/serhatadik/OpenGERT/.</description>

      <title>Projected Subgradient Ascent for Convex Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a convex function over a closed convex set in a real Hilbert space. For linear functions, we show that a single orthogonal projection suffices to obtain an approximate solution. For continuous convex functions over convex sets, we show that projected subgradient ascent converges to a first-order stationary point when using arbitrarily large step sizes. Taking the step sizes to infinity leads to a deterministic variant of the conditional gradient algorithm, and iterated linear optimization as a special case.</description>
