      <title>ROLCH: Regularized Online Learning for Conditional Heteroskedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts, which yields the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized linear distributional models for conditional heteroskedasticity. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the adaptive estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.</description>

      <title>Computational-Statistical Trade-off in Kernel Two-Sample Testing with Random Fourier Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in methods for two-sample testing, among which the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test has emerged as an effective tool for handling complex and high-dimensional data. Despite its success and widespread adoption, the primary limitation of the MMD test has been its quadratic-time complexity, which poses challenges for large-scale analysis. While various approaches have been proposed to expedite the procedure, it has been unclear whether it is possible to attain the same power guarantee as the MMD test at sub-quadratic time cost. To fill this gap, we revisit the approximated MMD test using random Fourier features, and investigate its computational-statistical trade-off. We start by revealing that the approximated MMD test is pointwise consistent in power only when the number of random features approaches infinity. We then consider the uniform power of the test and study the time-power trade-off under the minimax testing framework. Our result shows that, by carefully choosing the number of random features, it is possible to attain the same minimax separation rates as the MMD test within sub-quadratic time. We demonstrate this point under different distributional assumptions such as densities in a Sobolev ball. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Advanced Graph Clustering Methods: A Comprehensive and In-Depth Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph clustering, which aims to divide a graph into several homogeneous groups, is a critical area of study with applications that span various fields such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and image segmentation. This paper explores both traditional and more recent approaches to graph clustering. Firstly, key concepts and definitions in graph theory are introduced. The background section covers essential topics, including graph Laplacians and the integration of Deep Learning in graph analysis. The paper then delves into traditional clustering methods, including Spectral Clustering and the Leiden algorithm. Following this, state-of-the-art clustering techniques that leverage deep learning are examined. A comprehensive comparison of these methods is made through experiments. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical applications of graph clustering and potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Meta-Analysis with Untrusted Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [See paper for full abstract] Meta-analysis is a crucial tool for answering scientific questions. It is usually conducted on a relatively small amount of ``trusted'' data -- ideally from randomized, controlled trials -- which allow causal effects to be reliably estimated with minimal assumptions. We show how to answer causal questions much more precisely by making two changes. First, we incorporate untrusted data drawn from large observational databases, related scientific literature and practical experience -- without sacrificing rigor or introducing strong assumptions. Second, we train richer models capable of handling heterogeneous trials, addressing a long-standing challenge in meta-analysis. Our approach is based on conformal prediction, which fundamentally produces rigorous prediction intervals, but doesn't handle indirect observations: in meta-analysis, we observe only noisy effects due to the limited number of participants in each trial. To handle noise, we develop a simple, efficient version of fully-conformal kernel ridge regression, based on a novel condition called idiocentricity. We introduce noise-correcting terms in the residuals and analyze their interaction with a ``variance shaving'' technique. In multiple experiments on healthcare datasets, our algorithms deliver tighter, sounder intervals than traditional ones. This paper charts a new course for meta-analysis and evidence-based medicine, where heterogeneity and untrusted data are embraced for more nuanced and precise predictions.</description>

      <title>PID Accelerated Temporal Difference Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon tasks, which have a large discount factor, pose a challenge for most conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Algorithms such as Value Iteration and Temporal Difference (TD) learning have a slow convergence rate and become inefficient in these tasks. When the transition distributions are given, PID VI was recently introduced to accelerate the convergence of Value Iteration using ideas from control theory. Inspired by this, we introduce PID TD Learning and PID Q-Learning algorithms for the RL setting in which only samples from the environment are available. We give theoretical analysis of their convergence and acceleration compared to their traditional counterparts. We also introduce a method for adapting PID gains in the presence of noise and empirically verify its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Covariate Assisted Entity Ranking with Sparse Intrinsic Scores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the item ranking problem with associate covariates, focusing on scenarios where the preference scores can not be fully explained by covariates, and the remaining intrinsic scores, are sparse. Specifically, we extend the pioneering Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model by incorporating covariate information and considering sparse individual intrinsic scores. Our work introduces novel model identification conditions and examines the regularized penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) statistical rates. We then construct a debiased estimator for the penalized MLE and analyze its distributional properties. Additionally, we apply our method to the goodness-of-fit test for models with no latent intrinsic scores, namely, the covariates fully explaining the preference scores of individual items. We also offer confidence intervals for ranks. Our numerical studies lend further support to our theoretical findings, demonstrating validation for our proposed method</description>

      <title>Inflationary Flows: Calibrated Bayesian Inference with Diffusion-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond estimating parameters of interest from data, one of the key goals of statistical inference is to properly quantify uncertainty in these estimates. In Bayesian inference, this uncertainty is provided by the posterior distribution, the computation of which typically involves an intractable high-dimensional integral. Among available approximation methods, sampling-based approaches come with strong theoretical guarantees but scale poorly to large problems, while variational approaches scale well but offer few theoretical guarantees. In particular, variational methods are known to produce overconfident estimates of posterior uncertainty and are typically non-identifiable, with many latent variable configurations generating equivalent predictions. Here, we address these challenges by showing how diffusion-based models (DBMs), which have recently produced state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling tasks, can be repurposed for performing calibrated, identifiable Bayesian inference. By exploiting a previously established connection between the stochastic and probability flow ordinary differential equations (pfODEs) underlying DBMs, we derive a class of models, inflationary flows, that uniquely and deterministically map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional Gaussian distribution via ODE integration. This map is both invertible and neighborhood-preserving, with controllable numerical error, with the result that uncertainties in the data are correctly propagated to the latent space. We demonstrate how such maps can be learned via standard DBM training using a novel noise schedule and are effective at both preserving and reducing intrinsic data dimensionality. The result is a class of highly expressive generative models, uniquely defined on a low-dimensional latent space, that afford principled Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference from a non-stationary unknown process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stationary systems are found throughout the world, from climate patterns under the influence of variation in carbon dioxide concentration, to brain dynamics driven by ascending neuromodulation. Accordingly, there is a need for methods to analyze non-stationary processes, and yet most time-series analysis methods that are used in practice, on important problems across science and industry, make the simplifying assumption of stationarity. One important problem in the analysis of non-stationary systems is the problem class that we refer to as Parameter Inference from a Non-stationary Unknown Process (PINUP). Given an observed time series, this involves inferring the parameters that drive non-stationarity of the time series, without requiring knowledge or inference of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Here we review and unify a diverse literature of algorithms for PINUP. We formulate the problem, and categorize the various algorithmic contributions. This synthesis will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and will enable systematic comparisons of different methods. We also demonstrate that the most common systems that existing methods are tested on - notably the non-stationary Lorenz process and logistic map - are surprisingly easy to perform well on using simple statistical features like windowed mean and variance, undermining the practice of using good performance on these systems as evidence of algorithmic performance. We then identify more challenging problems that many existing methods perform poorly on and which can be used to drive methodological advances in the field. Our results unify disjoint scientific contributions to analyzing non-stationary systems and suggest new directions for progress on the PINUP problem and the broader study of non-stationary phenomena.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference via Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new variational inference method, SPH-ParVI, based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), is proposed for sampling partially known densities (e.g. up to a constant) or sampling using gradients. SPH-ParVI simulates the flow of a fluid under external effects driven by the target density; transient or steady state of the fluid approximates the target density. The continuum fluid is modelled as an interacting particle system (IPS) via SPH, where each particle carries smoothed properties, interacts and evolves as per the Navier-Stokes equations. This mesh-free, Lagrangian simulation method offers fast, flexible, scalable and deterministic sampling and inference for a class of probabilistic models such as those encountered in Bayesian inference and generative modelling.</description>

      <title>Learning Distances from Data with Normalizing Flows and Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density-based distances (DBDs) offer an elegant solution to the problem of metric learning. By defining a Riemannian metric which increases with decreasing probability density, shortest paths naturally follow the data manifold and points are clustered according to the modes of the data. We show that existing methods to estimate Fermat distances, a particular choice of DBD, suffer from poor convergence in both low and high dimensions due to i) inaccurate density estimates and ii) reliance on graph-based paths which are increasingly rough in high dimensions. To address these issues, we propose learning the densities using a normalizing flow, a generative model with tractable density estimation, and employing a smooth relaxation method using a score model initialized from a graph-based proposal. Additionally, we introduce a dimension-adapted Fermat distance that exhibits more intuitive behavior when scaled to high dimensions and offers better numerical properties. Our work paves the way for practical use of density-based distances, especially in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>HiPPO-Prophecy: State-Space Models can Provably Learn Dynamical Systems in Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the in-context learning capabilities of State Space Models (SSMs) and presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical explanation of a possible underlying mechanism. We introduce a novel weight construction for SSMs, enabling them to predict the next state of any dynamical system after observing previous states without parameter fine-tuning. This is accomplished by extending the HiPPO framework to demonstrate that continuous SSMs can approximate the derivative of any input signal. Specifically, we find an explicit weight construction for continuous SSMs and provide an asymptotic error bound on the derivative approximation. The discretization of this continuous SSM subsequently yields a discrete SSM that predicts the next state. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our parameterization empirically. This work should be an initial step toward understanding how sequence models based on SSMs learn in context.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Causal Explanation via Neural Causal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) explainers identify the important subgraph that ensures the prediction for a given graph. Until now, almost all GNN explainers are based on association, which is prone to spurious correlations. We propose {\name}, a GNN causal explainer via causal inference. Our explainer is based on the observation that a graph often consists of a causal underlying subgraph. {\name} includes three main steps: 1) It builds causal structure and the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for a graph, which enables the cause-effect calculation among nodes. 2) Directly calculating the cause-effect in real-world graphs is computationally challenging. It is then enlightened by the recent neural causal model (NCM), a special type of SCM that is trainable, and design customized NCMs for GNNs. By training these GNN NCMs, the cause-effect can be easily calculated. 3) It uncovers the subgraph that causally explains the GNN predictions via the optimized GNN-NCMs. Evaluation results on multiple synthetic and real-world graphs validate that {\name} significantly outperforms existing GNN explainers in exact groundtruth explanation identification</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Compressed Sensing (CS) problem, which is the problem of finding the most sparse vector that satisfies a set of linear measurements up to some numerical tolerance. We introduce an $\ell_2$ regularized formulation of CS which we reformulate as a mixed integer second order cone program. We derive a second order cone relaxation of this problem and show that under mild conditions on the regularization parameter, the resulting relaxation is equivalent to the well studied basis pursuit denoising problem. We present a semidefinite relaxation that strengthens the second order cone relaxation and develop a custom branch-and-bound algorithm that leverages our second order cone relaxation to solve small-scale instances of CS to certifiable optimality. When compared against solutions produced by three state of the art benchmark methods on synthetic data, our numerical results show that our approach produces solutions that are on average $6.22\%$ more sparse. When compared only against the experiment-wise best performing benchmark method on synthetic data, our approach produces solutions that are on average $3.10\%$ more sparse. On real world ECG data, for a given $\ell_2$ reconstruction error our approach produces solutions that are on average $9.95\%$ more sparse than benchmark methods ($3.88\%$ more sparse if only compared against the best performing benchmark), while for a given sparsity level our approach produces solutions that have on average $10.77\%$ lower reconstruction error than benchmark methods ($1.42\%$ lower error if only compared against the best performing benchmark). When used as a component of a multi-label classification algorithm, our approach achieves greater classification accuracy than benchmark compressed sensing methods. This improved accuracy comes at the cost of an increase in computation time by several orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Happ and Greven (2018) developed a methodology for principal components analysis of multivariate functional data for data observed on different dimensional domains. Their approach relies on an estimation of univariate functional principal components for each univariate functional feature. In this paper, we present extensive simulations to investigate choosing the number of principal components to retain. We show empirically that the conventional approach of using a percentage of variance explained threshold for each univariate functional feature may be unreliable when aiming to explain an overall percentage of variance in the multivariate functional data, and thus we advise practitioners to be careful when using it.</description>

      <title>Calibrating dimension reduction hyperparameters in the presence of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02946v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of dimension reduction tools is to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. These tools are employed for a variety of reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational costs. However, there is a fundamental issue that is discussed in other modeling problems that is often overlooked in dimension reduction -- overfitting. In the context of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection, cross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but rarely are such precautions taken when applying dimension reduction. Prior applications of the two most popular non-linear dimension reduction methods, t-SNE and UMAP, fail to acknowledge data as a combination of signal and noise when assessing performance. These methods are typically calibrated to capture the entirety of the data, not just the signal. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging noise when calibrating hyperparameters and present a framework that enables users to do so. We use this framework to explore the role hyperparameter calibration plays in overfitting the data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. More specifically, we show previously recommended values for perplexity and n_neighbors are too small and overfit the noise. We also provide a workflow others may use to calibrate hyperparameters in the presence of noise.</description>

Our framework integrates two widely used bandit methods, Upper Confidence Bound and Thompson Sampling, for both standard and combinatorial settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via several experimental studies, employing both XGBoost and random forest, two popular tree ensemble methods. Compared to state-of-the-art methods based on decision trees and neural networks, our methods exhibit superior performance in terms of both regret minimization and computational runtime, when applied to benchmark datasets and the real-world application of navigation over road networks.</description>

      <title>Loss Shaping Constraints for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several applications in time series forecasting require predicting multiple steps ahead. Despite the vast amount of literature in the topic, both classical and recent deep learning based approaches have mostly focused on minimising performance averaged over the predicted window. We observe that this can lead to disparate distributions of errors across forecasting steps, especially for recent transformer architectures trained on popular forecasting benchmarks. That is, optimising performance on average can lead to undesirably large errors at specific time-steps. In this work, we present a Constrained Learning approach for long-term time series forecasting that aims to find the best model in terms of average performance that respects a user-defined upper bound on the loss at each time-step. We call our approach loss shaping constraints because it imposes constraints on the loss at each time step, and leverage recent duality results to show that despite its non-convexity, the resulting problem has a bounded duality gap. We propose a practical Primal-Dual algorithm to tackle it, and demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits competitive average performance in time series forecasting benchmarks, while shaping the distribution of errors across the predicted window.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Class Imbalance and Why Adam Outperforms Gradient Descent on Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adam has been shown to outperform gradient descent on large language models by a larger margin than on other tasks, but it is unclear why. We show that a key factor in this performance gap is the heavy-tailed class imbalance found in language tasks. When trained with gradient descent, the loss of infrequent words decreases more slowly than the loss of frequent ones. This leads to a slow decrease on the average loss as most samples come from infrequent words. On the other hand, Adam and sign-based methods are less sensitive to this problem. To establish that this behavior is caused by class imbalance, we show empirically that it can be reproduced across architectures and data types, on language transformers, vision CNNs, and linear models. On a linear model with cross-entropy loss, we show that class imbalance leads to imbalanced, correlated gradients and Hessians that have been hypothesized to benefit Adam. We also prove that, in continuous time, gradient descent converges slowly on low-frequency classes while sign descent does not.</description>

      <title>OTSeg: Multi-prompt Sinkhorn Attention for Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent success of CLIP has demonstrated promising results in zero-shot semantic segmentation by transferring muiltimodal knowledge to pixel-level classification. However, leveraging pre-trained CLIP knowledge to closely align text embeddings with pixel embeddings still has limitations in existing approaches. To address this issue, we propose OTSeg, a novel multimodal attention mechanism aimed at enhancing the potential of multiple text prompts for matching associated pixel embeddings. We first propose Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn (MPS) based on the Optimal Transport (OT) algorithm, which leads multiple text prompts to selectively focus on various semantic features within image pixels. Moreover, inspired by the success of Sinkformers in unimodal settings, we introduce the extension of MPS, called Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn Attention (MPSA) , which effectively replaces cross-attention mechanisms within Transformer framework in multimodal settings. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that OTSeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant gains on Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation (ZS3) tasks across three benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for Deep Causal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing models that are capable of answering questions of the form "How would x change if y had been z?'" is fundamental to advancing medical image analysis. Training causal generative models that address such counterfactual questions, though, currently requires that all relevant variables have been observed and that the corresponding labels are available in the training data. However, clinical data may not have complete records for all patients and state of the art causal generative models are unable to take full advantage of this. We thus develop, for the first time, a semi-supervised deep causal generative model that exploits the causal relationships between variables to maximise the use of all available data. We explore this in the setting where each sample is either fully labelled or fully unlabelled, as well as the more clinically realistic case of having different labels missing for each sample. We leverage techniques from causal inference to infer missing values and subsequently generate realistic counterfactuals, even for samples with incomplete labels.</description>

      <title>Metric Learning from Limited Pairwise Preference Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study metric learning from preference comparisons under the ideal point model, in which a user prefers an item over another if it is closer to their latent ideal item. These items are embedded into $\mathbb{R}^d$ equipped with an unknown Mahalanobis distance shared across users. While recent work shows that it is possible to simultaneously recover the metric and ideal items given $\mathcal{O}(d)$ pairwise comparisons per user, in practice we often have a limited budget of $o(d)$ comparisons. We study whether the metric can still be recovered, even though it is known that learning individual ideal items is now no longer possible. We show that in general, $o(d)$ comparisons reveal no information about the metric, even with infinitely many users. However, when comparisons are made over items that exhibit low-dimensional structure, each user can contribute to learning the metric restricted to a low-dimensional subspace so that the metric can be jointly identified. We present a divide-and-conquer approach that achieves this, and provide theoretical recovery guarantees and empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Under the Hood of Tabular Data Generation Models: the Strong Impact of Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dataset-specific hyperparameter, feature encoding, and architecture tuning on five recent model families for tabular data generation through an extensive benchmark on 16 datasets. This study addresses the practical need for a unified evaluation of models that fully considers hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, we propose a reduced search space for each model that allows for quick optimization, achieving nearly equivalent performance at a significantly lower cost.Our benchmark demonstrates that, for most models, large-scale dataset-specific tuning substantially improves performance compared to the original configurations. Furthermore, we confirm that diffusion-based models generally outperform other models on tabular data. However, this advantage is not significant when the entire tuning and training process is restricted to the same GPU budget for all models.</description>

      <title>When can weak latent factors be statistically inferred?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a new and comprehensive estimation and inference theory for principal component analysis (PCA) under the weak factor model that allow for cross-sectional dependent idiosyncratic components under nearly minimal the factor strength relative to the noise level or signal-to-noise ratio. Our theory is applicable regardless of the relative growth rate between the cross-sectional dimension $N$ and temporal dimension $T$. This more realistic assumption and noticeable result requires completely new technical device, as the commonly-used leave-one-out trick is no longer applicable to the case with cross-sectional dependence. Another notable advancement of our theory is on PCA inference $ - $ for example, under the regime where $N\asymp T$, we show that the asymptotic normality for the PCA-based estimator holds as long as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) grows faster than a polynomial rate of $\log N$. This finding significantly surpasses prior work that required a polynomial rate of $N$. Our theory is entirely non-asymptotic, offering finite-sample characterizations for both the estimation error and the uncertainty level of statistical inference. A notable technical innovation is our closed-form first-order approximation of PCA-based estimator, which paves the way for various statistical tests. Furthermore, we apply our theories to design easy-to-implement statistics for validating whether given factors fall in the linear spans of unknown latent factors, testing structural breaks in the factor loadings for an individual unit, checking whether two units have the same risk exposures, and constructing confidence intervals for systematic risks. Our empirical studies uncover insightful correlations between our test results and economic cycles.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of the Bi-Directional MR with Some Invalid Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the challenging problem of estimating causal effects from purely observational data in the bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR), where some invalid instruments, as well as unmeasured confounding, usually exist. To address this problem, most existing methods attempt to find proper valid instrumental variables (IVs) for the target causal effect by expert knowledge or by assuming that the causal model is a one-directional MR model. As such, in this paper, we first theoretically investigate the identification of the bi-directional MR from observational data. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which valid IV sets are correctly identified such that the bi-directional MR model is identifiable, including the causal directions of a pair of phenotypes (i.e., the treatment and outcome). Moreover, based on the identification theory, we develop a cluster fusion-like method to discover valid IV sets and estimate the causal effects of interest. We theoretically demonstrate the correctness of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method for estimating causal effects in bi-directional MR.</description>
