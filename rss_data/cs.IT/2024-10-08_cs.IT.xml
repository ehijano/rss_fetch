      <title>Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation for Multi-UAV-Assisted Sensing, Communication, and Edge Computing Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted integrated sensing, communication, and computation network. Specifically, the treble-functional UAVs are capable of offering communication and edge computing services to mobile users (MUs) in proximity, alongside their target sensing capabilities by using multi-input multi-output arrays. For the purpose of enhance the computation efficiency, we consider task compression, where each MU can partially compress their offloaded data prior to transmission to trim its size. The objective is to minimize the weighted energy consumption by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the UAVs' trajectories, the compression and offloading partition, the computation resource allocation, while fulfilling the causal-effect correlation between communication and computation as well as adhering to the constraints on sensing quality. To tackle it, we first reformulate the original problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP), which involves heterogeneous agents to decompose the large state spaces and action spaces of MDP. Then, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with attention mechanism to handle the decision-making problem. Simulation results validate the significant effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing energy consumption. Moreover, it demonstrates superior performance compared to the baselines in relation to resource utilization and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Age of Synchronization Minimization in Wireless Networks with Random Updates and Time-Varying Timeliness Requirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers a wireless network where multiple nodes transmit status updates to a base station (BS) via a shared, error-free channel with limited bandwidth. The status updates arrive at each node randomly. We use the Age of Synchronization (AoS) as a metric to measure the information freshness of the updates. The AoS of each node has a timely-varying importance which follows a Markov chain. Our objective is to minimize the weighted sum AoS of the system. The optimization problem is relaxed and formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Solving the relaxed CMDP by a linear programming algorithm yields a stationary policy, which helps us propose a near-stationary policy for the original problem. Numerical simulations show that in most configurations, the AoS performance of our policy outperforms the policy choosing the maximum AoS regardless of weight variations.</description>

      <title>OD-Stega: LLM-Based Near-Imperceptible Steganography via Optimized Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider coverless steganography where a Large Language Model (LLM) drives an arithmetic coding decoder to generate stego-texts. An efficient method should embed secret message bits in as few language tokens as possible, while still keeping the stego-text natural and fluent. We show that on the individual token level, this problem is mathematically equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a replacement probability distribution of the next token generation, subject to a constraint on the KL divergence between the chosen probability distribution and the original distribution given by the LLM. A closed-form solution is provided for the optimization problem, which can be computed efficiently. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An often-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt selection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the vocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The combination of the optimized distribution with other sequence-level selection heuristics to further enhance the efficiency and reliability is studied.</description>

      <title>Anti-Malicious ISAC Using Proactive Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate proactive monitoring to mitigate malicious activities in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our focus is on a scenario where a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) architecture is exploited by malicious actors. Malicious actors use multiple access points (APs) to illegally sense a legitimate target while communicating with users (UEs), one of which is suspected of illegal activities. In our approach, a proactive monitor overhears the suspicious UE and simultaneously sends a jamming signal to degrade the communication links between the APs and suspicious UE. Simultaneously, the monitor sends a precoded jamming signal toward the legitimate target to hinder the malicious sensing attempts. We derive closed-form expressions for the sensing signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), as well as the received SINR at the UEs and overheard SINR at the monitor. The simulation results show that our anti-malicious CF-mMIMO ISAC strategy can significantly reduce the sensing performance while offering excellent monitoring performance.</description>

      <title>Log-Concave Sequences in Coding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of logarithmically concave (or log-concave) sequences in Coding Theory. A sequence $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n$ of real numbers is called log-concave if $a_i^2 \ge a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$ for all $1 \le i \le n-1$. A natural sequence of positive numbers in coding theory is the weight distribution of a linear code consisting of the nonzero values among $A_i$'s where $A_i$ denotes the number of codewords of weight $i$. We call a linear code log-concave if its nonzero weight distribution is log-concave. Our main contribution is to show that all binary general Hamming codes of length $2^r -1$ ($r=3$ or $r \ge 5$), the binary extended Hamming codes of length $2^r ~(r \ge 3)$, and the second order Reed-Muller codes $R(2, m)~ (m \ge 2)$ are all log-concave while the homogeneous and projective second order Reed-Muller codes are either log-concave, or 1-gap log-concave. Furthermore, we show that any MDS $[n, k]$ code over $\mathbb F_q$ satisfying $3 \leqslant k \leqslant n/2 +3$ is log-concave if $q \geqslant q_0(n, k)$ which is the larger root of a quadratic polynomial. Hence, we expect that the concept of log-concavity in coding theory will stimulate many interesting problems.</description>

      <title>Spatial Multiplexing Oriented Channel Reconfiguration in Multi-IRS Aided MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial multiplexing plays a significant role in improving the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. To improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of a point-to-point MIMO system, we exploit the channel reconfiguration capabilities provided by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to enhance the spatial multiplexing. Unlike most existing works, we address both the issues of the IRSs placement and elements allocation. To this end, we first introduce an orthogonal placement strategy to mitigate channel correlation, thereby enabling interference-free multi-stream transmission. Subsequently, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach to jointly optimize the IRS elements and power allocation. Our theoretical analysis unveils that equal IRS elements/power allocation scheme becomes asymptotically optimal as the number of IRS elements and transmit power tend to be infinite. Numerical results demonstrate that when the total number of IRS elements or the power exceeds a certain threshold, a multi-IRS assisted system outperforms a single IRS configuration.</description>

      <title>Partial reciprocity-based precoding matrix prediction in FDD massive MIMO with mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The timely precoding of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is a substantial challenge in practice, especially in mobile environments. In order to improve the precoding performance and reduce the precoding complexity, we propose a partial reciprocity-based precoding matrix prediction scheme and further reduce its complexity by exploiting the channel gram matrix. We prove that the precoders can be predicted through a closed-form eigenvector interpolation which was based on the periodic eigenvector samples. Numerical results validate the performance improvements of our schemes over the conventional schemes from 30 km/h to 500 km/h of moving speed.</description>

      <title>Round Trip Time Estimation Utilizing Cyclic Shift of Uplink Reference Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) technology, it is not possible to directly obtain an absolute uplink (UL) channel impulse response (CIR) at the base station (gNB) from a user equipment (UE). The UL CIR obtained through the sounding reference signal (SRS) is always time-shifted by the timing advance (TA) applied at the UE. The TA is crucial for maintaining UL synchronization, and transmitting SRS without applying the TA will result in interference. In this work, we propose a new method to obtain absolute UL CIR from a UE and then use it to estimate the round trip time (RTT) at the gNB. This method requires enhancing the current 5G protocol stack with a new Zadoff-Chu (ZC) based wideband uplink reference signal (URS). Capitalizing on the cyclic shift property of the URS sequence, we can obtain the RTT with a significant reduction in overhead and latency compared to existing schemes. The proposed method is experimentally validated using a real-world testbed based on OpenAirInterface (OAI).</description>

      <title>Power Minimization with Rate Constraints for Multi-User MIMO Systems with Large-Size RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the optimization of a single-cell multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple large-size reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The overall transmit power is minimized by optimizing the precoding coefficients and the RIS configuration, with constraints on users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). The minimization problem is divided into two sub-problems and solved by means of an iterative alternating optimization (AO) approach. The first sub-problem focuses on finding the best precoder design. The second sub-problem optimizes the configuration of the RISs by partitioning them into smaller tiles. Each tile is then configured as a combination of pre-defined configurations. This allows the efficient optimization of RISs, especially in scenarios where the computational complexity would be prohibitive using traditional approaches. Simulation results show the good performance and limited complexity of the proposed method in comparison to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Study of Tomlinson-Harashima Precoders for Rate-Splitting-Based Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) systems have the potential to fulfill the increasing performance demand of future wireless applications by employing distributed access points (APs) that transmit the information over the same time-frequency resources. Due to the simultaneous transmission, multiuser interference (MUI) degrades the overall performance. To cope with the MUI in the downlink several linear precoding techniques, which rely on perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), have been studied. However, perfect CSIT is hardly obtained in practical systems. In this context, rate-splitting (RS) has arisen as a potential solution to deal with CSIT imperfections. In contrast to existing works, we explore non-linear precoding techniques along with RS-CF systems. Furthermore, the multi-branch (MB) concept is included to further enhance the overall performance of the system. Simulations show that the proposed MB-THP for RS-based CF systems outperforms the conventional linear precoders.</description>

      <title>Coverage Analysis for 3D Indoor Terahertz Communication System Over Fluctuating Two-Ray Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel analytical framework for a three-dimensional (3D) indoor terahertz (THz) communication system. Our proposed model incorporates more accurate modeling of wall blockages via Manhattan line processes and precise modeling of THz fading channels via a fluctuating two-ray (FTR) channel model. We also account for traditional unique features of THz, such as molecular absorption loss, user blockages, and 3D directional antenna beams. Moreover, we model locations of access points (APs) using a Poisson point process and adopt the nearest line-of-sight AP association strategy. Due to the high penetration loss caused by wall blockages, we consider that a user equipment (UE) and its associated AP and interfering APs are all in the same rectangular area, i.e., a room. Based on the proposed rectangular area model, we evaluate the impact of the UE's location on the distance to its associated AP. We then develop a tractable method to derive a new expression for the coverage probability by examining the interference from interfering APs and considering the FTR fading experienced by THz communications. Aided by simulation results, we validate our analysis and demonstrate that the UE's location has a pronounced impact on its coverage probability. Additionally, we find that the optimal AP density is determined by both the UE's location and the room size, which provides valuable insights for meeting the coverage requirements of future THz communication system deployment.</description>

      <title>Uni-polarized RIS Beamforming for Improving Connectivity of Multi-RIS-Assisted D2D Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method to enhance the connectivity of multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted device-to-device networks, referred to as multi-RIS-assisted D2D networks, through a unique phase shift determination. The proposed method aims to optimize the power-domain array factor (PDAF), targeting specific azimuth angles of reliable user equipments (UEs) and enhancing network connectivity. We formulate an optimization problem that jointly optimizes RIS beamforming design, RIS-aided link selection, and RIS positioning. This problem is a mixed-integer non-binary programming. The optimization problem is divided into two sub-problems, which are solved individually and iteratively. The first sub-problem of RIS-aided link selection is solved using an efficient perturbation method while developing genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain RIS beamforming design. The GA optimizes the RIS phase shift to generate multiple RIS-aided narrowbeams that exhibit significant PDAF towards azimuth angles of interest while minimizing PDAF towards undesired azimuth angles. The second sub-problem of RIS positioning is addressed using the Adam optimizer. Numerical simulations verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving network connectivity compared to other schemes, including those utilizing distributed small RISs, each generating one RIS-aided link.</description>

      <title>Distributed Collaborative User Positioning for Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output system, which exhibits great potential in enhancing the capabilities of next-generation mobile communication networks. We first study the distributed positioning problem to lay the groundwork for solving resource allocation and interference management issues. Instead of relying on computationally and spatially complex fingerprint positioning methods, we propose a novel two-stage distributed collaborative positioning architecture with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) network, consisting of a received signal strength-based preliminary positioning network and an angle of arrival-based auxiliary correction network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage distributed collaborative user positioning architecture can outperform conventional fingerprint positioning methods in terms of positioning accuracy.</description>

      <title>High Information Density and Low Coverage Data Storage in DNA with Efficient Channel Coding Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA-based data storage has been attracting significant attention due to its extremely high density, low power consumption, and long duration compared to traditional data storage mediums. Despite the recent advancements in DNA data storage technology, significant challenges remain. In particular, various types of errors can occur during the processes of DNA synthesis, storage, and sequencing, including substitution errors, insertion errors, and deletion errors. Furthermore, the entire oligo may be lost. In this work, we report a DNA-based data storage architecture that incorporates efficient channel coding schemes, including different types of error-correcting codes (ECCs) and constrained codes, for both the inner coding and outer coding for the DNA data storage channel. We also carry out large scale experiments to validate our proposed DNA data storage architecture. Specifically, 1.61 and 1.69 MB data are encoded into 30,000 oligos each, with information densities of 1.731 and 1.815, respectively. It has been found that the stored information can be fully recovered without any error at average coverages 4.5 and 6.0, respectively. Compared to previous experimental studies, our architecture achieves higher information density and lower coverage, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed channel coding schemes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Peak-Power Limited (PPL) Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels in which the signal is band-limited, and its instantaneous power cannot exceed the power P. This model is relevant to many communication systems; however, its capacity is still unknown. We use a new geometry-based approach which evaluates the maximal entropy of the transmitted signal by assessing the volume of the body, in the space of Nyquist-rate samples, comprising all the points the transmitted signal can reach. This leads to lower bounds on capacity which are tight at high Signal to Noise Ratios (SNR). We found lower bounds on capacity, expressed as power efficiency, higher than the known ones by a factor of 3.35 and 8.6 in the low pass and the band pass cases respectively. The gap to the upper bounds is reduced to a power ratio of 1.5. The new bounds are numerically evaluated for FDMA-style signals with limited duration and also derived in the general case as a conjecture. The penalty in power efficiency due to the peak power constraint is roughly 6 dB at high SNR. Further research is needed to develop effective modulation and coding for this channel.</description>

      <title>Noise-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present noise-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (ND-NOMA), an innovative communication scheme that utilizes the modulation of artificial noise mean and variance to convey information. Distinct from traditional methods such as power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) that heavily relies on successive interference cancellation (SIC), ND-NOMA utilizes the noise domain, considerably reducing power consumption and system complexity. Inspired by noise modulation, ND-NOMA enhances energy efficiency and provides lower bit error probability (BEP), making it highly suitable for next-generation Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. Our theoretical analyses and computer simulations reveal that ND-NOMA can achieve exceptionally low bit error rates in both uplink and downlink scenarios, in the presence of Rician fading channels. The proposed multi-user system is supported by a minimum distance detector for mean detection and a threshold-based detector for variance detection, ensuring robust communication in low-power environments. By leveraging the inherent properties of noise, ND-NOMA offers a promising platform for long-term deployments of low-cost and low-complexity devices.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Model for Physical Layer Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical layer deception (PLD) is a novel security mechanism that combines physical layer security (PLS) with deception technologies to actively defend against eavesdroppers. In this paper, we establish a novel semantic model for PLD that evaluates its performance in terms of semantic distortion. By analyzing semantic distortion at varying levels of knowledge on the receiver's part regarding the key, we derive the receiver's optimal decryption strategy, and consequently, the transmitter's optimal deception strategy. The proposed semantic model provides a more generic understanding of the PLD approach independent from coding or multiplexing schemes, and allows for efficient real-time adaptation to fading channels.</description>

      <title>Extended Functional Representation Lemma: A Tool For Privacy, Semantic Representation, Caching, and Compression Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of a problem in information-theoretic privacy mechanism design, addressing two scenarios in which private data is either observable or hidden. In each scenario, different privacy measures are used, including bounded mutual information and two types of per-letter privacy constraints. Considering the first scenario, an agent observes useful data that is correlated with private data, and wants to disclose the useful information to a user. Due to the privacy concerns, direct disclosure is prohibited. Hence, a privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the revealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy constraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the private data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong Functional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for designing low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal privacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another privacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more private than the remaining part. Finally, we provide applications including semantic communications, caching and delivery, and compression designs, where the approach can be applied.</description>

      <title>Sparse Degree Optimization for BATS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batched sparse (BATS) code is a class of batched network code that can achieve a close-to-optimal rate when an optimal degree distribution is provided. We observed that most probability masses in this optimal distribution are very small, i.e., the distribution "looks" sparse. In this paper, we investigate the sparsity optimization of degree distribution for BATS codes that produces sparse degree distributions. There are many advantages to use a sparse degree distribution, say, it is robust to precision errors when sampling the degree distribution during encoding and decoding in practice. We discuss a few heuristics and also a way to obtain an exact sparsity solution. These approaches give a trade-off between computational time and achievable rate, thus give us the flexibility to adopt BATS codes in various scenarios, e.g., device with limited computational power, stable channel condition, etc.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Based Multi-Objective Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communications in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where multiple UAVs simultaneously sense the locations of ground users and provide communication services with radars. To find the trade-off between communication and sensing (C\&amp;S) in the system, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to maximize the total network utility and the localization Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRB) of ground users, which jointly optimizes the deployment and power control of UAVs. Inspired by the huge potential of large language models (LLM) for prediction and inference, we propose an LLM-enabled decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (LEDMA) for solving the highly non-convex MOP. We first adopt a decomposition-based scheme to decompose the MOP into a series of optimization sub-problems. We second integrate LLMs as black-box search operators with MOP-specifically designed prompt engineering into the framework of MOEA to solve optimization sub-problems simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed LEDMA can find the clear trade-off between C\&amp;S and outperforms baseline MOEAs in terms of obtained Pareto fronts and convergence.</description>

      <title>Quantization Design for Resistive Memories With Multiple Reads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the crossbar array architecture, the sneak-path problem severely degrades the data integrity in the resistive random access memory (ReRAM). In this letter, we investigate the channel quantizer design for ReRAM arrays with multiple reads, which is a typical technique to improve the data recovery performance of data storage systems. Starting with a quantized channel model of ReRAM with multiple reads, we first derive a general approach for designing the channel quantizer, for both single-bit and multiple-bit quantization. We then focus on the single-bit quantization, which is highly suitable for practical applications of ReRAM. In particular, we propose a semi-analytical approach to design the multiple-read single-bit quantizer with less complexity. We also derive the theoretical bit-error probability of the optimal single-bit detector/quantization as the benchmark. Results indicate that the multiple-read operation is effective in improving the error rate performance of ReRAM. Moreover, our proposed multiple-read detector outperforms the prior art detector and achieves the performance of the optimal detector.</description>

      <title>Union Bound Analysis for Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) With Channel Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology, spin-torque transfer magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) has received great attention in recent years since it combines the features of low switching energy, fast write/read speed, and high scalability. However, process variation and thermal fluctuation severely affect the data integrity of STT-MRAM, resulting in both write errors and read errors. Therefore, effective error correction codes (ECCs) are necessary for correcting memory cell errors. Meanwhile, the design of channel quantizer plays a critical role in supporting error correction coding for STT-MRAM. In this work, we propose a union bound analysis which can accurately predict the word error rates (WERs) of ECCs with maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding over the quantized STT-MRAM channel. The derived bound provides a theoretical tool for comparing the performance of ECCs with different quantization schemes at very low error rate levels without resorting to lengthy computer simulations. Moreover, we also propose a new criterion to design the channel quantizer by minimizing the WERs of ECC decoding that are obtained from the union bound analysis. Numerical results show that the proposed union-bound-optimized (UBO) quantizer can achieve better error rate performance than the state-of-art quantizers for STT-MRAM.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Potential: Integrating Multihop, CRC, and GRAND for Wireless 5G-Beyond/6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As future wireless networks move towards millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequencies for 6G, multihop transmission using Integrated Access Backhaul (IABs) and Network-Controlled Repeaters (NCRs) will be highly essential to overcome coverage limitations. This paper examines the use of Guessing Random Additive Noise (GRAND) decoding for multihop transmissions in 3GPP networks. We explore two scenarios: one where only the destination uses GRAND decoding, and another where both relays and the destination leverage it. Interestingly, in the latter scenario, the Bit Error Rate (BER) curves for all hop counts intersect at a specific Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which we term the GRAND barrier. This finding offers valuable insights for future research and 3GPP standard development. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of GRAND in improving communication speed and quality, contributing to the robustness and interconnectivity of future wireless systems, particularly relevant for the migration towards mmWave and THz bands in 6G networks. Finally, we investigate the integration of multihop transmission, CRC detection, and GRAND decoding within 3GPP networks, demonstrating their potential to overcome coverage limitations and enhance overall network performance.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning-Based Adaptive Error-Correction Decoding for Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-torque transfer magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) is a promising emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology with wide applications. However, the data recovery of STT-MRAM is affected by the diversity of channel raw bit error rate (BER) across different dies caused by process variations, as well as the unknown resistance offset due to temperature change. Therefore, it is critical to develop effective decoding algorithms of error correction codes (ECCs) for STT-MRAM. In this article, we first propose a neural bit-flipping (BF) decoding algorithm, which can share the same trellis representation as the state-of-the-art neural decoding algorithms, such as the neural belief propagation (NBP) and neural offset min-sum (NOMS) algorithm. Hence, a neural network (NN) decoder with a uniform architecture but different NN parameters can realize all these neural decoding algorithms. Based on such a unified NN decoder architecture, we further propose a novel deep-learning (DL)-based adaptive decoding algorithm whose decoding complexity can be adjusted according to the change of the channel conditions of STT-MRAM. Extensive experimental evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed neural decoders can greatly improve the performance over the standard decoders, with similar decoding latency and energy consumption. Moreover, the DL-based adaptive decoder can work well over different channel conditions of STT-MRAM irrespective of the unknown resistance offset, with a 50% reduction of the decoding latency and energy consumption compared to the fixed decoder.</description>

      <title>Sample-Optimal Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices. A recent study has proved that, with Haar random projective measurements, only a $O(n^3)$ number of state copies is required to guarantee bounded recovery error of an matrix product operator (MPO) state of qubits $n$. While this result provides a formal evidence that quantum states with an efficient classical representation can be reconstructed with an efficient number of state copies, the number of state copies required is still significantly larger than the number of independent parameters in the classical representation.
  In this paper, we attempt to narrow this gap and study whether the number of state copies can saturate the information theoretic bound (i.e., $O(n)$, the number of parameters in the MPOs) using physical quantum measurements. We answer this question affirmatively by using a class of Informationally Complete Positive Operator-Valued Measures (IC-POVMs), including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\ge3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is needed for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO. Moreover, we propose a projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm to solve the constrained least-squares problem and show that it can efficiently find an estimate with bounded recovery error when appropriately initialized.</description>

Abstract: Efficient satellite communications play an enormously important role in all of our daily lives. This includes the transmission of data for communication purposes, the operation of IoT applications or the provision of data for ground stations. More and more, AI-based methods are finding their way into these areas. This paper gives an overview of current research in the field of intelligent optimization of satellite communication. For this purpose, a text-mining based literature review was conducted and the identified papers were thematically clustered and analyzed. The identified clusters cover the main topics of routing, resource allocation and, load balancing. Through such a clustering of the literature in overarching topics, a structured analysis of the research papers was enabled, allowing the identification of latest technologies and approaches as well as research needs for intelligent optimization of satellite communication.</description>

      <title>Compression via Pre-trained Transformers: A Study on Byte-Level Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have recently been shown to be strong data compressors. However, when accounting for their excessive parameter count, their compression ratios are actually inferior to standard compression algorithms. Moreover, naively reducing the number of parameters may not necessarily help as it leads to worse predictions and thus weaker compression. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to investigate whether there is a sweet spot where competitive compression ratios with pre-trained vanilla transformers are possible. To this end, we train families of models on 165GB of raw byte sequences of either text, image, or audio data (and all possible combinations of the three) and then compress 1GB of out-of-distribution (OOD) data from each modality. We find that relatively small models (i.e., millions of parameters) can outperform standard general-purpose compression algorithms (gzip, LZMA2) and even domain-specific compressors (PNG, JPEG 2000, FLAC) - even when factoring in parameter count. We achieve, e.g., the lowest compression ratio of 0.49 on OOD audio data (vs. 0.54 for FLAC). To study the impact of model- and dataset scale, we conduct extensive ablations and hyperparameter sweeps, and we investigate the effect of unimodal versus multimodal training. We find that even small models can be trained to perform well on multiple modalities, but, in contrast to previously reported results with large-scale foundation models, transfer to unseen modalities is generally weak.</description>

      <title>Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam with Interaction: A Unifying Lower Bound Framework and Characterization for Bandit Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a unified framework for lower bound methods in statistical estimation and interactive decision making. Classical lower bound techniques -- such as Fano's inequality, Le Cam's method, and Assouad's lemma -- have been central to the study of minimax risk in statistical estimation, yet they are insufficient for the analysis of methods that collect data in an interactive manner. The recent minimax lower bounds for interactive decision making via the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC) appear to be genuinely different from the classical methods. We propose a unified view of these distinct methodologies through a general algorithmic lower bound method. We further introduce a novel complexity measure, decision dimension, which facilitates the derivation of new lower bounds for interactive decision making. In particular, decision dimension provides a characterization of bandit learnability for any structured bandit model class. Further, we characterize the sample complexity of learning convex model class up to a polynomial gap with the decision dimension, addressing the remaining gap between upper and lower bounds in Foster et al. (2021, 2023).</description>

Abstract: Long quantum codes using projective Reed-Muller codes are constructed. Projective Reed-Muller codes are evaluation codes obtained by evaluating homogeneous polynomials at the projective space. We obtain asymmetric and symmetric quantum codes by using the CSS construction and the Hermitian construction, respectively. We provide entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes from projective Reed-Muller codes with flexible amounts of entanglement by considering equivalent codes. Moreover, we also construct quantum codes from subfield subcodes of projective Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security Performance of Cooperative Dual RIS-aided V2V NOMA Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system, where a transmitter vehicle exploits a dual reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to send confidential information to legitimate receiver vehicles under the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme in the presence of an eavesdropper vehicle. In particular, it is assumed that an RIS is near the transmitter vehicle and another RIS is close to the receiver vehicles to provide a wider smart radio environment. Besides, we suppose that the channels between two RISs suffer from the Fisher-Snedecor F fading model. Under this scenario, we first provide the marginal distributions of equivalent channels at the legitimate receiver vehicles by exploiting the central limit theorem (CLT). Then, in order to evaluate the PLS performance of the considered secure communication system, we derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by using the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and the Gaussian quadrature techniques. Moreover, to gain more insights into the secrecy performance, the asymptotic expression of the ASC is obtained. The numerical results indicate that incorporating the dual RIS in the secure V2V communication under the NOMA scheme can significantly provide ultra-reliable transmission and guarantee more secure communication for intelligent transportation systems (ITS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of wireless communications has been significantly influenced by remarkable advancements in multiple access (MA) technologies over the past five decades, shaping the landscape of modern connectivity. Within this context, a comprehensive tutorial review is presented, focusing on representative MA techniques developed over the past 50 years. The following areas are explored: i) The foundational principles and information-theoretic capacity limits of power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are characterized, along with its extension to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA. ii) Several MA transmission schemes exploiting the spatial domain are investigated, encompassing both conventional space-division multiple access (SDMA)/MIMO-NOMA systems and near-field MA systems utilizing spherical-wave propagation models. iii) The application of NOMA to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems is studied. This includes an introduction to typical NOMA-based downlink/uplink ISAC frameworks, followed by an evaluation of their performance limits using a mutual information (MI)-based analytical framework. iv) Major issues and research opportunities associated with the integration of MA with other emerging technologies are identified to facilitate MA in next-generation networks, i.e., next-generation multiple access (NGMA). Throughout the paper, promising directions are highlighted to inspire future research endeavors in the realm of MA and NGMA.</description>

      <title>Molecular Arithmetic Coding (MoAC) and Optimized Molecular Prefix Coding (MoPC) for Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables information transfer through molecules at the nano-scale. This paper presents new and optimized source coding (data compression) methods for MC. In a recent paper, prefix source coding was introduced into the field, through an MC-adapted version of the Huffman coding. We first show that while MC-adapted Huffman coding improves symbol error rate (SER), it does not always produce an optimal prefix codebook in terms of coding length and power. To address this, we propose optimal molecular prefix coding (MoPC). The major result of this paper is the Molecular Arithmetic Coding (MoAC), which we derive based on an existing general construction principle for constrained arithmetic channel coding, equipping it with error correction and data compression capabilities for any finite source alphabet. We theoretically and practically show the superiority of MoAC to SAC, our another adaptation of arithmetic source coding to MC. However, MoAC's unique decodability is limited by bit precision. Accordingly, a uniquely-decodable new coding scheme named Molecular Arithmetic with Prefix Coding (MoAPC) is introduced. On two nucleotide alphabets, we show that MoAPC has a better compression performance than MoPC. MC simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theory of Pragmatic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12324v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard information theory says nothing about how much meaning is conveyed by a message. We fill this gap with a rigorously justifiable, quantitative definition of ``pragmatic information'', the amount of meaning in a message relevant to a particular decision. We posit that such a message updates a random variable, $\omega$, that informs the decision. The pragmatic information of a single message is then defined as the Kulbach-Leibler divergence between the apriori and aposteriori probabilities of $\omega$; the pragmatic information of a message ensemble is the expected value of the pragmatic information of the ensemble's component messages. We justify these definitions by proving that the pragmatic information of a single message is the expected difference between the shortest binary encoding of $\omega$ under the a priori and a posteriori distributions, and that the average of the pragmatic values of individual messages, when sampled a large number of times from the ensemble, approaches its expected value.
  Pragmatic information is non-negative and additive for independent decisions and ``pragmatically independent'' messages. Also, pragmatic information is the information analogue of free energy: just as free energy quantifies the part of a system's total energy available to do useful work, so pragmatic information quantifies the information actually used in making a decision.
  We sketch 3 applications: the single play of a slot machine, a.k.a. a ``one armed bandit'', with an unknown payout probability; a characterization of the rate of biological evolution in the so-called ``quasi-species'' model; and a reformulation of the efficient market hypothesis of finance. We note the importance of the computational capacity of the receiver in each case.</description>

      <title>On Nearly Perfect Covering Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly perfect packing codes are those codes that meet the Johnson upper bound on the size of error-correcting codes. This bound is an improvement to the sphere-packing bound. A related bound for covering codes is known as the van Wee bound. Codes that meet this bound will be called nearly perfect covering codes. In this paper, such codes with covering radius one will be considered. It will be proved that these codes can be partitioned into three families depending on the smallest distance between neighboring codewords. Some of the codes contained in these families will be completely characterized. Other properties of these codes will be considered too. Construction for codes for each such family will be presented, the weight distribution and the distance distribution of codes from these families are characterized. Finally, extended nearly perfect covering code will be considered and unexpected equivalence classes of codes of the three types will be defined based on the extended codes.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning via Cross-Prediction-Powered Inference for Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many wireless application scenarios, acquiring labeled data can be prohibitively costly, requiring complex optimization processes or measurement campaigns. Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled samples to augment the available dataset by assigning synthetic labels obtained via machine learning (ML)-based predictions. However, treating the synthetic labels as true labels may yield worse-performing models as compared to models trained using only labeled data. Inspired by the recently developed prediction-powered inference (PPI) framework, this work investigates how to leverage the synthetic labels produced by an ML model, while accounting for the inherent bias concerning true labels. To this end, we first review PPI and its recent extensions, namely tuned PPI and cross-prediction-powered inference (CPPI). Then, we introduce two novel variants of PPI. The first, referred to as tuned CPPI, provides CPPI with an additional degree of freedom in adapting to the quality of the ML-based labels. The second, meta-CPPI (MCPPI), extends tuned CPPI via the joint optimization of the ML labeling models and of the parameters of interest. Finally, we showcase two applications of PPI-based techniques in wireless systems, namely beam alignment based on channel knowledge maps in millimeter-wave systems and received signal strength information-based indoor localization. Simulation results show the advantages of PPI-based techniques over conventional approaches that rely solely on labeled data or that apply standard pseudo-labeling strategies from semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, the proposed tuned CPPI method is observed to guarantee the best performance among all benchmark schemes, especially in the regime of limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy-Harvesting Hybrid VLC/RF Networks with Random Receiver Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an indoor hybrid visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) scenario with two-hop downlink transmission. A light emitting diode (LED) transmits both data and energy via VLC to an energy-harvesting relay node, which then uses the harvested energy to retransmit the decoded information to an RF user in the second phase. The design parameters include the direct current (DC) bias and the time allocation for VLC transmission. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the data rate under decode-and-forward relaying with fixed receiver orientation. The non-convex problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, solved iteratively by fixing one parameter while optimizing the other. Additionally, we analyze the impact of random receiver orientation on the data rate, deriving closed-form expressions for both VLC and RF rates. An exhaustive search approach is employed to solve the optimization, demonstrating that joint optimization of DC bias and time allocation significantly enhances the data rate compared to optimizing DC bias alone.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gradient Estimation of Variational Quantum Circuits with Lie Algebraic Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical optimization and learning strategies are among the most promising approaches to harnessing quantum information or gaining a quantum advantage over classical methods. However, efficient estimation of the gradient of the objective function in such models remains a challenge due to several factors including the exponential dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces, and information loss of quantum measurements. In this work, we developed an efficient framework that makes the Hadamard test efficiently applicable to gradient estimation for a broad range of quantum systems, an advance that had been wanting from the outset. Under certain mild structural assumptions, the gradient is estimated with the measurement shots that scale logarithmically with the number of parameters and with polynomial classical and quantum time. This is an exponential reduction in the measurement cost and polynomial speed up in time compared to existing works. The structural assumptions are (1) the dimension of the dynamical Lie algebra is polynomial in the number of qubits, and (2) the observable has a bounded Hilbert-Schmidt norm.</description>

      <title>Just Wing It: Near-Optimal Estimation of Missing Mass in a Markovian Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the stationary mass -- also called the unigram mass -- that is missing from a single trajectory of a discrete-time, ergodic Markov chain. This problem has several applications -- for example, estimating the stationary missing mass is critical for accurately smoothing probability estimates in sequence models. While the classical Good--Turing estimator from the 1950s has appealing properties for i.i.d. data, it is known to be biased in the Markovian setting, and other heuristic estimators do not come equipped with guarantees. Operating in the general setting in which the size of the state space may be much larger than the length $n$ of the trajectory, we develop a linear-runtime estimator called Windowed Good--Turing (WingIt) and show that its risk decays as $\widetilde{O}(\mathsf{T_{mix}}/n)$, where $\mathsf{T_{mix}}$ denotes the mixing time of the chain in total variation distance. Notably, this rate is independent of the size of the state space and minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor in $n / \mathsf{T_{mix}}$. We also present an upper bound on the variance of the missing mass random variable, which may be of independent interest. We extend our estimator to approximate the stationary mass placed on elements occurring with small frequency in the trajectory. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our estimators both in simulations on canonical chains and on sequences constructed from natural language text.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Private Density Estimation for GMMs via List Global Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of private density estimation for mixtures of unrestricted high dimensional Gaussians in the agnostic setting. We prove the first upper bound on the sample complexity of this problem. Previously, private learnability of high dimensional GMMs was only known in the realizable setting [Afzali et al., 2024].
  To prove our result, we exploit the notion of $\textit{list global stability}$ [Ghazi et al., 2021b,a] that was originally introduced in the context of private supervised learning. We define an agnostic variant of this definition, showing that its existence is sufficient for agnostic private density estimation. We then construct an agnostic list globally stable learner for GMMs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Framework for Channel Simulation-Based Base Station Placement and Transmission Power Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an adaptive experimental design framework for a channel-simulation-based base station (BS) design that supports the joint optimization of transmission power and placement. We consider a system in which multiple transmitters provide wireless services over a shared frequency band. Our objective is to maximize the average throughput within an area of interest. System operators can design the system configurations prior to deployment by iterating them through channel simulations and updating the parameters. However, accurate channel simulations are computationally expensive; therefore, it is preferable to configure the system using a limited number of simulation iterations. We develop a solver for the problem based on Bayesian optimization (BO), a black-box optimization method. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve 18-22% higher throughput performance than conventional placement and power optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Error exponent of activated non-signaling assisted classical-quantum channel coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a tight asymptotic characterization of the error exponent for classical-quantum channel coding assisted by activated non-signaling correlations. Namely, we find that the optimal exponent--also called reliability function--is equal to the well-known sphere packing bound, which can be written as a single-letter formula optimized over Petz-R\'enyi divergences. Remarkably, there is no critical rate and as such our characterization remains tight for arbitrarily low rates below the capacity. On the achievability side, we further extend our results to fully quantum channels. Our proofs rely on semi-definite program duality and a dual representation of the Petz-R\'enyi divergences via Young inequalities.</description>

      <title>softmax is not enough (for sharp out-of-distribution)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key property of reasoning systems is the ability to make sharp decisions on their input data. For contemporary AI systems, a key carrier of sharp behaviour is the softmax function, with its capability to perform differentiable query-key lookups. It is a common belief that the predictive power of networks leveraging softmax arises from "circuits" which sharply perform certain kinds of computations consistently across many diverse inputs. However, for these circuits to be robust, they would need to generalise well to arbitrary valid inputs. In this paper, we dispel this myth: even for tasks as simple as finding the maximum key, any learned circuitry must disperse as the number of items grows at test time. We attribute this to a fundamental limitation of the softmax function to robustly approximate sharp functions, prove this phenomenon theoretically, and propose adaptive temperature as an ad-hoc technique for improving the sharpness of softmax at inference time.</description>
