      <title>On the validity of the complex Langevin method near the deconfining phase transition in QCD at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )&gt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L &lt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</description>

      <title>Method for high-precision determination of the nucleon axial structure using lattice QCD: Removing $\pi N$-state contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a precise calculation of physical quantities related to the axial structure of the nucleon using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD gauge configuration (PACS10 configuration) generated at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\;{\mathrm{fm}})^4$ by the PACS Collaboration. The nucleon matrix element of the axial-vector current has two types of the nucleon form factors, the axial-vector ($F_A$) form factor and the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) form factor. Recently lattice QCD simulations have succeeded in reproducing the experimental value of the axial-vector coupling, $g_A$, determined from $F_A(q^2)$ at zero momentum transfer $q^2=0$, at a percent level of statistical accuracy. However, the $F_P$ form factor so far has not reproduced the experimental values well due to strong $\pi N$ excited-state contamination. Therefore, we proposed a simple subtraction method for removing the so-called leading $\pi N$-state contribution, and succeeded in reproducing the values obtained by two experiments of muon capture on the proton and pion electro-production for $F_P(q^2)$. The novel approach can also be applied to the nucleon pseudoscalar matrix element to determine the pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factor with the help of the axial Wald-Takahashi identity. The resulting form factors, $F_P(q^2)$ and $G_P(q^2)$, are in good agreement with the prediction of the pion-pole dominance model. In the new analysis, the induced pseudoscalar coupling $g_P^\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{\pi NN}$ can be evaluated with a few percent accuracy including systematic uncertainties using existing data calculated at two lattice spacings.</description>

      <title>Training neural control variates using correlated configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation via Large-Language-Model-Driven Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an automated framework for quantum circuit design by integrating large-language models (LLMs) with evolutionary optimization to overcome the rigidity, scalability limitations, and expert dependence of traditional ones in variational quantum algorithms. Our approach (FunSearch) autonomously discovers hardware-efficient ans\"atze with new features of scalability and system-size-independent number of variational parameters entirely from scratch. Demonstrations on the Ising and XY spin chains with n = 9 qubits yield circuits containing 4 parameters, achieving near-exact energy extrapolation across system sizes. Implementations on quantum hardware (Zuchongzhi chip) validate practicality, where two-qubit quantum gate noises can be effectively mitigated via zero-noise extrapolations for a spin chain system as large as 20 sites. This framework bridges algorithmic design and experimental constraints, complementing contemporary quantum architecture search frameworks to advance scalable quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Approximate Minimal SU(5), Several Fundamental Scales, Fluctuating Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Having shortly reviewed our idea of the grand unified SU(5) being only exact in a classical limit, in a truly existing lattice, an ontological lattice, we go over to putting a series of different physical energy scales such the approximate unification scale for the SU(5)(without any SUSY), the Planck scale, and e.g. the scale of see-saw neutrino masses into a certain plot showing the energy scales on a straight line. This straight line of this plot supposed to result from such an ontological lattice, that fluctuates in link size a and lattice density in a very strong way according to a log normal distribution. The point is that different energy scales result from the link size of the lattice to different powers, like the averages a to the n th , where the power n depends on the type of scale considered. Since the n th root of the average of the n th power of the link size in the fluctuating lattice is very strongly dependent on the power n, because of very huge fluctuations, the different types of physical energy scales can get very different. With a Galton i.e. log normal distribution of the link size the various energy scales have their logarithms fall into a nice straight line versus the power of the link size, on which they depend. Our model gives a surprisingly good number for the small deviations of the experimental electron-and muon-anomalous magnetic moment from the pure Standard Model value.</description>

      <title>Flowing from the Ising Model on the Fuzzy Sphere to the 3D Lee-Yang CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.</description>

      <title>Path optimization method for the sign problem caused by fermion determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The path optimization method with machine learning is applied to the one-dimensional massive lattice Thirring model, which has the sign problem caused by the fermion determinant. This study aims to investigate how the path optimization method works for the sign problem. We show that the path optimization method successfully reduces statistical errors and reproduces the analytic results. We also examine an approximation of the Jacobian calculation in the learning process and show that it gives consistent results with those without an approximation.</description>

      <title>Unified and optimal frame choice for generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the internal three-dimensional quark and gluon structures of hadrons through generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from hard exclusive scattering processes is one of the most challenging tasks in nuclear and particle physics. In this paper, we introduce a new optimized reference frame that, for the first time, enables a unified view of all the reactions sensitive to GPDs and facilitates the interpretation of a variety of phase-space patterns that were previously hardly accessible and interpretable. Similarly to how the heliocentric description advanced our understanding of the solar system and gravitation, our new frame centers around a quasireal state, allows for a consistent separation of physical scales, and reveals a novel quantum interference mechanism.</description>
