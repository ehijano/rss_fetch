      <title>Muon trident process at far-forward LHC detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic production of a dilepton pair in the muon - ion scattering, usually denoted muon trident process, is investigated considering the feasibility of studying processes induced by muons at LHC using its far-forward detectors. The total and differential cross - sections are estimated taking into account of the Bethe-Heitler and bremsstrahlung channels, and predictions for the event rates expected for muon - tungsten ($\mu W$) collisions at the LHC energies are presented. Our results indicate that the observation of the muon trident process is feasible at FASER$\nu$. In particular, our results indicate that the electromagnetic production of $\tau^+ \tau^-$ pairs in the $\mu W$ scattering can, in principle, be observed for the first time ever at the LHC. In addition, we present our predictions for the production of QED bound states. Finally, results for the trident process at the FASER$\nu$2 detector are also presented.</description>

      <title>Axion Production and Detection Using a Dual NMR-type Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions that couple to nuclear spins via the axial current interaction can be both produced and detected using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. In this scheme, nuclei driven by a real oscillating magnetic field in one device act as an axion source, which can drive NMR in a nearby spin-polarized sample interrogated with a sensitive magnetometer. We study the prospects for detecting axions through this method and identify two key characteristics that result in compelling detection sensitivity. First, the gradient of the generated axion field can be substantial, set by the inverse distance from the source. In the near zone, it reduces to the inverse of the source's geometric size. Second, because the generated axion field is produced at a known frequency, the detection medium can be tuned precisely to this frequency, enabling long interrogation times. We show that the experimental sensitivity of a pair of centimeter-scale NMR devices operating over a 15-day integration time can already surpass existing astrophysical bounds on the axion-nucleon coupling. A similar sensitivity can be achieved with 10 centimeter-scale NMR devices with only 1 hour of integration time. These dual NMR configurations are capable of probing a wide range of axion masses, up to values comparable to the inverse distance between the source and the sensor.</description>

      <title>Unified Resummation of Soft Gluon Radiation in Heavy Meson Pair Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified resummation framework for heavy-meson pair photoproduction that treats soft-gluon radiation in a massive scheme for $|\boldsymbol q| \lesssim m_Q$ and is consistent with the massless limit $m_Q \ll |\boldsymbol q|$, where $\boldsymbol q$ denotes the transverse momentum of the pair and $m_Q$ the quark mass. This framework describes the full correlation regime $|\boldsymbol q| \ll |\boldsymbol P|$, with $\boldsymbol P$ the pair's relative transverse momentum. Next, within the Color Glass Condensate framework, we quantify the impact of soft gluon radiation on two important phenomenological observables, namely, the azimuthal $\Delta\phi$ correlation and the harmonic asymmetries $\langle \cos(2n\phi_{qP})\rangle$. Our results show that the resummation provides an excellent description of the H1 $\Delta\phi$ data. We then find that the angular-asymmetry harmonics are sizable and their ratios in $\gamma A$ to $\gamma p$ collisions are highly sensitive to gluon saturation. We further find a clear mass hierarchy in both observables, indicating that heavy-quark masses suppress soft radiation and thereby enhance genuine small-$x$ saturation signals. Our work demonstrates that heavy-quark pair photoproduction provides a quantitative probe of gluon saturation, directly measurable in forthcoming EIC and UPC measurements. Finally, the unified resummation is readily extendable to other processes involving massive particles and jets in both $eA$ and $pA$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Clearing up the Strong $CP$ problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) constrains the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) theta angle to be less than one part in ten billion, posing the Strong $CP$ problem. We revisit two classes of proposed solutions. First, we show that when $P$ or $CP$ is realized as a gauged discrete symmetry - as can arise in quantum gravity - the vacuum necessarily preserves $CP$, contrary to recent claims that discrete-symmetry solutions fail. Gauged discrete models face model-building challenges, such as avoiding contributions to the neutron EDM after spontaneous $P$ or $CP$ breaking, but in principle have no fundamental obstructions. Second, we critically examine recent arguments that the Strong $CP$ problem is illusory, demonstrating that a nonzero neutron EDM at finite $\bar\theta$ follows directly from well-understood QCD dynamics. Taken together, our results reinforce the reality of the Strong $CP$ problem and highlight gauged discrete-symmetry realizations of $P$ or $CP$ as plausible solutions.</description>

      <title>The $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ decay as a search for the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinterpret the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ measurement as a probe of the decay $B^+ \to K^+ a$, where $a$ denotes an axion or axion-like particle. This is possible in the kinematic regions where the di-neutrino invariant mass squared, $q^2$, can be identified with the assumed $m_a^2$. While $q^2$ is reconstructed only in the Hadronic Tag Analysis (HTA), it is not directly accessible in the Inclusive Tag Analysis (ITA), which provides much larger statistics and hence higher sensitivity. In ITA, $q^2$ is proxied by a reconstructed variable, $q^2_{\text{rec}}$, usually modeled through Belle II simulations. We show that the mapping between $q^2$ and $q^2_{\text{rec}}$ can be accurately derived from kinematic arguments alone -- without relying on internal experimental inputs. Using this relation and publicly available efficiencies, we obtain the strongest existing bounds on the coupling-rescaled Peccei-Quinn scale, $|(F_V)_{sb}| \ge 0.9 \times 10^9$ GeV, improving the latest bound in the literature by an order of magnitude. We further show that the bound depends only marginally on the assumed value of the di-neutrino signal strength $\mu_{\nu{\bar\nu}}$, whether fixed or floated. This establishes $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ as a double probe -- of new short-distance physics in the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar\nu$ amplitude, and of new light, elusive particles produced via $B^+ \to K^+ a$ -- the two probes working independently to an excellent approximation.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity forecasts for gravitational-wave detectors to dark matter decaying into gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures. In this work, we present model-independent predictions for the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from the decay of ultralight dark matter into gravitons. Within this framework, we forecast the sensitivity reach of current and forthcoming gravitational-wave detectors to such signals.</description>

      <title>A beginner's guide to functional methods in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional methods like Dyson-Schwinger equations, the nPI effective action formalism, bound state equations and the functional renormalization group are versatile tools to study quantum field theories. They are exact, nonperturbative equations but have to be truncated for practical calculations. After a general introduction, I focus on their use in particle physics and discuss common truncations and solution techniques. The complete process from choosing a truncation to calculating observable quantities is exemplified by means of the glueball spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Generalised Casas-Ibarra Parametrisation for Majorana Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple and broadly applicable extension of the Casas-Ibarra parametrisation that captures the structure of all Majorana neutrino mass models. Building directly on the original formulation, our approach naturally accommodates additional degrees of freedom and provides a unified, minimal framework for parametrising the Yukawa sector. It significantly simplifies both analytical treatments and numerical scans, and can be universally applied to any Majorana neutrino mass model, regardless of the underlying dynamics. The approach also offers a unified framework for classifying neutrino mass models according to the structure of the neutrino mass matrix, which naturally motivates the proposal of an extended version of the Scotogenic Model. This classification scheme yields tree-level (loop-level) representative models: the seesaw (Scotogenic Model), the linear seesaw (the Generalised Scotogenic Model), and the linear plus inverse seesaw (the Extended Scotogenic Model). We provide ready-to-use explicit expressions for several well-known scenarios, including the Zee model where one of the Yukawa matrices is antisymmetric.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in and Freeze-out in Right-Handed Neutrino Extended MSSM with Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of saturating the relic density bound with light higgsinos. When the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is extended with right-handed neutrino superfields and the seesaw scale is very low, right-handed sneutrinos can be produced via the freeze-in mechanism. In such a case we can have essentially two independent sources for dark matter, the traditional freeze-out of higgsinos and the freeze-in of right-handed sneutrinos. The heavier of these two will decay to the lighter species with a delay. We rule out such a scenario for all seesaw models as the lifetime of sterile neutrinos, produced over-abundantly via Dodelson-Widrow mechanism, exceeds the age of the universe and will contribute to the relic density.</description>

      <title>Spurion Analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_M/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Non-Invertible Selection Rules: Low-Order versus All-Order Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the spurion analysis of non-invertible selection rules (NISRs) arising from near-group fusion algebras, we further generalize the framework to a class of NISRs obtained from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifolding of a $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetry, denoted as $\mathbb{Z}_M/\mathbb{Z}_2$. Many structural features are carried over: for instance, our labeling scheme enables systematic tracking of all couplings when constructing composite amplitudes from simpler building blocks at arbitrary loop orders in perturbation theory. Our analysis provides a transparent understanding of both low-order and all-order zeros of couplings under radiative corrections. Furthermore, we examine the fate of low-order zeros when the fusion algebra is not faithfully realized -- a situation not captured by the vanilla argument of ``loop-induced groupification'' -- and formulate a conjecture on the related aspects of particle decoupling and effective theory. Finally, we discuss the low-order versus all-order zeros in Yukawa textures from the perspective of spurion analysis.</description>

      <title>Stellar cooling limits on KK gravitons and dark dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit cooling bounds on light Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, as arise in the dark dimension scenario, considering red giants, neutron stars, and supernovae. In addition to bremsstrahlung, we account for two novel production channels: resonant mixing with the in-medium photon and a pion-induced process in supernovae. The strongest limits arise from SN 1987A, with the emissivity from the pion process exceeding that from bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few. Given present uncertainties, we obtain a bound on the KK mass scale of $m_{\rm KK}\gtrsim 0.6\,{\rm eV}$ $(\gtrsim 500\,{\rm eV})$ for 2 (3) extra dimensions. Improved understanding of the properties of pions in supernovae could strengthen these limits to roughly ${\rm eV}$ $({\rm keV})$. For 1 extra dimension, the bounds are weaker than those from laboratory searches. We also show that constraints from KK graviton decays to Standard Model particles are less stringent than the cooling bounds if there is KK number violation at the level typically assumed in the dark dimension scenario, although these bounds could be strengthened by future observations.</description>

Abstract: The forward neutrino program at the Large Hadron Collider has entered the era of providing the first measurements and observations. As it has notable connections to astrophysics and will complement the results and projections of key measurements at the LHC and other measurements, it is becoming increasingly important for collider physicists to recognize and utilize the unique potential of this novel research direction. The present work reviews a selection of questions related to the nature, masses and interactions of neutrinos, and highlights some of the recent projections for the LHC Run 3 as well as the high-luminosity run.</description>

      <title>Charge distribution of the gauge-mediation type Q ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the formation of the gauge-mediation type Q balls in the logarithmic square potential on three-dimensional lattices. We obtain the broad charge distribution of the Q ball of this type for the first time. The charge of the Q ball at the peak of the distribution is smaller than what we estimated as the average of the largest tens of the Q balls in the logarithmic potential for the same initial amplitude of the field at the onset of its oscillation. We also discuss some impacts of the broad distribution on cosmology and astrophysics. In the B ball (Q being the baryon number) case, the broad distribution would lead to the coexistence of both stable and unstable B balls. We find that stable B balls can account for the dark matter of the universe without affecting successful big bang nucleosynthesis by the decay of the unstable B balls, but the baryon number of the universe cannot be explained by them. On the other hand, the large L balls (Q being the lepton number) would be the dark matter as well while avoiding the constraints on the X and/or gamma rays from the decay of the smaller L balls.</description>

      <title>Pion-Kaon femtoscopy as a probe of the space-time emission anisotropies due to interactions at the hadronic stage of matter evolution in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission asymmetries between pions and kaons reflect the role of the hadronic phase in the cooling of a droplet of deconfined strongly-interacting matter. This study compares results from two models at the same collision energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV to investigate how interactions in the hadronic phase affect particle emission. The first model, iHKM, provides a complete description of all stages of the evolution; from the initial scattering and thermalization to the final hadronic state, while the second model, LQTH (LHYQUID+THERMINATOR2), assumes a sudden conversion into hadrons, neglecting further interactions. To increase the sensitivity to hadronic interactions, the analysis was performed as a function of the pair transverse velocity for pairs with nearly equal velocity vectors. The obtained predictions are compared with previously measured ALICE data at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV as a function of the cube root of the average particle multiplicity density at midrapidity, showing that both radii and emission asymmetries scale with particle multiplicity, regardless of the collision energy. The iHKM model reproduces the measured trends both qualitatively and quantitatively, whereas the LQTH model requires additional parameters-in particular, a time delay in the emission of kaons-to achieve quantitative agreement. The comparative analysis also indicates a possible non-monotonic behavior of the asymmetry as a function of transverse velocity, and a constant scaling of the ratio between the emission asymmetry and femtoscopic radii with particle multiplicity. These results highlight the importance of including interactions in the hadronic stage for a complete description of the emission function.</description>

      <title>Probing the QGP through $p_T$-differential radial flow of heavy quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $p_T$-differential radial flow $v_0(p_T)$ in the heavy-quark sector. Within an event-by-event Langevin framework, we show that this observable exhibits a strong sensitivity to the heavy quark-bulk interaction. It provides a powerful and novel tool to constrain the transport coefficients of heavy quarks in the QGP and, more generally, to assess the strength of the interaction of a Brownian particle in an expanding bulk medium. The results further indicate that heavy quarks exhibit collective behavior driven by the isotropic expansion of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions and, at low $p_T$, it offers a marked signature of the heavy quark hadronization mechanism.</description>

      <title>Coherent and incoherent antineutrino scattering on stable even-even isotopes of molybdenum detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observations of the coherent neutrino- and antineutrino-nucleus scattering have opened up a plethora of opportunities to probe physics within standard and non-standard theories of the electroweak interactions. In the present article, our goal is to explore the possibility of using the molybdenum material as detection medium for coherent and incoherent antineutrino- and neutrino- Mo scattering in the ongoing and future coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE{\nu}NS) exper- iments by using relevant (anti-)neutrino beams as e.g. stopped pion-decay neutrino beams, reactor antineutrino beams, astrophysical (solar or supernova) (anti)neutrino beams, etc. Our present co- herent and incoherent scattering cross sections of Mo isotopes with neutrinos and antineutrinos are based on the deformed shell model (DSM) that has been previously employed for studying similar processes. On the other hand, in the past, CE{\nu}NS events obtained with this model provided us with better fits to COHERENT experimental data compared to phenomenological form factors.</description>

      <title>Study of the scalar and pseudoscalar meson mass spectrum above the QCD chiral phase transition, using an effective Lagrangian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, expanding on previous analyses, we employ an effective Lagrangian approach to investigate the mass spectrum of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperature, above the (pseudo-)critical temperature $T_c$, in a "realistic" $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavor scenario with degenerate $up$ and $down$ quarks and a heavier $strange$ quark: $0 &lt; m_u = m_d \ll m_s$. The model's predictions are then critically compared with available lattice QCD results (where meson screening masses are extracted from chiral susceptibilities, which correspond to two-point correlation functions of suitable interpolating operators), looking, in particular, for signatures of the breaking of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry above $T_c$.</description>

      <title>The strong coupling from the IR to the UV extremes: Determination of $\alpha_s$ and prospects from EIC and JLab at 22 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how the Bjorken sum rule allows access to the QCD running coupling $\alpha_s$ at any scale, including in the deep infrared IR domain. The Bjorken sum data from Jefferson Lab, together with the world data on $\alpha_s$ reported by the Particle Data Group, allow us to determine the running of $\alpha_s(Q)$ over five orders of magnitude in four-momentum $Q$. We present two possible future measurements of the running of $\alpha_s(Q)$ using the Bjorken sum rule: the first at the EIC, covering the range $1.5 &lt; Q &lt; 8.7$ GeV, and the second at Jefferson Lab at 22 GeV, covering the range $1.0 &lt; Q &lt; 4.7$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the 650 GeV and 95 GeV Higgs Anomalies in the N2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental hints from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in di-photon and partially in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states suggest the possible existence of an additional Higgs boson with a mass around 95 GeV. Interestingly, these observations are consistent with earlier results from the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider, which pointed to an excess in $b\bar b$ final states within a similar mass range. Additionally, CMS has observed an excess in the $\gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$ final state, indicating a possible resonance near 650 GeV decaying into a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons or into a SM-like Higgs boson accompanied by a lighter scalar with mass near 95 GeV. In this work, we investigate whether these anomalies can be simultaneously explained within the Next-to-2-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM), an extension of the Standard Model (SM) scalar sector featuring two complex Higgs doublets and an additional real singlet. Assuming the existence of a CP-even Higgs state compatible with the 95 GeV excesses (restricted to the $\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar b$ channels), we analyse the Type-II and Type-Y Yukawa structures, taking the observed 650 GeV resonance to be a CP-even Higgs state. An extensive parameter scan is performed, incorporating the latest constraints. Our results show that a heavy CP-even Higgs resonance around 650 GeV, produced predominantly via gluon-gluon fusion and subsequently decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs boson together with another scalar at approximately 95 GeV, can be simultaneously accommodated within both the N2HDM Type-II and Type-Y frameworks at a significance level of 2$\sigma$. This interpretation leads to distinctive and testable predictions from the N2HDM for the ongoing LHC Run-3 and the forthcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) phase.</description>

      <title>A graphical representation of gluonic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite local operators are central to effective field theories (EFTs), as they define interaction vertices in effective Lagrangians and play a fundamental role in investigating the structure of quantum field theories. The contribution of high-dimensional operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) grows increasingly important as experimental precision improves at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in future colliders. However, the number of operators increases very rapidly with dimension, making it extremely challenging to identify their complete set. In our previous work \cite{Jin:2020pwh}, we proposed a systematic method for generating gluonic operators using primitive operators. In this paper, we introduce a graphical representation of gluonic operators and, based on this representation, present a method to systematically construct primitive operators. Using this method, we derive primitive operators corresponding to gluonic operators of length 2 to length 7 in $D$-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Can we ignore the time dependence in matter neutrino resonance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading to matter neutrino resonance (MNR). MNR is one of the most interesting mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor field evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Standard Model equation of state and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes all known fundamental particles and their interactions; however, it leaves several unanswered questions. Theories beyond the Standard Model typically introduce new particles and symmetries to address these issues. In the early universe, when such particles become non-relativistic, or the symmetries are broken, there are associated reductions in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. These reductions lead to an exponential enhancement in the formation rate of primordial black holes. In this paper, we calculate the equation of state for several supersymmetric and composite Higgs models, which naturally predict a large number of additional degrees of freedom. Using these equations of state, we compute some example primordial black hole abundances, which we find can be enhanced by up to 20 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Engineering the shapes of quark-gluon plasma droplets by comparing anisotropic flow in small symmetric and asymmetric collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of collective flow phenomena in small collision systems challenges our understanding of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation and evolution. This complexity lies in the initial geometries, which are influenced by both nucleon configuration and subnucleonic fluctuations, introducing uncertainties in interpreting flow patterns. We disentangle these contributions through comparative measurements of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow in asymmetric $d$+Au and symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, which produce medium of comparable sizes but with vastly different initial geometries. The larger $v_2$ in $d$+Au reflects its dominant elliptic geometry, while the similar $v_3$ in both systems is better explained by considering subnucleonic fluctuations. These contrasting flow patterns are quantitatively described by a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model tuned to large-system Au+Au data, indicating efficient transformation of initial geometries to final-state anisotropies. These results provide evidence for droplet formation in small systems with transport properties that are similar to those observed in large collision systems, consistent with QGP-like behavior.</description>

      <title>Open $B$-hadron production at hadron colliders in QCD at next-to-next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a calculation of open heavy-flavor production at hadron colliders which extends to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy the classic NLO-accurate formalism developed almost 30 years ago under the acronym FONLL. The approach retains the exact heavy-flavor mass dependence at low transverse momentum, $p_T$, and resums collinear logarithms through next-to-next-to-leading log (NNLL) at high $p_T$. Provided are predictions for $B$-hadrons as well as $B$-decay products like $J/\Psi$ and muons. The main features of the NNLO+NNLL results are reduced scale dependence and moderate NNLO correction, consistent with perturbative convergence in a wide range of kinematic scales from few GeV up to asymptotically large values of $p_T$. The new calculation significantly improves the agreement with data for $B$-hadrons and muons. We uncover an intriguing discrepancy in $J/\Psi$ final states which may point to a lower value of the $B\to J/\Psi$ decay rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clocks based on nuclear isomer transitions promise exceptional stability and precision. The low transition energy of the thorium-229 isomer makes it an ideal candidate, as it has been excited by a vacuum-ultraviolet laser and is highly sensitive to subtle interactions. This enables the development of powerful tools for probing new forces, which we call {\it quintessometers}. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of nuclear clocks, particularly solid-state variants, to surpass existing limits on scalar field couplings, exceeding the sensitivity of current fifth-force searches at submicron distances and significantly improving equivalence-principle tests at kilometer scales and beyond. Additionally, we highlight the capability of transportable nuclear clocks to detect scalar interactions at distances beyond $10\,$km, complementing space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Identified Hadron Production at Hadron Colliders in Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to identified hadron production at hadron colliders. The inclusion of the NNLO correction has an important impact on all observables considered in this work. Higher order corrections reduce scale uncertainty and in almost all cases are moderate. Overall, good perturbative convergence is observed across kinematics and observables. The uncertainty due to missing higher orders is relatively small and, in many cases, smaller than the experimental uncertainty. The largest source of theoretical uncertainty at present is from the knowledge of the non-perturbative parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FF), which dwarfs the scale uncertainty in most kinematic ranges. The inclusion of NNLO corrections demonstrates the precision studies potential of this class of observables. To fully realize this potential, however, a new generation of improved fragmentation functions may be needed. The results of the present work will enable global fits of FF with NNLO precision.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Origin of the KM3-230213A event and associated Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological scenario to explain the exceptional KM3-230213A neutrino event reported at an energy scale of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~PeV by the KM3NeT collaboration, along with its associated gravitational wave (GW) signatures. In our framework, ultra high energy neutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced via the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early Universe. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate that while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as required by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly feeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a neutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario predicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during PBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of the sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger probe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling explanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating the interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the doubly bottom $H_{(s)}\bar{T}_{(s)}$ and $H_{(s)}T_{(s)}$ systems by adopting the one-boson-exchange model, where $H_{(s)}$ and $T_{(s)}$ represent $S$-wave $B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ and $P$-wave $B^{(*)}_{(s)1,2}$ doublets, respectively. For the $H\bar{T}$ systems, we predict some loosely bound states in the $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{-\pm})$ $B\bar{B}_{1}$, $I(J^{PC})=0(2^{-\pm})$ $B\bar{B}_{2}^{*}$, $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{-\pm})$ $B^*\bar{B}_{1}$ and $I(J^{PC})=0(2^{-\pm})$ $B^*\bar{B}_{2}^{*}$ channels, which are the most promising hidden bottom molecular tetraquarks. For the $HT$ systems, the $B^*B_1$ channels with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^{-}), 0(2^{-})$ and the $B^*B_2^*$ channels with $I(J^P) = 0(2^{-})$ are also likely candidates for forming molecular tetraquarks. In contrast, no molecular candidates have been identified in the bottom-strange sectors. One can hope that our predictions will provide valuable insights to the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations as they continue to explore this fascinating field through experimental research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the entanglement observed in top-antitop quark spin states at the LHC is local in the energy region close to the production threshold. In contrast, nonlocal entanglement is observed in the central boosted region defined by a top-quark pair invariant mass $m_{t\bar t} &gt; 800$ GeV and scattering angles $\Theta$ satisfying $|\cos \Theta |&lt;0.2$. This makes top-quark pairs a unique laboratory for studying the interplay between entanglement and Bell locality. The locality of entanglement near the production threshold is further supported by a recent CMS analysis, which reports a significance of more than $5\sigma$. We also demonstrate that there exists a kinematic region where the spin states of the top-antitop quark are separable, yet they exhibit non-zero discord and magic.</description>

      <title>CP-violation in production of heavy neutrinos from bubble collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First order phase transitions (FOPT) in the early Universe can be powerful emitters of both relativistic and heavy particles, upon the collision of ultra-relativistic bubble shells. If the particles coupling to the bubble wall have CP-violating interactions, the same collision process can also create a local lepton or baryon charge. This CP-violation can originate from different channels, which have only been partially addressed in the literature. We present a systematic analysis of the different channels inducing CP-violation during bubble collisions: 1) the decay of heavy particles 2) the production of heavy particles and 3) the production of light and relativistic Standard Model (SM) particles.
  As an illustration of the impact that such mechanisms can have on baryon number and dark matter (DM) abundance, we then introduce a simple model of cogenesis, separating a positive and a negative lepton number in the SM and a dark sector (DS). The lepton number asymmetry in the SM can be used to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), while the opposite asymmetry in the DS is responsible for determining the abundance of DM. Moreover, the masses of light neutrinos can be understood via the inverse seesaw mechanism, with the lepton-violating Majorana mass originating from the FOPT.
  A typical signal produced by a FOPT is the irreducible gravitational wave (GW) background. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space can be probed at future observatories like the Einstein Telescope (ET).</description>

      <title>Naturally resonant two-mediator model of self-interacting dark matter with decoupled relic abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal, fully thermal mechanism that resolves the long-standing tension between achieving the observed dark-matter relic abundance and explaining the astrophysical signatures of self-interactions. The framework introduces two mediators: a light scalar $\phi$ (MeV scale) that yields the required, velocity-dependent self-interactions, and a heavy scalar resonance $\Phi_h$ (TeV scale) with mass $m_{\Phi_h}\!\approx\!2m_\chi$ that opens an $s$-channel resonant annihilation during freeze-out. This clearly decouples early-universe annihilation from late-time halo dynamics. A detailed numerical analysis identified a narrow predictive island of viability. A representative benchmark with $m_\chi\!=\!600$~GeV, $m_\phi\!=\!15$~MeV, and $m_{\Phi_h}\!\simeq\!1.2$~TeV reproduces the relic density and yields $\sigma_T/m_\chi\sim 0.1$--$1~\mathrm{cm}^2\!/\mathrm{g}$ at dwarf-galaxy velocities while satisfying cluster bounds. The model makes sharp, testable predictions: a narrow $t\bar t$ resonance near $1.2$~TeV within HL-LHC reach, and a spin-independent direct-detection signal $\sigma_{\rm SI}\!\sim\!7\times10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$ within next-generation sensitivity. As an optional UV completion, we show that walking $\mathrm{SU}(3)_H$ gauge theory with $N_f=10$ naturally realizes the near-threshold relation $m_{\Phi_h}\!\approx\!2m_\chi$ and can furnish an effective anomalous dimension $\gamma\!\approx\!0.5$ which underlies a density-responsive dark-energy sector, suggesting a unified origin for the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Impact of one-loop corrections to trilinear scalar couplings on di-Higgs production in the RxSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate di-Higgs production at the (HL-)LHC and possible high-energy future $e^+e^-$ colliders within the real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM), the RxSM. This model has two CP-even Higgs bosons, $h$ and $H$, for which we assume $m_h\sim 125 \text{ GeV} &lt; m_H$. We analyse the effect of one-loop corrections to the two trilinear scalar couplings relevant for di-Higgs production, $\lambda_{hhh}$ and $\lambda_{hhH}$, by performing an extensive parameter scan within the RxSM. We find that the one-loop corrections have a strong impact on the total production cross-sections, as well as on the differential cross-sections with respect to the invariant di-Higgs mass, $m_{hh}$. We evaluate the sensitivity of the HL-LHC and a high-energy $e^+e^-$ collider with $\sqrt{s} = 1 \text{ TeV}$, the ILC1000, to probe BSM physics effects in these processes. We demonstrate that the RxSM can be distinguished from the SM for large parts of the sampled parameter space. The resonant $H$ structure in the $m_{hh}$ distribution, on the other hand, can be observed only if the corresponding couplings, in particular $\lambda_{hhH}$, are sufficiently large. Here the ILC1000 yields a substantially better sensitivity than the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Improving Sensitivity of Vector-like Top Partner Searches with Jet Substructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector-like quark partners appear in many BSM models and remain an important area of research, as they can offer insights into the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. In this work, we have focused on studying the production of a heavy vector-like top partner in association with a SM top quark via chromomagnetic coupling and the four decay modes of the top partner, namely, $bW$, $tZ$, $th$, and $tg$. The signal has been studied in final states with one fat jet, at least one $b$-tagged jet, one lepton, and missing energy. This study focuses on the extensive use of jet substructure techniques in jets clustered with fixed and dynamically varying radius to deal with events containing differently sized jets. Important kinematic information, along with jet substructure and event shape observables, has been used in a multivariate analysis to extract signal with high significance. A comparative study between fixed and dynamically varying radius clustering of jets is also presented, leading to an improvement in signal sensitivity in the highly boosted scenario.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule study of the tensor $\Delta^0\Delta^0$ dibaryon state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exotic $\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}$ dibaryon state with quantum numbers $J^{P} = 2^{+}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. A tensor interpolating current is constructed to determine the mass and residue of this state, including explicit calculations of contributions from quark, gluon, and mixed vacuum condensates up to dimension nine. The numerical analysis yields a mass of $m_{\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}} = 2426^{+101}_{-108}~\mathrm{MeV}$ and a residue of $f_{\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}} = \left( 2.30^{+0.49}_{-0.45} \right) \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{GeV}^{8}$. The predicted mass lies about $38~\mathrm{MeV}$ below the $2m_{\Delta^{0}}$ threshold, which indicates the possible existence of a bound molecular configuration. Consequently, the tensor $\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}$ dibaryon may serve as a promising candidate for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Strings in $E_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the appearance of superconducting strings in $E_6$ grand unification, keeping track of the magnetic monopole flux that precedes the formation of the string flux tube. This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields. The fields in the spinorial representation of SO(10) acquire a phase change of $\exp(\pm i\pi)$ if taken around the topologically stable $Z_2$ string.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality, providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations. Our findings provide deeper insights into the boundaries of classical and quantum theories in three-particle systems, advancing the understanding of non-locality in particle decays and its relevance to particle physics and quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>A Model of Realistic Flavor Symmetry: Origin of Fermion Mass, Flavor Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I proposed a unified model of particle physic and cosmology in \cite {1}, which can simultaneously account for these origin of the inflation, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino mass and baryon asymmetry. I here focus on the fermion flavor issues in the unified model, which were not addressed previously. I introduce a realistic flavor symmetry to generate the fermion mass and mixing, from which we naturally derive the relationship between the quark mixing and the lepton mixing, and reveal the source of the difference between them. In particular, I derive a neutrino mass matrix which has a special structure form and only contains four parameters, but its numerical solutions are exactly accurately fitting to all the measured data of the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton mixing, and finely predict $m_{\nu_{2}}=0.01037$ eV. In addition, I discuss a new scenario of the leptogenesis in the model, which arises from two CP-asymmetric decays of a super-heavy neutral Dirac fermion, its CP asymmetry is closely related to the neutrino mass and mixing, via which we can correctly predict the baryon asymmetry. Lastly, I give several approaches to test the model. In short, the model can simply and elegantly account for the fermion flavor issues and the baryon asymmetry, and it has realistic and testable significance, therefore we expect the ongoing and future experiments to test the model.</description>

      <title>Search for high energy 5.5 MeV solar axions with the complete Borexino dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A search for solar axions and axion-like particles produced in the $p+d\rightarrow\rm{^3He}+A~(5.5\rm{ ~MeV})$ reaction was performed using the complete dataset of the Borexino detector (3995 days of measurement live-time). The following interaction processes have been considered: axion decay into two photons $({\rm A}\rightarrow2\gamma)$, inverse Primakoff conversion on nuclei $({\rm A}+Z\rightarrow\gamma+Z$), the Compton conversion of axions to photons $({\rm A}+e\rightarrow e+\gamma)$ and the axio-electric effect $({\rm A}+e+Z\rightarrow e+Z$). Model-independent limits on axion-photon ($g_{A\gamma}$), axion-electron ($g_{Ae}$), and isovector axion-nucleon ($g_{3AN}$) couplings are obtained: $|g_{A\gamma}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 2.3\times 10^{-11} \rm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $|g_{Ae}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 1.9\times 10^{-13}$ at $m_A &lt;$ 1 MeV (90\% c.l.). The Borexino results exclude new large regions of $g_{A\gamma}$, and $g_{Ae}$ coupling constants and axion masses $m_A$, and leads to constraints on the products $|g_{A\gamma}\times m_A|$ and $|g_{Ae}\times m_A|$ for the KSVZ- and the DFSZ-axion models.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Benchmark of Proton Helicity and Flavor-Dependent Unpolarized TMDPDFs at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculations of the isovector helicity transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) and the flavor-dependent unpolarized TMDPDFs for up and down quarks in the proton. Our computations utilize domain-wall fermion discretization with physical quark masses. Employing Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlation functions within the large-momentum effective theory framework, we access nonperturbative transverse quark separations $b_T$ up to approximately 1 fm, corresponding to transverse momenta as low as 200 MeV. Based on the quasi-TMD factorization theorem, we construct renormalization-group-invariant ratios that are equal to the corresponding light-cone TMDPDF ratios. At moderate $x$, our results reveal that the isovector helicity and unpolarized TMDPDFs exhibit nearly identical transverse structure up to a normalization factor, and the unpolarized distributions display only mild flavor dependence. These findings not only support key trends observed in recent global analyses but also provide robust, nonperturbative constraints that can distinguish between different parameterizations. This work establishes a first-principles benchmark for TMDPDFs, offering valuable input for ongoing and future experimental efforts to map the proton's three-dimensional structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely. Possible exceptions resulting from the dynamics of the nearby $I=\frac{1}{2}$ $J=({\frac{1}{2}})^-$ nucleon resonance $N^{\ast}$(1895) are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Symmetric-asymmetric collision comparison: disentangling nuclear structure and subnucleonic structure effects for small system flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous flow measurements in small collision systems were mostly based on highly asymmetric collisions ($p$+Pb, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, $^{3}$He+Au), where both nuclear structure and subnucleonic fluctuations are important. Comparing these asymmetric systems with the newly available symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at RHIC and LHC provides a unique opportunity to disentangle these two contributions. Using Glauber models incorporating both nucleon and quark-level substructure, we analyze multiplicity distributions and initial-state estimators: eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ for anisotropic flow $v_n$ and inverse transverse size $d_{\perp}$ for radial flow. We find that subnucleonic fluctuations impact O+O collisions differently from asymmetric systems, creating specific patterns in flow observables that enable disentangling the competing contributions. Such experimental comparisons will reduce uncertainties in the initial conditions and improve our understanding of the properties of the QGP-like medium produced in small systems.</description>

Abstract: It is well understood that subnuclear fluctuations in the initial state of heavy-ion collisions have an important impact on the creation of long-range correlations in the transverse plane. This is also true for the creation of particle correlations along the beam direction, which can be measured in particle detectors, e.g. through longitudinal decorrelation observables. In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity structures in Pb+Pb collisions using a hybrid model connecting the 3D resolved {\Dipper} initial state model to a (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamics framework CLVisc. We include different sources of fluctuations at the (sub-)nucleon level and present the effects of their inclusion on the longitudinal structure of relevant observables, focusing in this proceedings paper on charged hadron multiplicities, baryon stopping, directed flow and flow decorrelation. We find remarkable agreement to the experimental data regarding directed flow and the rapidity resolved charge particle multiplicity.</description>
