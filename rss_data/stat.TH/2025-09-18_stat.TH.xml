      <title>A Scalable Formula for the Moments of a Family of Self-Normalized Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the student t-statistic, normalization has been a widely used method in statistic and other disciplines including economics, ecology and machine learning. We focus on statistics taking the form of a ratio over (some power of) the sample mean, the probabilistic features of which remain unknown. We develop a unified formula for the moments of these self-normalized statistics with non-negative observations, yielding closed-form expressions for several important cases. Moreover, the complexity of our formula doesn't scale with the sample size $n$. Our theoretical findings, supported by extensive numerical experiments, reveal novel insights into their bias and variance, and we propose a debiasing method illustrated with applications such as the odds ratio, Gini coefficient and squared coefficient of variation.</description>

      <title>Consistent causal discovery with equal error variances: a least-squares perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the true causal structure among a set of variables, generated by a linear acyclic structural equation model (SEM) with the error terms being independent and having equal variances. It is well-known that the true underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) encoding the causal structure is uniquely identifiable under this assumption. In this work, we establish that the sum of minimum expected squared errors for every variable, while predicted by the best linear combination of its parent variables, is minimised if and only if the causal structure is represented by any supergraph of the true DAG. This property is further utilised to design a Bayesian DAG selection method that recovers the true graph consistently.</description>

      <title>Variational Gaussian Approximation in Replica Analysis of Parametric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the replica method for analyzing inference and learning in parametric models, considering situations where the data-generating distribution is unknown or analytically intractable. Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible.</description>

      <title>Rate doubly robust estimation for weighted average treatment effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weighted average treatment effect (WATE) defines a versatile class of causal estimands for populations characterized by propensity score weights, including the average treatment effect (ATE), treatment effect on the treated (ATT), on controls (ATC), and for the overlap population (ATO). WATE has broad applicability in social and medical research, as many datasets from these fields align with its framework. However, the literature lacks a systematic investigation into the robustness and efficiency conditions for WATE estimation. Although doubly robust (DR) estimators are well-studied for ATE, their applicability to other WATEs remains uncertain. This paper investigates whether widely used WATEs admit DR or rate doubly robust (RDR) estimators and assesses the role of nuisance function accuracy, particularly with machine learning. Using semiparametric efficient influence function (EIF) theory and double/debiased machine learning (DML), we propose three RDR estimators under specific rate and regularity conditions and evaluate their performance via Monte Carlo simulations. Applications to NHANES data on smoking and blood lead levels, and SIPP data on 401(k) eligibility, demonstrate the methods' practical relevance in medical and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic and nonlinear compressive sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs and is freely available at https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs.
  We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive sensing.</description>

      <title>Differentially private multivariate medians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical tools which satisfy rigorous privacy guarantees are necessary for modern data analysis. It is well-known that robustness against contamination is linked to differential privacy. Despite this fact, using multivariate medians for differentially private and robust multivariate location estimation has not been systematically studied. We develop novel finite-sample performance guarantees for differentially private multivariate depth-based medians, which are essentially sharp. Our results cover commonly used depth functions, such as the halfspace (or Tukey) depth, spatial depth, and the integrated dual depth. We show that under Cauchy marginals, the cost of heavy-tailed location estimation outweighs the cost of privacy. We demonstrate our results numerically using a Gaussian contamination model in dimensions up to $d = 100$, and compare them to a state-of-the-art private mean estimation algorithm. As a by-product of our investigation, we prove concentration inequalities for the output of the exponential mechanism about the maximizer of the population objective function. This bound applies to objective functions that satisfy a mild regularity condition.</description>

      <title>Sharp Asymptotic Minimaxity for One-Group Priors in Sparse Normal Means Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the asymptotic properties of the Bayesian multiple testing rules when the mean parameter of the sparse normal means problem is modeled by a broad class of global-local priors, expressed as a scale mixture of normals. We are interested in studying the least possible risk, i.e., the minimax risk for two frequentist losses, one being the usual misclassification (or Hamming) loss, and the other one, measured as the sum of FDR and FNR. Under the betamin separation condition, at first, assuming the level of sparsity to be known, we propose a condition on the global parameter of our chosen class of priors, such that the resultant decision rule attains the minimax risk for both of the losses mentioned above. When the level of sparsity is unknown, we either use an estimate of the global parameter obtained from the data, or propose an absolutely continuous prior on it. For both of the procedures, under some assumption on the unknown level of sparsity, we show that the decision rules also attain the minimax risk, again for both of the losses. Our results also provide a guideline regarding the selection of priors, in the sense that beyond a subclass(horseshoe type priors) of our chosen class of priors, the minimax risk is not achievable with respect to any one of the two loss functions considered in this article. However, the subclass, horseshoe-type priors, is such a large subclass that it contains Horseshoe, Strawderman Berger, standard double Pareto, inverse gamma priors, just to name a few. In this way, along with the most popular BH procedure and approach using spike and slab prior, a multiple testing rule based on one group priors also achieves the optimal boundary. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results in the literature of global local priors which ensure the optimal minimax risk can be achieved exactly.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for Weakly Interacting Hypoelliptic Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parameter estimation for interacting particle systems (IPSs) consisting of $N$ weakly interacting multivariate hypoelliptic SDEs. We propose a locally Gaussian approximation of the transition dynamics, carefully designed to address the degenerate structure of the noise (diffusion matrix), thus leading to the formation of a well-defined full likelihood. Our approach permits carrying out statistical inference for a wide class of hypoelliptic IPSs that are not covered by recent works as the latter rely on the Euler-Maruyama scheme. We analyze a contrast estimator based on the developed likelihood with $n$ high-frequency particle observations over a fixed period $[0,T]$ and show its asymptotic normality as $n, N \to \infty$ with a requirement that the step-size $\Delta_n = T/n$ is such that $N\Delta_n\rightarrow 0$, assuming that all particle coordinates (e.g.~position and velocity) are observed. In practical situations where only partial observations (e.g. particle positions but not velocities) are available, the proposed locally Gaussian approximation offers greater flexibility for inference, when combined with established Bayesian techniques. In particular, unlike the Euler-Maruyama-based approaches, we do not have to impose restrictive structures on the hypoelliptic IPSs. We present numerical experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, both with complete and partial particle observations.</description>

Abstract: We consider ordinary least squares estimation and variations on least squares estimation such as penalized (regularized) least squares and spectral shrinkage estimates for problems with p &gt; n and associated problems with prediction of new observations. After the introduction of Section 1, Section 2 examines a number of commonly used estimators for p &gt; n. Section 3 introduces prediction with p &gt; n. Section 4 introduces notational changes to facilitate discussion of overfitting and Section 5 illustrates the phenomenon of double descent. We conclude with some final comments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two sharp, closed-form empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the idea of fiducial inference was put forward by Fisher, researchers have been attempting to place it within a rigorous and well motivated framework. It is fair to say that a general definition has remained elusive. In this paper we start with a representation of Bayesian posterior distributions provided by Doob that relies on martingales. This is explicit in defining how a true parameter value should depend on a random sample and hence an approach to "inverse probability" as originally conceived by Fisher. Taking this as our cue, we introduce a definition of fiducial inference that can be regarded as general.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyse multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed, including a consistent factor number estimator. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyse a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighbouring areas.</description>

      <title>System Reliability Estimation via Shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a coherent reliability system composed of multiple components configured according to a specific structure function, the distribution of system time to failure, or system lifetime, is often of primary interest. Accurate estimation of system reliability is critical in a wide range of engineering and industrial applications, forming decisions in system design, maintenance planning, and risk assessment. The system lifetime distribution can be estimated directly using the observed system failure times. However, when component-level lifetime data is available, it can yield improved estimates of system reliability. In this work, we demonstrate that under nonparametric assumptions about the component time-to-failure distributions, traditional estimators such as the Product-Limit Estimator (PLE) can be further improved under specific loss functions. We propose a novel methodology that enhances the nonparametric system reliability estimation through a shrinkage transformation applied to component-level estimators. This shrinkage approach leads to improved efficiency in estimating system reliability.</description>
