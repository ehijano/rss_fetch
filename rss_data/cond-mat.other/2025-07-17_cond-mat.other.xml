      <title>Separation of relaxation timescales via strong system-bath coupling: Dissipative three-level system as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically demonstrate that strong system-bath coupling separates the relaxation dynamics of a dissipative quantum system into two distinct regimes: a short-time dynamics that, as expected, accelerates with increasing coupling to the environment, and a slow dynamics that, counterintuitively, becomes increasingly prolonged at sufficiently strong coupling. Using the reaction-coordinate polaron-transform mapping, we uncover the general mechanism behind this effect and derive accurate expressions for both relaxation timescales. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions. From a practical perspective, our results suggest that strong coupling to a dissipative bath can autonomously generate and sustain long-lived quantum coherences, offering a promising strategy for bath-engineered quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of artificial magnetic fields: Ground state and thermal phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider effects of artificial magnetic fields on the ground state of the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Using an asymmetric Bose-Hubbard model, we demonstrate that the frustrating hopping energy localizes bosons and enlarges insulators and supersolid borders. We show these increments in the presence of artificial gauge fields up to a symmetric point of the field. Moreover, our calculations exhibit the real space modulations of the superfluid and supersolid phases. The bosonic current exhibits vortices in these phases, which their configurations depend on the commensuration between the magnetic field and the lattice. Although the magnetic field breaks the translational symmetry of the square lattice explicitly, this symmetry is restored in the Mott insulator phase. The filling factor exhibits a checkerboard pattern in the density-wave and supersolid phases, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We explore thermal fluctuations and demonstrate the robustness of insulators and SS phases up to temperatures comparable to the interaction energy, which support the feasibility of observing such phases in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate state-transfer in modular quantum computer architectures exploiting the ultrastrong coupling regime of interaction between quantum processing units and ICs. We show that protocols based on adiabatic coherent transport may achieve near-ideal single-letter quantum capacity and robustness against parametric fluctuations suppressing leakage induced by the dynamical Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Selective decoupling in multi-level quantum systems by the SU(2) sign anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical decoupling operated by $2\pi$-pulses in a two-level subspaces of a multilevel system showing that it may leads to selective decoupling. This provides a flexible strategy for decoupling transitions in a quantum network, when control to directly address them is not available which can be use to control internode interaction or actively suppress decoherence</description>

      <title>Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)] has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour, observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number, suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with high-order squeezing states.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic spin 3/2 nuclear quadrupole resonance: Spin relaxation and electric field gradient via Rabi frequency goniometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A straightforward way to determine the electric field gradient $-$ principal axes frame (EFG-PAF) on single crystal samples with spin 3/2 nuclei is demonstrated. Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy is used to determine the Rabi frequency for $^{35}$Cl in a single crystal of potassium chlorate (KClO$_3$) by comparing the NQR signal for powder and single crystal samples. By exploiting the geometrical dependence of the Rabi frequency with respect to the excitation direction, EFG-PAF is readily determined. Furthermore, relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$ were measured at multiple temperatures ranging from $17~\textrm{K}$ to $200 ~$K, extending the results of previous works to colder temperatures where new relaxation mechanisms become dominant. The experiments were performed in a cryogen-free cryostat, which posed distinct challenges compared to a conventional cryogenic cooling setup. The successful operation of the NQR probe within a cryogen-free cryostat has the potential to make the technique more accessible and widen applications.</description>

      <title>Particle-wave duality in electrical noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.07149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though electrical noise and conduction current are assigned to corpuscle-like electrons drifting in solid matter, this model hardly fits in the Fluctuation-Dissipation framework. However, fluctuations of energy due to displacements of single electrons between two close conductors lead to a discrete noise model looking like continuous in practice. The complex Admittance it uses for the displacement and conduction currents between such conductors, allows a treatment of fluctuations and dissipations of electrical energy that excels the example of Callen and Welton using the complex Impedance of resistors. The new model thus obtained not only unifies the phase noise of electronic oscillators with the linewidth of lasers, but also explains why the shot noise that the drift theory assigns to conduction currents is not observed.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. Our approach enables control of the emission via an external knob while preserving, in principle, the stability and linewidth characteristics. This is achieved by replacing the conventional capacitive link between the source and the reservoir with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of avoiding direct dynamical manipulation of the photon source dynamics, providing pulsed control of the emission. We validate the dynamical control of the generated state under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>A deep neural network approach to solve the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>
