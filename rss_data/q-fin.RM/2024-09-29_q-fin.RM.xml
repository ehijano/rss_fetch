      <title>The resilience of China's financial markets: With a focus on the impact of its climate policy uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience serves to assess the ability of financial markets to resist external shocks. The intensity and duration, used to indicate resilience, are calculated for China's financial markets in this paper, focusing on the performance of each financial market during and after several crises. Given that climate issues have been recognized as an important source of risk by financial markets, we also investigate the spillover effects and mechanism of China's climate policy uncertainty on its financial markets resilience. We have found that the two resilience indicators of each market have a relatively consistent trend, but spillovers among markets have different sensitivities to the both. In addition, China's climate policy uncertainty shocks its financial markets resilience by increasing the investor sentiment index and the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks and by reducing the capital and financial account balance. It is further found that China's financial markets' consensus on the unswerving implementation of climate policy, which provides the reference for other countries on how to balance climate policies introduction and financial markets development.</description>

      <title>Tail Risk Analysis for Financial Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book chapter illustrates how to apply extreme value statistics to financial time series data. Such data often exhibits strong serial dependence, which complicates assessment of tail risks. We discuss the two main approches to tail risk estimation, unconditional and conditional quantile forecasting. We use the S&amp;P 500 index as a case study to assess serial (extremal) dependence, perform an unconditional and conditional risk analysis, and apply backtesting methods. Additionally, the chapter explores the impact of serial dependence on multivariate tail dependence.</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness Results for the Clearing Problem in Financial Networks with Credit Default Swaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study computational problems in financial networks of banks connected by debt contracts and credit default swaps (CDSs). A main problem is to determine \emph{clearing} payments, for instance right after some banks have been exposed to a financial shock. Previous works have shown the $\varepsilon$-approximate version of the problem to be $\mathrm{PPAD}$-complete and the exact problem $\mathrm{FIXP}$-complete. We show that $\mathrm{PPAD}$-hardness hold when $\varepsilon \approx 0.101$, improving the previously best bound significantly. Due to the fact that the clearing problem typically does not have a unique solution, or that it may not have a solution at all in the presence of default costs, several natural decision problems are also of great interest. We show two such problems to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete, complementing previous $\mathrm{NP}$-hardness results for the approximate setting.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of second-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new characterization of second-order stochastic dominance, also known as increasing concave order. The result has an intuitive interpretation that adding a risk with negative expected value in adverse scenarios makes the resulting position generally less desirable for risk-averse agents. A similar characterization is also found for convex order and increasing convex order. The proof techniques for the main result are based on properties of Expected Shortfall, a family of risk measures that is popular in banking and insurance regulation. Applications in risk management and insurance are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic risk aversion for generalized rank-dependent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic risk aversion, defined through quasi-convexity in probabilistic mixtures, is a common useful property in decision analysis. We study a general class of non-monotone mappings, called the generalized rank-dependent functions, which includes the preference models of expected utilities, dual utilities, and rank-dependent utilities as special cases, as well as signed Choquet functions used in risk management. Our results fully characterize probabilistic risk aversion for generalized rank-dependent functions: This property is determined by the distortion function, which is precisely one of the two cases: those that are convex and those that correspond to scaled quantile-spread mixtures. Our result also leads to seven equivalent conditions for quasi-convexity in probabilistic mixtures of dual utilities and signed Choquet functions. As a consequence, although probabilistic risk aversion is quite different from the classic notion of strong risk aversion for generalized rank-dependent functions, these two notions coincide for dual utilities under an additional continuity assumption.</description>
