      <title>Model Theory of General von Neumann Algebras II: Group Actions and Crossed Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding on previous work of the author, we initiate the model theoretic study of W$^*$-dynamical systems. We axiomatize continuous weight-preserving group actions of $G$ on von Neumann algebras for $G$ a given locally compact Hausdorff group. Since our axiomatization is of continuous actions, the ultraproduct is defined so that the ultraproduct action of $G$ is also continuous. Building on a theorem of Tomatsu, we show that continuous ultraproducts commute with crossed products. Finally, we prove a suite of results about computability of the aforementioned axiomatizations and of presentations of crossed products. In particular, we show how the crossed product construction is a useful tool for producing computable presentations, giving special attention to the group measure space construction of Murray and von Neumann. Thereby, we establish interesting connections to computable dynamics and computable measure theory.</description>

      <title>The Connes-Kirchberg Problem and infinite-dimensional phenomena in quantum information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an overview of results tying together a circle of problems connected to the Connes Embedding Problem, Kirchberg's reformulations thereof, Tsirelson's conjecture and its relation to quantum information theory, and a class of quantum channels, called factorizable, introduced by Anantharaman-Delaroche. While parts of the article are more expository, there are new results, including obstructions for channels to being $k$-noisy (admitting a factorization through a full matrix algebra).</description>

      <title>The Poisson-Fourier Transform for bicrossed products I: Abelian approximations and the quantum duality principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum duality Principle of Drinfel'd states that any quantization ${\mathcal{G}}_{\hbar}$ of a Poisson-Lie group $\mathcal{G}$ should be dual as a quantum group to a quantization $\mathcal{G}^*_{\hbar}$ of the Poisson dual group $\mathcal{G}^*\!\!$. In this paper we consider pairs $(\mathcal{G} = G \ltimes V, \mathcal{G}^* = H \ltimes W)$ with $V, W$ abelian, where we can realise the quantizations ${\mathcal{G}}_{\hbar}$ and $\mathcal{G}^*_{\hbar}$ as a bicrossed product between $G$ and $H$ in the setting of locally compact quantum groups. Assuming the existence of suitable maps $\eta_G : G \to \hat W$ and $\eta_H : H \to \hat V$ which we call abelian approximations, we implement the quantum duality principle by constructing an explicit unitary operator $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{G}} : \mathrm{L}^2(\mathcal{G}) \to \mathrm{L}^2(\mathcal{G}^*)$, the Poisson-Fourier transform between $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}^*$. It induces an isomorphism of locally compact quantum group $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{G}} : \hat{\mathcal{G}}_{\hbar} \cong \mathcal{G}^*_{\hbar}$. After discussing the general framework for the Poisson-Fourier transform, we present several classes of examples of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Principal Groupoid Models for Cuntz Algebras and their Dynamic Asymptotic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the dynamic asymptotic dimension of the principal groupoid models for the Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_k$ for $2 \leq k &lt; \infty$ that have arisen from work of Winter and the authors. Our method generalises to a wide class of Deaconu-Renault groupoids. As an application of our results, we prove that $\mathcal{O}_2$ has infinitely many non-conjugate C$^*$-diagonals with Cantor spectrum, and we generalise this result to other Cuntz algebras by combining the main result with work of Kopsacheilis-Winter and Brown-Clark-Sierakowski-Sims.</description>

      <title>Semi-inner product and angles in Schatten ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Schatten $p$-class ideals for $p &gt;1$ as semi-inner product spaces in the sense of Giles and Lumer. Within this framework, we explore several geometric and analytic notions such as Birkhoff-James orthogonality, $p$-parallelism, and related properties that naturally arise when these structures are interpreted through the lens of the associated semi-inner product. Furthermore, we introduce a novel notion of angle adapted to this context, which generalizes and unifies existing angle definitions in normed spaces. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the geometry of the $p$-Schatten class and offer new perspectives on operator behavior in semi-inner product spaces.</description>

      <title>Ample groupoids that are neither almost finite nor purely infinite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a question of Matui and varations of it on minimal ample groupoids that are neither almost finite nor purely infinite. We first observe that there are already effective minimal ample transformation groupoids that are neither almost finite nor purely infinite. These groupoids can even be chosen to be amenable. Then we construct essentially principle ample groupoids that are neither almost finite nor purely infinite. These are based on the recent twisted topological groupoid construction of Palmer and Wu. In particular our new examples do not arise from transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>Non-archimedean Infinite Hecke Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the representation theory of the infinite type A Hecke algebra over a non-Archimedean field in the case where the parameter is a pseudo-uniformizer. Specifically, we consider a family of representations, called almost-symmetric, which satisfy additional topological and algebraic constraints. We give a full classification of the irreducible almost-symmetric representations. These turn out to be indexed by integer partitions arising as topological completions of specific direct limits of Hecke-Specht modules. We give detailed analysis of these representations and construct functionals analogous to finite Hecke algebra traces.</description>

      <title>Operator Systems Generated by Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of operator systems and $k$-AOU spaces generated by a finite number of projections satisfying a set of linear relations. This family is universal in the sense that the map sending the generating projections to any other set of projections which satisfy the same relations is completely positive. These operator systems are constructed as inductive limits of explicitly defined operator systems. By choosing the linear relations to be the nonsignalling relations from quantum correlation theory, we obtain a hierarchy of ordered vector spaces dual to the hierarchy of quantum correlation sets. By considering another set of relations, we also find a new necessary condition for the existence of a SIC-POVM.</description>

      <title>Rings of non-commutative functions and their fields of fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-free ideal rings, or semifirs, were introduced by Paul M. Cohn to study universal localizations in the non-commutative setting. We provide new examples of semifirs consisting of analytic functions in several non-commuting variables. These examples arise canonically in free analysis by completing the free algebra in the topology of ``uniform convergence on operator-space balls'' in the non-commutative universe of tuples of square matrices of any finite size.
  We show, in particular, that the ring of (uniformly) entire non-commutative (NC) functions in $d \in \mathbb{N}$ non-commuting variables, $\scr{O}_d$, is a semifir. Every finitely--generated right (or left) ideal in $\scr{O}_d$ is closed, which yields an analytic extension of G. Bergman's nullstellensatz for the free algebra. Any semifir admits a universal skew field of fractions; applying this to $\scr{O}_d$ yields the universal skew field of ``NC meromorphic expressions", $\scr{M} _d$. We show that any $f \in \scr{M} _d$ has a well-defined domain and evaluations in a large class of stably-finite topological algebras, including finite $C^*$-algebras, extending a result of Cohn for NC rational functions. As an application, we extend the almost sure convergence result of Haagerup and Thorbj\"ornsen for free polynomials evaluated on tuples of random matrices to the setting of NC meromorphic expressions.</description>

      <title>Strong solidity classification of Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the dichotomy that every Coxeter group either has a strongly solid group von Neumann algebra or contains the product of an infinite cyclic group and a free group of rank 2. This generalizes the same dichotomy for right-angled Coxeter groups by Borst-Caspers. However, our proof is conceptually different, which leads to a significantly streamlined argument. We also provide additional equivalent geometric and group-theoretic characterizations of strong solidity for Coxeter groups that allow us to completely classify those with a strongly solid group von Neumann algebra. In particular, we characterize strong solidity purely in terms of the defining Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. Finally, we obtain the same dichotomy for virtually cocompact special groups.</description>
