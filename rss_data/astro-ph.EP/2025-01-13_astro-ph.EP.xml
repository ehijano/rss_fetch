      <title>Planet formation and long-term stability in a very eccentric stellar binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets orbiting one of the two stars in a binary are vulnerable to gravitational perturbations from the other star. Particularly, highly eccentric companion stars risk disrupting planetary orbits, such as in the extreme system TOI 4633 where close encounters between the companion and a gas giant planet in the habitable zone make it one of the most fragile systems discovered so far. Here, we report that TOI 4633's planet likely survived these encounters throughout the system's age by orbiting retrograde relative to the binary, stabilised by the Coriolis force. Using direct $N$-body simulations, we show it otherwise tends to collide with the binary stars or becomes free-floating after getting ejected. A retrograde planetary orbit has profound implications for TOI 4633's formation and evolution, suggesting an extraordinary history where its eccentric companion was likely randomly captured after planet formation in a single-star system. Alternatively, if stars and planet are born in situ from the same gas clump, we show the planet must have formed at sub-snow-line distances, contrary to the conventional core-accretion model. Our study highlights the importance of considering the long-term stability ($\gtrsim\rm Gyr$) of planets in eccentric binaries and demonstrates that the mere existence in such dynamically hostile environments places strong constraints on their orbital configuration and formation.</description>

      <title>The 2D pressure structure of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk as probed by multi-molecular kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] Gas kinematics is a new, unique way to study planet-forming environments by an accurate characterization of disk velocity fields. High angular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks, by observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In particular, rotation curves are key tools to study the disk pressure structure and estimate fundamental disk parameters, as mass and radius. In this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecular approach to gas kinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the high quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extract the rotation curves of rotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide range in the disk radial and vertical extents. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we extend standard methodologies to fit multiple-component line profiles. We then sample the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the rotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting layers and disk thermal structure. We obtain dynamical estimates of the stellar mass $M_\star=1.89$ M$_\odot$, the disk mass $M_\text{d}=0.12$ M$_\odot$ and scale radius $ R_\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation curves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the disk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main trends we find do not depend on the adopted parametrization. Finally, we investigate the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that the thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation velocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show that such a multi-molecular approach, tracing a large range of emission layers, can provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>The $\texttt{MSG}$ model for cloudy substellar atmospheres: A grid of self-consistent substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art JWST observations are unveiling unprecedented views into the atmospheres of substellar objects in the infrared, further highlighting the importance of clouds. Current forward models struggle to fit the silicate clouds absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m observed in substellar atmospheres. In the MSG model, we aim to couple the MARCS 1D radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model with the 1D kinetic, stationary, non-equilibrium, cloud formation model DRIFT, to create a new grid of self-consistent cloudy substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation. We aim to test if this new grid is able to reproduce the silicate cloud absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m. We model substellar atmospheres with effective temperatures in the range 1200-2500 K and with $\log(g)=4.0$. We compute atmospheric structures that self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities based on microphysical properties. We present an algorithm based on control theory to help converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic atmosphere spectra are computed for each model to explore the observable impact of the cloud microphysics. We additionally explore the impact of choosing different nucleation species (TiO$_2$ or SiO) and the effect of less efficient atmospheric mixing on these spectra. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO$_2$ nucleation shows spectra which are redder in the near-infrared compared to the currently known population of substellar atmospheres. We find the models with SiO nucleation, and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the near-infrared. The grid is unable to reproduce the silicate features similar to those found in recent JWST observations and Spitzer archival data. We thoroughly discuss further work that may better approximate the impact of convection in cloud-forming regions and steps that may help resolve the silicate cloud feature.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray variability and planetary evolution in the DS Tucanae system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of four Chandra observations of the 45 Myr old DS Tuc binary system. We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor 1.8 across eight months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc Ab, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune-size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.</description>

      <title>Stellar obliquities of eight close-in gas giant exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allows us to measure the projected stellar obliquity of exoplanets. From the spin-orbit alignment, planet formation and migration theories can be tested to improve our understanding of the currently observed exoplanetary population. Despite having the spin-orbit measurements for more than 200 planets, the stellar obliquity distribution is still not fully understood, warranting additional measurements to sample the full parameter space. We analyze archival HARPS and HARPS-N spectroscopic transit time series of eight gas giant exoplanets on short orbits and derive their projected stellar obliquity $\lambda$. We report a prograde, but misaligned orbit for HAT-P-50b ($\lambda =41^\circ\ ^{+10}_{-9}$), possibly hinting at previous high-eccentricity migration given the presence of a close stellar companion. We measured sky-projected obliquities that are consistent with aligned orbits for the rest of the planets: WASP-48b ($\lambda =-4^\circ\ \pm$ 4), WASP-59b ($\lambda =-1^\circ\ ^{+20}_{-21}$), WASP-140 Ab ($\lambda =-1^\circ\ \pm$ 3), WASP-173 Ab ($\lambda =9^\circ\ \pm$ 5), TOI-2046b ($\lambda =1^\circ\ \pm$ 6), HAT-P-41 Ab ($\lambda =-4^\circ\ ^{+5}_{-6}$), and Qatar-4b ($\lambda =-13^\circ\ ^{+15}_{-19}$). We measure the true stellar obliquity $\psi$ for four systems. We infer a prograde, but misaligned, orbit for TOI-2046b with $\psi=$42$^{+10}_{-8}$\,deg. Additionally, $\psi = 30^\circ\ ^{+18}_{-15}$ for WASP-140 Ab, $\psi = 21^\circ\ ^{+9}_{-10}$ for WASP-173 Ab, and $\psi = 32^\circ\ ^{+14}_{-13}$ for Qatar-4b. The aligned orbits are consistent with slow disk migration, ruling out violent events that would excite the orbits over the history of these systems. Finally, we provide a new age estimate for TOI-2046 of at least 700 Myr and for Qatar-4 of at least 350-500 Myr, contradicting previous results.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Ephemerides Change Observations (ExoEcho). I. Transit Timing Analysis of Thirty-Seven Exoplanets using HST/WFC3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ExoEcho project is designed to study the photodynamics of exoplanets by leveraging high-precision transit timing data from ground- and space-based telescopes. Some exoplanets are experiencing orbital decay, and transit timing variation (TTV) is a useful technique to study their orbital period variations. In this study, we have obtained transit middle-time data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations for 37 short-period exoplanets, most of which are hot Jupiters. To search for potential long- and short-term orbital period variations within the sample, we conduct TTV model fitting using both linear and quadratic ephemeris models. Our analysis identifies two hot Jupiters experiencing strong periodic decays. Given the old age of the host stars of the hot Jupiter population, our findings call for a scenario where HJs are continuously being destructed and created. Our study demonstrates the importance of incorporating high-precision transit timing data to TTV study in the future.</description>

      <title>Extreme exomoons in WASP-49 Ab: dynamics and detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-49Ab, a low-density, Saturn-like planet in a tight orbit around a Sun-like star within a wide binary system, is a compelling candidate for hosting a volcanic moon, as suggested by the detection of Doppler-shifted sodium.This study evaluates the stability of potential satellites around WASP-49Ab under the influence of planetary oblateness, relativistic effects, and perturbations from a close companion star, focusing on their impact on light curve parameters such as transit duration and impact parameter variations, driven by the evolution of the planet's orbit in this extreme environment. Using N-body simulations and semi-analytical methods, we analysed moon's dynamics across varied initial conditions and gravitational frameworks including the potential of an oblate planet and the effects of the general relativity. We find that `selenity', a moon survival indicator, is high in close orbits with low eccentricity, near the Roche limit, especially for masses greater than Io's. Stability decreases as eccentricity or distance from the planet increases. Additionally, We observe a strong destabilising resonance near 1.4 planetary radii when planetary eccentricities are slightly greater than zero. This study confirms the potential for stable exomoons around WASP-49Ab despite its hostile environment, emphasizing the importance of incorporating diverse physical effects in stability analyses, aiding future detection efforts.</description>

      <title>Smuggling unnoticed: Towards a 2D view of water and dust delivery to the inner regions of protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy, e.g., with JWST, provides a glimpse into the chemical inventory of the innermost region of protoplanetary discs, where terrestrial planets eventually form. The chemical make-up of regions inside snowlines is connected to the material drifting from the outer regions, which can be modeled with dust evolution models. However, infrared observations are limited by the high dust extinction in the inner disc, and only probes the abundances of gaseous species in the disc surface layers. As a result, the bulk mass of delivered volatiles is not directly relatable to what is measured through infrared spectra. In this paper, we investigate how the delivery of dust and ice after prolonged pebble drift affects the observable reservoir of water vapor in the inner disc. We develop a 1+1D approach based on dust evolution models to determine the delivery and distribution of vapor compared to the height of the $\tau = 1$ surface in the dust continuum. We find that the observable column density of water vapor at wavelengths probed by JWST spans many orders of magnitude over time, exhibiting different radial profiles depending on dust properties, drift rate, and local processing. In the presence of a traffic-jam effect inside the snowline, the observable vapor reservoir appears constant in time despite the ongoing delivery by pebble drift, such that water is effectively smuggled unnoticed. Differences in measured column densities then originate not only from variations in bulk vapor content, but also from differences in the properties and distribution of dust particles.</description>

      <title>Dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains in protoplanetary disks are the building blocks of planets. Investigating the dust composition and size, and their variation over time, is crucial for understanding the planet formation process. The PDS 70 disk is so far the only protoplanetary disk with concrete evidence for the presence of young planets. Mid-infrared spectra were obtained for PDS 70 by the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2007 and 2022, respectively. In this work, we investigate the dust mineralogy through a detailed decomposition of the observed mid-infrared spectra. The results show that both the dust size and crystallinity increased by a factor of about two during the two epochs of observation, indicating evident dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk. The dust size (~0.8 micron) and crystallinity (~6%) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of other disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c located at radial distances of ~22AU and ~34AU, do not have a significant impact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at wavelengths longer than ~16 micron measured by JWST/MIRI are only ~60% of those obtained by Spitzer/IRS. Based on self-consistent radiative transfer modeling, we found that such a strong variability in mid-infrared fluxes can be produced by adjustments to the dust density distribution and structure of the inner disk probably induced by planet-disk interaction.</description>

      <title>Understanding what helium absorption tells us about atmospheric escape from exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape is now considered the major contributing factor in shaping the demographic of detected exoplanets. However, inferences about the exoplanet populations strongly depend on the accuracy of the models. Direct observational tests of atmospheric models are still in their infancy. Helium escape from planetary atmospheres has rapidly become the primary observational probe, already observed in $\gtrsim$20 exoplanets. Grounding our understanding in the basic physics of atmospheric escape, we present a new theoretical model to predict the excess absorption from the helium absorption line. We constrain the atmosphere properties, such as mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, by implementing a Parker wind solution with an energy limited evaporating outflow. Importantly, we self-consistently link the mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, which are critical to understanding helium absorption as the triplet-level population is typically exponentially sensitive to temperature. Furthermore, helium absorption is typically optically thin and the absorption is dominated far from the planet. Therefore, the absorption depth is not a measure of the size of the helium outflow. Our results indicate that for planets with a detectable signal, typically the helium triplet population in the atmosphere rapidly approaches a statistical equilibrium between populations by recombination and depopulation caused by electron collisions. We suggest that excess helium absorption can be quantified by a scaled equivalent width, which is positively correlated with the mass loss rate. We also show that the helium absorption scales with incident radiation, particularly with the XEUV to FUV flux ratios.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Moderate External UV Irradiation on Disk Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T-Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength of 10 to 100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO$^+$ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks, the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolved Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 Spectroscopy of Weakly-Irradiated Brown Dwarf GD 1400 and Energy Redistribution-Irradiation Trends in Six WD$-$BD Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irradiated brown dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between stellar and planetary atmospheres. We present high-quality $\mathit{HST}$/WFC3/G141 phase-resolved spectra of the white dwarf + brown dwarf binary GD 1400, covering more than one full rotation of the brown dwarf. Accounting for brightness variations caused by ZZ Ceti pulsations, we revealed weak ($\sim$1\%) phase curve amplitude modulations originating from the brown dwarf. Sub-band light curve exploration in various bands showed no significant wavelength dependence on amplitude or phase shift. Extracted day- and night-side spectra indicated chemically similar hemispheres, with slightly higher day-side temperatures, suggesting efficient heat redistribution or dominance of radiative escape over atmospheric circulation. A simple radiative and energy redistribution model reproduced observed temperatures well. Cloud-inclusive models fit the day and night spectra better than cloudless models, indicating global cloud coverage. We also begin qualitatively exploring atmospheric trends across six irradiated brown dwarfs, from the now complete "Dancing with Dwarfs" WD$-$BD sample. The trend we find in the day-side/night-side temperature and irradiation levels is consistent with efficient heat redistribution for irradiation levels less than $\sim$10$^9$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ and decreasing efficiency above that level.</description>

      <title>The Radiowave Hunt for Young Stellar Object Emission and Demographics (RADIOHEAD): A Radio Luminosity${-}$Spectral Type Dependence in Taurus${-}$Auriga YSOs</title>

Abstract: We measure the radio continuum fluxes at the locations of all Gaia${-}$confirmed members of Taurus${-}$Auriga using Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey data (VLASS; 2${-}$4 GHz, $\sigma_{\rm{VLASS}}{\sim}110{-}140 \mu$Jy, $2.5''$ resolution) spanning 3 VLASS epochs (2019, 2021, and 2023). We present 35 detections coincident with young Taurus${-}$Auriga stars (29 in individual VLASS images, 6 via stacking). We find a strong dependence on spectral type, wherein the fractional detection rate of radio emission coincident with early-type young stellar objects (YSOs) is systematically higher than late-type YSOs, ranging from 25% $\pm$ 13% for B${-}$F YSOs, 21% $\pm$ 11% for G YSOs, 18.4% $\pm$ 6.3% for K0${-}$K4 YSOs, 15.5% $\pm$ 5.4% for K5${-}$K9 YSOs, 7.0% $\pm$ 2.7% for M0${-}$M2 YSOs, 2.3% $\pm$ 0.9% for M3${-}$M6 YSOs, and 1.9% $\pm$ 1.9% for YSOs with SpTs later than M7. We present cumulative density distributions of radio luminosity densities that demonstrate a significant luminosity enhancement for early- versus late-type YSOs. We find 25% of the detected sources to be significantly variable. We discuss possible interpretations of this dependence, which may reflect stellar magnetic activity, binary interactions, or stellar flaring. We find that mid-infrared YSO class is a strong indicator of radio detectability consistent with higher frequency Taurus-Auriga VLA surveys, with class III stars detected at a rate of 8.8% $\pm$ 1.6%, class IIs at 2.0% $\pm$ 1.2%, and combined class 0s, Is and Fs at 8.0% $\pm$ 5.4%.</description>

      <title>The Role of Thermal Feedback in the Growth of Planetary Cores by Pebble Accretion in Dust Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution millimetre-imaging of protoplanetary discs has revealed many containing rings and gaps. These rings can contain large quantities of dust, often in excess of 10M$_\oplus$, providing prime sites for efficient and rapid planet formation. Rapid planet formation will produce high accretion luminosities, heating the surrounding disc. We investigate the importance of a planetary embryo's accretion luminosity by simulating the dynamics of the gas and dust in a dust ring, accounting for the energy liberated as a resident planetary embryo accretes. The resulting heating alters the flow structure near the planet, increasing the accretion rate of large, millimetre-to-centimetre-sized dust grains. We show how this process varies with the mass of dust in the ring and the local background gas temperature, demonstrating that the thermal feedback always acts to increase the planet's mass. This increase in planet mass is driven primarily by the formation of vortices, created by a baroclinic instability once the accreting planet heats the disc significantly outside its Hill radius. The vortices can then migrate with respect to the planet, resulting in a complex interplay between planetary growth, gap-opening, dust trapping and vortex dynamics. Planets formed within dust traps can have masses that exceed the classical pebble isolation mass, potentially providing massive seeds for the future formation of giant planets. Once pebble accretion ceases, the local dust size distribution is depleted in large grains, and much of the remaining dust mass is trapped in the system's L$_5$ Lagrange point, providing potentially observable signatures of this evolution.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: A Precise Water Abundance for Hot Jupiter WASP-17b from the NIRISS SOSS Transmission Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water has proven to be ubiquitously detected in near-infrared (NIR) transmission spectroscopy observations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, including WASP-17b. However, previous analyses of WASP-17b's atmosphere based upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer data could not constrain the water abundance, finding that sub-solar, super-solar and bimodal posterior distributions were all statistically valid. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b using JWST's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (NIRISS SOSS) mode. We analyze our data using three independent data analysis pipelines, finding excellent agreement between results. Our transmission spectrum shows multiple H$_2$O absorption features and a flatter slope towards the optical than seen in previous HST observations. We analyze our spectrum using both PICASO+Virga forward models and free retrievals. POSEIDON retrievals provide a well-constrained super-solar $\log$(H$_2$O) abundance (-2.96$^{+0.31}_{-0.24}$), breaking the degeneracy from the previous HST/Spitzer analysis. We verify our POSEIDON results with petitRADTRANS retrievals. Additionally, we constrain the abundance of $\log$(H$^-$), -10.19$^{+0.30}_{-0.23}$, finding that our model including H$^-$ is preferred over our model without H$^-$ to 5.1 $\sigma$. Furthermore, we constrain the $\log$(K) abundance (-8.07$^{+0.58}_{-0.52}$) in WASP-17b's atmosphere for the first time using space-based observations. Our abundance constraints demonstrate the power of NIRISS SOSS's increased resolution, precision, and wavelength range to improve upon previous NIR space-based results. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of Edge-on Protoplanetary Disks. IV. Mid-infrared Dust Scattering in the HH 30 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present near- and mid-infrared (IR) broadband imaging observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around HH 30 with the James Webb Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine these observations with archival optical/near-IR scattered light images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and a millimeter-wavelength dust continuum image obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for this target. Our multiwavelength images clearly reveal the vertical and radial segregation of micron-sized and sub-mm-sized grains in the disk. In the near- and mid-IR, the images capture not only bi-reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane but also diverse dynamical processes occurring in the HH 30 disk, such as spiral- and tail-like structures, a conical outflow, and a collimated jet. In contrast, the ALMA image reveals a flat dust disk in the disk midplane. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we show that grains of about 3 $\mu$m in radius or larger are fully vertically mixed to explain the observed mid-IR scattered light flux and its morphology, whereas millimeter-sized grains are settled into a layer with a scale height of $\gtrsim1$ au at $100$ au from the central star. We also find a tension in the disk inclination angle inferred from optical/near-IR and mm observations with the latter being closer to an exactly edge-on. Finally, we report the first detection of the proper motion of an emission knot associated with the mid-IR collimated jet detected by combining two epochs of our MIRI 12.8-$\mu$m observations.</description>

      <title>The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-Hydrodynamic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of these lines for a 10m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na I doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Halpha and Mg I 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na I eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3-10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over-optimistically) photon limited observations.</description>

      <title>NGTS-EB-7, an eccentric, long-period, low-mass eclipsing binary</title>

Abstract: Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below the convective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.</description>
