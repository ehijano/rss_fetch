      <title>Nonparametric and Semiparametric Estimation of Upward Rank Mobility Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the upward rank mobility curve as a new measure of intergenerational mobility that captures upward movements across the entire parental income distribution. Our approach extends Bhattacharya and Mazumder (2011) by conditioning on a single parental income rank, thereby eliminating aggregation bias. We show that the measure can be characterized solely by the copula of parent and child income, and we propose a nonparametric copula-based estimator with better properties than kernel-based alternatives. For a conditional version of the measure without such a representation, we develop a two-step semiparametric estimator based on distribution regression and establish its asymptotic properties. An application to U.S. data reveals that whites exhibit significant upward mobility dominance over blacks among lower-middle-income families.</description>

      <title>Automatic Order, Bandwidth Selection and Flaws of Eigen Adjustment in HAC Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent covariance matrix estimator based on the prewhitened kernel estimator and a localized leave-one-out frequency domain cross-validation (FDCV). We adapt the cross-validated log likelihood (CVLL) function to simultaneously select the order of the prewhitening vector autoregression (VAR) and the bandwidth. The prewhitening VAR is estimated by the Burg method without eigen adjustment as we find the eigen adjustment rule of Andrews and Monahan (1992) can be triggered unnecessarily and harmfully when regressors have nonzero mean. Through Monte Carlo simulations and three empirical examples, we illustrate the flaws of eigen adjustment and the reliability of our method.</description>

      <title>Nowcasting and aggregation: Why small Euro area countries matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the nowcasting of Euro area Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth using mixed data sampling machine learning panel data regressions with both standard macro releases and daily news data. Using a panel of 19 Euro area countries, we investigate whether directly nowcasting the Euro area aggregate is better than weighted individual country nowcasts. Our results highlight the importance of the information from small- and medium-sized countries, particularly when including the COVID-19 pandemic period. The empirical analysis is supplemented by studying the so-called Big Four -- France, Germany, Italy, and Spain -- and the value added of news data when official statistics are lagging. From a theoretical perspective, we formally show that the aggregation of individual components forecasted with pooled panel data regressions is superior to direct aggregate forecasting due to lower estimation error.</description>

      <title>An Econometric Analysis of the Impact of Telecare on the Length of Stay in Hospital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that links the demand for telecare to the length of stay in hospital and formulate three models that can be used to derive the treatment effect by making various assumptions about the probability distribution of the outcome measure. We then fit the models to data and estimate them using a strategy that controls for the effects of confounding variables and unobservable factors, and compare the treatment effects with that of the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) technique which adopts a quasi-experimental study design. To ensure comparability, the covariates are kept identical in all cases. An important finding that emerges from our analysis is that the treatment effects derived from our econometric models of interest are better than that obtained from an experimental study design as the latter does not account for all the relevant unobservable factors. In particular, the results show that estimating the treatment effect of telecare in the way that an experimental study design entails fails to account for the systematic variations in individuals' health production functions within each experimental arm.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Two-Stage Gradient Descent for Instrumental Variable Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression (IVaR) under differential privacy constraints. Classical IVaR methods (like two-stage least squares regression) rely on solving moment equations that directly use sensitive covariates and instruments, creating significant risks of privacy leakage and posing challenges in designing algorithms that are both statistically efficient and differentially private. We propose a noisy two-state gradient descent algorithm that ensures $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy by injecting carefully calibrated noise into the gradient updates. Our analysis establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the proposed method, showing that the algorithm achieves consistency while preserving privacy. In particular, we derive precise bounds quantifying the trade-off among privacy parameters, sample size, and iteration-complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide both privacy guarantees and provable convergence rates for instrumental variable regression in linear models. We further validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method offers practical accuracy-privacy trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Robust Semiparametric Inference for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a semiparametric framework for inference on the mean response in missing-data settings using a corrected posterior distribution. Our approach is tailored to Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), which is a powerful predictive method but whose nonsmoothness complicate asymptotic theory with multi-dimensional covariates. When using BART combined with Bayesian bootstrap weights, we establish a new Bernstein-von Mises theorem and show that the limit distribution generally contains a bias term. To address this, we introduce RoBART, a posterior bias-correction that robustifies BART for valid inference on the mean response. Monte Carlo studies support our theory, demonstrating reduced bias and improved coverage relative to existing procedures using BART.</description>

      <title>Efficient Difference-in-Differences Estimation when Outcomes are Missing at Random</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method is a fundamental tool for causal inference, yet its application is often complicated by missing data. Although recent work has developed robust DiD estimators for complex settings like staggered treatment adoption, these methods typically assume complete data and fail to address the critical challenge of outcomes that are missing at random (MAR) -- a common problem that invalidates standard estimators. We develop a rigorous framework, rooted in semiparametric theory, for identifying and efficiently estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) when either pre- or post-treatment (or both) outcomes are missing at random. We first establish nonparametric identification of the ATT under two minimal sets of sufficient conditions. For each, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound, which provides a formal benchmark for asymptotic optimality. We then propose novel estimators that are asymptotically efficient, achieving this theoretical bound. A key feature of our estimators is their multiple robustness, which ensures consistency even if some nuisance function models are misspecified. We validate the properties of our estimators and showcase their broad applicability through an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <title>Continuous permanent unobserved heterogeneity in dynamic discrete choice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dynamic discrete choice (DDC) analysis, it is common to use mixture models to control for unobserved heterogeneity. However, consistent estimation typically requires both restrictions on the support of unobserved heterogeneity and a high-level injectivity condition that is difficult to verify. This paper provides primitive conditions for point identification of a broad class of DDC models with multivariate continuous permanent unobserved heterogeneity. The results apply to both finite- and infinite-horizon DDC models, do not require a full support assumption, nor a long panel, and place no parametric restriction on the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, I propose a seminonparametric estimator that is computationally attractive and can be implemented using familiar parametric methods.</description>

      <title>Count Data Models with Heterogeneous Peer Effects under Rational Expectations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a peer effect model for count responses under rational expectations. The model accounts for heterogeneity in peer effects through groups based on observed characteristics. Identification is based on the linear model condition requiring friends' friends who are not direct friends, which I show extends to a broad class of nonlinear models. Parameters are estimated using a nested pseudo-likelihood approach. An empirical application on students' extracurricular participation reveals that females are more responsive to peers than males. An easy-to-use R package, CDatanet, is available for implementing the model.</description>

      <title>Learning control variables and instruments for causal analysis in observational data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a data-driven, machine learning-based method to detect suitable control variables and instruments for assessing the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome in observational data, if they exist. Our approach tests the joint existence of instruments, which are associated with the treatment but not directly with the outcome (at least conditional on observables), and suitable control variables, conditional on which the treatment is exogenous, and learns the partition of instruments and control variables from the observed data. The detection of sets of instruments and control variables relies on the condition that proper instruments are conditionally independent of the outcome given the treatment and suitable control variables. We establish the consistency of our method for detecting control variables and instruments under certain regularity conditions, investigate the finite sample performance through a simulation study, and provide an empirical application to labor market data from the Job Corps study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies parametric estimation and inference in a dyadic network formation model with nontransferable utilities, incorporating observed covariates and unobservable individual fixed effects. We address both theoretical and computational challenges of maximum likelihood estimation in this complex network model by proposing a new bootstrap aggregating (bagging) estimator, which is asymptotically normal, unbiased, and efficient. We extend the approach to estimating average partial effects and analyzing link function misspecification. Simulations demonstrate strong finite-sample performance. Two empirical applications to Nyakatoke risk-sharing networks and Indian microfinance data find insignificant roles of wealth differences in link formation and the strong influence of caste in Indian villages, respectively.</description>

      <title>Cohort-Anchored Robust Inference for Event-Study with Staggered Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cohort-anchored framework for robust inference in event studies with staggered adoption, building on Rambachan and Roth (2023). Robust inference based on event-study coefficients aggregated across cohorts can be misleading due to the dynamic composition of treated cohorts, especially when pre-trends differ across cohorts. My approach avoids this problem by operating at the cohort-period level. To address the additional challenge posed by time-varying control groups in modern DiD estimators, I introduce the concept of block bias: the parallel-trends violation for a cohort relative to its fixed initial control group. I show that the biases of these estimators can be decomposed invertibly into block biases. Because block biases maintain a consistent comparison across pre- and post-treatment periods, researchers can impose transparent restrictions on them to conduct robust inference. In simulations and a reanalysis of minimum-wage effects on teen employment, my framework yields better-centered (and sometimes narrower) confidence sets than the aggregated approach when pre-trends vary across cohorts. The framework is most useful in settings with multiple cohorts, sufficient within-cohort precision, and substantial cross-cohort heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Combining Experimental and Observational Data for Identification and Estimation of Long-Term Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10743v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study identifying and estimating the causal effect of a treatment variable on a long-term outcome using data from an observational and an experimental domain. The observational data are subject to unobserved confounding. Furthermore, subjects in the experiment are only followed for a short period; thus, long-term effects are unobserved, though short-term effects are available. Consequently, neither data source alone suffices for causal inference on the long-term outcome, necessitating a principled fusion of the two. We propose three approaches for data fusion for the purpose of identifying and estimating the causal effect. The first assumes equal confounding bias for short-term and long-term outcomes. The second weakens this assumption by leveraging an observed confounder for which the short-term and long-term potential outcomes share the same partial additive association with this confounder. The third approach employs proxy variables of the latent confounder of the treatment-outcome relationship, extending the proximal causal inference framework to the data fusion setting. For each approach, we develop influence function-based estimators and analyze their robustness properties. We illustrate our methods by estimating the effect of class size on 8th-grade SAT scores using data from the Project STAR experiment combined with observational data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study.</description>

      <title>A Double Machine Learning Approach to Combining Experimental and Observational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental and observational studies often lack validity due to untestable assumptions. We propose a double machine learning approach to combine experimental and observational studies, allowing practitioners to test for assumption violations and estimate treatment effects consistently. Our framework proposes a falsification test for external validity and ignorability under milder assumptions. We provide consistent treatment effect estimators even when one of the assumptions is violated. However, our no-free-lunch theorem highlights the necessity of accurately identifying the violated assumption for consistent treatment effect estimation. Through comparative analyses, we show our framework's superiority over existing data fusion methods. The practical utility of our approach is further exemplified by three real-world case studies, underscoring its potential for widespread application in empirical research.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Inference for CP Tensor Factor Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional tensor-valued data have recently gained attention from researchers in economics and finance. We consider the estimation and inference of high-dimensional tensor factor models, where each dimension of the tensor diverges. Our focus is on a factor model that admits CP-type tensor decomposition, which allows for non-orthogonal loading vectors. Based on the contemporary covariance matrix, we propose an iterative simultaneous projection estimation method. Our estimator is robust to weak dependence among factors and weak correlation across different dimensions in the idiosyncratic shocks. We establish an inferential theory, demonstrating both consistency and asymptotic normality under relaxed assumptions. Within a unified framework, we consider two eigenvalue ratio-based estimators for the number of factors in a tensor factor model and justify their consistency. Simulation studies confirm the theoretical results and an empirical application to sorted portfolios reveals three important factors: a market factor, a long-short factor, and a volatility factor.</description>

      <title>Functional Regression with Nonstationarity and Error Contamination: Application to the Economic Impact of Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a regression model with functional dependent and explanatory variables, both of which exhibit nonstationary dynamics. The model assumes that the nonstationary stochastic trends of the dependent variable are explained by those of the explanatory variables, and hence that there exists a stable long-run relationship between the two variables despite their nonstationary behavior. We also assume that the functional observations may be error-contaminated. We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to evaluating the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.</description>
