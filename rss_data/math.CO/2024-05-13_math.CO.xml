      <title>Linked tree-decompositions into finite parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every graph which admits a tree-decomposition into finite parts has a rooted tree-decomposition into finite parts that is linked, tight and componental.
  As an application, we obtain that every graph without half-grid minor has a lean tree-decomposition into finite parts, strengthening the corresponding result by Kriz and Thomas for graphs of finitely bounded tree-width. In particular, it follows that every graph without half-grid minor has a tree-decomposition which efficiently distinguishes all ends and critical vertex sets, strengthening results by Carmesin and by Elm and Kurkofka for this graph class.
  As a second application of our main result, it follows that every graph which admits a tree-decomposition into finite parts has a tree-decomposition into finite parts that displays all the ends of $G$ and their combined degrees, resolving a question of Halin from 1977. This latter tree-decomposition yields short, unified proofs of the characterisations due to Robertson, Seymour and Thomas of graphs without half-grid minor, and of graphs without binary tree subdivision.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples regarding linked and lean tree-decompositions of infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kriz and Thomas showed that every (finite or infinite) graph of tree-width $k \in \mathbb{N}$ admits a lean tree-decomposition of width $k$. We discuss a number of counterexamples demonstrating the limits of possible generalisations of their result to arbitrary infinite tree-width.
  In particular, we construct a locally finite, planar, connected graph that has no lean tree-decomposition.</description>

      <title>Counting $r\times s$ rectangles in (Catalan) words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing previous results, we introduce and study a new statistic on words, that we call rectangle capacity. For two fixed positive integers $r$ and $s$, this statistic counts the number of occurrences of a rectangle of size $r\times s$ in the bargraph representation of a word. We find the bivariate generating function for the distribution on words of the number of $r\times s$ rectangles and the generating function for their total number over all words. We also obtain the analog results for Catalan words.</description>

      <title>Classification of Integral Domains by combinatorially rich sets and extension of Goswami's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Fi} A. Fish proved that if $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are two subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ of positive upper Banach density, then there exists $k\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus{0}$ such that $k\cdot\mathbb{Z}\subset\left(E_{1}-E_{1}\right)\cdot\left(E_{2}-E_{2}\right)$. In \cite{G}, S. Goswami proved the same but a fundamental result on the set of prime numbers $\mathbb{P}$ in $\mathbb{N}$ and proved that for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $k\cdot\mathbb{N}\subset\left(\mathbb{P}-\mathbb{P}\right)\cdot\left(\mathbb{P}-\mathbb{P}\right)$. To do so, Goswami mainly proved that the product of an $IP^{\star}$-set with an $IP_{r}^{\star}$-set contains $k\mathbb{N}$. This result is very important and surprising to mathematicians who are aware of combinatorially rich sets. In this article,
we extend Goswami's result to large Lntegral Domain, that behave like $\mathbb{N}$ in the sense of some combinatorics.
we prove that for a combinatorially rich ($CR$-set) set, $A$, for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $k\cdot\mathbb{N}\subset\left(A-A\right)\cdot\left(A-A\right)$.
we provide a new proof that if we partition a large Integral Domain, $R$, into finitely many cells, then at least one cell is both additive and multiplicative central, and we prove the converse part, which is a new and unknown result.</description>

      <title>On the Correspondence Between Integer Sequences and Vacillating Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental identity in the representation theory of the partition algebra is $n^k = \sum_{\lambda} f^\lambda m_k^\lambda$ for $n \geq 2k$, where $\lambda$ ranges over integer partitions of $n$, $f^\lambda$ is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$, and $m_k^\lambda$ is the number of vacillating tableaux of shape $\lambda$ and length $2k$. Using a combination of RSK insertion and jeu de taquin, Halverson and Lewandowski constructed a bijection $DI_n^k$ that maps each integer sequence in $[n]^k$ to a pair of tableaux of the same shape, where one is a standard Young tableau and the other is a vacillating tableau. In this paper, we study the fine properties of Halverson and Lewandowski's bijection and explore the correspondence between integer sequences and the vacillating tableaux via the map $DI_n^k$ for general integers $n$ and $k$. In particular, we characterize the integer sequences $\boldsymbol{i}$ whose corresponding shape, $\lambda$, in the image $DI_n^k(\boldsymbol{i})$, satisfies $\lambda_1 = n$ or $\lambda_1 = n-k$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Sombor index of the total graph and unit graph of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ which is denoted by $T_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ and $G(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ respectively for $n \in \{2k, p^{\alpha}, pq, p^2q\}$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct odd prime numbers such that $p &lt; q$. Moreover, we compute the Sombor index of any finite local ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we find the polynomial extension of Beigelb\"{o}ck's \cite{b} multidimensional Central Sets Theorem (which was a common extension of Furstenberg's Central Sets Theorem and Milliken-Taylor theorem). Then we derive a common extension of Bergelson, Hindman, and William's \cite{bhw} polynomial Milliken-Taylor theorem, and the polynomial multidimensional Central Sets Theorem. We also find a sufficient condition over two distinct multidimensional polynomials for which their Milliken-Taylor image lies in the same color. This result gives a partial polynomial extension of Deuber, Hindman, Leader, and Lefmann's \cite{d} result on separating the Milliken-Taylor system.</description>

      <title>On the distance problem over finite p-adic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distance problem in the setting of finite p-adic rings. In odd dimensions, our results are essentially sharp. In even dimensions, we clarify the conjecture and provide examples to support it. Surprisingly, compared to the finite field case, in this setting, we are able to provide a large family of sets such that the distance conjecture holds. By developing new restriction type estimates associated to circles and orbits, with a group theoretic argument, we will prove the $4/3$-parallel result in the two dimensions. This answers a question raised by Alex Iosevich. In a more general scenario, the existence/distribution of geometric/graph configurations will be also considered in this paper. Our results present improvements and extensions of recent results due to Ben Lichtin (2019, 2023). In comparison with Lichtin's method, our approach is much simpler and flexible, which is also one of the novelties in this paper.</description>

      <title>The Rank-Ramsey Problem and the Log-Rank Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called Rank-Ramsey if (i) Its clique number is small, and (ii) The adjacency matrix of its complement has small rank. We initiate a systematic study of such graphs. Our main motivation is that their constructions, as well as proofs of their non-existence, are intimately related to the famous log-rank conjecture from the field of communication complexity. These investigations also open interesting new avenues in Ramsey theory.
  We construct two families of Rank-Ramsey graphs exhibiting polynomial separation between order and complement rank. Graphs in the first family have bounded clique number (as low as $41$). These are subgraphs of certain strong products, whose building blocks are derived from triangle-free strongly-regular graphs. Graphs in the second family are obtained by applying Boolean functions to Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Their clique number is logarithmic, but their complement rank is far smaller than in the first family, about $\mathcal{O}(n^{2/3})$. A key component of this construction is our matrix-theoretic view of lifts.
  We also consider lower bounds on the Rank-Ramsey numbers, and determine them in the range where the complement rank is $5$ or less. We consider connections between said numbers and other graph parameters, and find that the two best known explicit constructions of triangle-free Ramsey graphs turn out to be far from Rank-Ramsey.</description>

      <title>Total coloring graphs with large maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any graph $G$, the total chromatic number of $G$ is at most $\Delta(G)+2\left\lceil \frac{|V(G)|}{\Delta(G)+1} \right\rceil$. This saves one color in comparison with a result of Hind from 1992. In particular, our result says that if $\Delta(G)\ge \frac{1}{2}|V(G)|$, then $G$ has a total coloring using at most $\Delta(G)+4$ colors. When $G$ is regular and has a sufficient number of vertices, we can actually save an additional two colors. Specifically, we prove that for any $0&lt;\varepsilon &lt;1$, there exists $n_0\in \mathbb{N}$ such that: if $G$ is an $r$-regular graph on $n \ge n_0$ vertices with $r\ge \frac{1}{2}(1+\varepsilon) n$, then $\chi_T(G) \le \Delta(G)+2$. This confirms the Total Coloring Conjecture for such graphs $G$.</description>

      <title>On treewidth and maximum cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct classes of graphs that are variants of the so-called layered wheel. One of their key properties is that while the treewidth is bounded by a function of the clique number, the construction can be adjusted to make the dependance grow arbitrarily. Some of these classes provide counter-examples to several conjectures. In particular, the construction includes hereditary classes of graphs whose treewidth is bounded by a function of the clique number while the tree-independence number is unbounded, thus disproving a conjecture of Dallard, Milani\v{c} and \v{S}torgel [Treewidth versus clique number. II. Tree-independence number. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 164:404-442, 2024.]. The construction can be further adjusted to provide, for any fixed integer $c$, graphs of arbitrarily large treewidth that contain no $K_c$-free graphs of high treewidth, thus disproving a conjecture of Hajebi [Chordal graphs, even-hole-free graphs and sparse obstructions to bounded treewidth, arXiv:2401.01299, 2024].</description>

      <title>Separation axiom $S_3$ for geodesic convexity in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semispaces of a convexity space $(X,C)$ are maximal convex sets missing a point. The separation axiom $S_3$ asserts that any point $x_0\in X$ and any convex set $A$ not containing $x_0$ can be separated by complementary halfspaces (convex sets with convex complements) or, equivalently, that all semispaces are halfspaces. In this paper, we study $S_3$ for geodesic convexity in graphs and the structure of semispaces in $S_3$-graphs. We characterize $S_3$-graphs and their semispaces in terms of separation by halfspaces of vertices $x_0$ and special sets, called maximal $x_0$-proximal sets and in terms of convexity of their mutual shadows $x_0/K$ and $K/x_0$. In $S_3$-graphs $G$ satisfying the triangle condition (TC), maximal proximal sets are the pre-maximal cliques of $G$ (i.e., cliques $K$ such that $K\cup\{ x_0\}$ are maximal cliques). This allows to characterize the $S_3$-graphs satisfying (TC) in a structural way and to enumerate their semispaces efficiently. In case of meshed graphs (an important subclass of graphs satisfying (TC)), the $S_3$-graphs have been characterized by excluding five forbidden subgraphs. On the way of proving this result, we also establish some properties of meshed graphs, which maybe of independent interest. In particular, we show that any connected, locally-convex set of a meshed graph is convex. We also provide several examples of $S_3$-graphs, including the basis graphs of matroids. Finally, we consider the (NP-complete) halfspace separation problem, describe two methods of its solution, and apply them to particular classes of graphs and graph-convexities.</description>

      <title>A new approach to Naples parking functions through complete parking preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naples parking functions were introduced as a generalization of classical parking functions, in which cars are allowed to park backwards, by checking up to a fixed number of previous spots, before proceeding forward as usual. In this work we introduce the notion of a complete parking preference, through which we are able to give some information on the combinatorics of Naples parking functions. Roughly speaking, a complete parking preference is a parking preference such that, for any index $j$, there are more cars with preference at least $j$ than spots available from $j$ onward. We provide a characterization of Naples parking functions in terms of certain complete subsequences of them. As a consequence of this result we derive a characterization of permutation-invariant Naples parking functions which turns out to be equivalent to the one given by (Carvalho et al., 2021), but using a totally different approach (and language).</description>

      <title>The degree of functions in the Johnson and q-Johnson schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1982, Cameron and Liebler investigated certain "special sets of lines" in PG(3,q), and gave several equivalent characterizations. Due to their interesting geometric and algebraic properties, these "Cameron-Liebler line classes" got a lot of attention. Several generalizations and variants have been considered in the literature, the main directions being a variation of the dimensions of the involved spaces, and studying the analogous situation in the subset lattice. An important tool is the interpretation of the objects as Boolean functions in the "Johnson" and "q-Johnson schemes".
  In this article, we develop a unified theory covering all these variations. Generalized versions of algebraic and geometric properties will be investigated, having a parallel in the notion of "designs" and "antidesigns" in association schemes, which is connected to Delsarte's concept of "design-orthogonality". This leads to a natural definition of the "degree" and the "weights" of functions in the ambient scheme, refining the existing definitions. We will study the effect of dualization and of elementary modifications of the ambient space on the degree and the weights. Moreover, a divisibility property of the sizes of Boolean functions of degree t will be proven.</description>

      <title>Expansions of the Potts model partition function along deletions and contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two expansions of the Potts model partition function of a graph. One is along the deletions of a graph, a rewritten formula given in Biggs (1977). The other is along the contractions of a graph. Then, we specialize the partition function to the chromatic or flow polynomial by the M\"obius inversion formula, and prove two known equations of the two polynomials. One expresses the chromatic polynomial as a weighted sum of flow polynomials of deletions, the other expresses the flow polynomial as a weighted sum of chromatic polynomials of contractions. The proof of the former by Biggs formula is due to Bychkov et al. (2021). The two expressions are considered to be dual in the sense of their forms, and transfer to each other with plane duality. This relation also holds in our expansions of the Potts model partition function. We clarify this duality by using matroid duality. Partition functions can be extended to matroids, and the two expansions can also be extended. The two expansions transfer to each other with matroid duality, so in addition to an elementary combinatorial proof of the two, we give another proof by the "duality" relation between them.</description>

      <title>Cycle switching in Steiner triple systems of order 19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycle switching is a particular form of transformation applied to isomorphism classes of a Steiner triple system of a given order $v$ (an $STS(v)$), yielding another $STS(v)$. This relationship may be represented by an undirected graph. An $STS(v)$ admits cycles of lengths $4,6,\ldots,v-7$ and $v-3$. In the particular case of $v=19$, it is known that the full switching graph, allowing switching of cycles of any length, is connected. We show that if we restrict switching to only one of the possible cycle lengths, in all cases the switching graph is disconnected (even if we ignore those $STS(19)$s which have no cycle of the given length). Moreover, in a number of cases we find intriguing connected components in the switching graphs which exhibit unexpected symmetries. Our method utilises an algorithm for determining connected components in a very large implicitly defined graph which is more efficient than previous approaches, avoiding the necessity of computing canonical labellings for a large proportion of the systems.</description>

      <title>The number of cliques in hypergraphs with forbidden subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximum number of $r$-vertex cliques in $(r-1)$-uniform hypergraphs not containing complete $r$-partite hypergraphs $K_r^{(r-1)}(a_1, \dots, a_r)$. By using the hypergraph removal lemma, we show that this maximum is $o( n^{r - 1/(a_1 \cdots a_{r-1})} )$. This immediately implies the corresponding results of Mubayi and Mukherjee and of Balogh, Jiang, and Luo for graphs. We also provide a lower bound by using hypergraph Tur\'an numbers.</description>

      <title>New lower bound on ball packing density in high-dimensional hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new lower bound on the Bowen-Radin maximal density of radius-R ball packings in the m-dimensional hyperbolic space, improving on the basic covering bound by factor \Omega(m(R+\ln m)) as m tends to infinity. This is done by applying the recent theorem of Campos, Jenssen, Michelen and Sahasrabudhe on independent sets in graphs with sparse neighbourhoods.</description>

      <title>An almost complete $t$-intersection theorem for permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $n&gt;(1+\epsilon)t$, $n&gt;n_0(\epsilon)$ we determine the size of the largest $t$-intersecting family of permutations, as well as give a sharp stability result. This resolves a conjecture of Ellis, Friedgut and Pilpel (2011) and shows the validity of conjectures of Frankl and Deza (1977) and Cameron (1988) for $n&gt;(1+\epsilon )t$. We note that, for this range of parameters, the extremal examples are not necessarily trivial, and that our statement is analogous to the celebrated Ahlswede-Khachatrian theorem. The proof is based on the refinement of the method of spread approximations, recently introduced by Kupavskii and Zakharov (2022).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Ferrers rook graph is a graph whose vertices correspond to the dots in a Ferrers diagram, and where two vertices are adjacent if they are in the same row or the same column. We propose a conjectural formula for the gonality of Ferrers rook graphs, and prove this conjecture for a few infinite families of Ferrers diagrams. We also prove the conjecture for all Ferrers diagrams $F$ with $|F| \leq 8$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $P$, we study the _whirling_ action on vertex-labelings of $P$ with the elements $\{0,1,2,\dotsc ,k\}$. When such labelings are (weakly) order-reversing, we call them $k$-bounded $P$-partitions. We give a general equivariant bijection between $k$-bounded $P$-partitions and order ideals of the poset $P\times [k]$ which conveys whirling to the well-studied rowmotion operator. As an application, we derive periodicity and homomesy results for rowmotion acting on the chain of V's poset $V \times [k]$. We are able to generalize some of these results to the more complicated dynamics of rowmotion on $C_{n}\times [k]$, where $C_{n}$ is the claw poset with $n$ unrelated elements each covering $\widehat{0}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convolution product of two generic conjugacy classes of the unitary group $U_n$ is described by a probability distribution on the space of central measures which admits a density. Relating the convolution to the quantum Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and using recent results describing those coefficients, we give a manifestly positive formula for this density. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this expression also provides a positive formula for the volume of moduli spaces of $SU_n$-valued flat connections on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum of characters.</description>

      <title>A Vector Representation for Phylogenetic Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Good representations for phylogenetic trees and networks are important for optimizing storage efficiency and implementation of scalable methods for the inference and analysis of evolutionary trees for genes, genomes and species. We introduce a new representation for rooted phylogenetic trees that encodes a binary tree on n taxa as a vector of length 2n in which each taxon appears exactly twice. Using this new tree representation, we introduce a novel tree rearrangement operator, called a HOP, that results in a tree space of diameter n and a quadratic neighbourhood size. We also introduce a novel metric, the HOP distance, which is the minimum number of HOPs to transform a tree into another tree. The HOP distance can be computed in near-linear time, a rare instance of a tree rearrangement distance that is tractable. Our experiments show that the HOP distance is better correlated to the Subtree-Prune-and-Regraft distance than the widely used Robinson-Foulds distance. We also describe how the novel tree representation we introduce can be further generalized to tree-child networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine when the irreducible modules $L(c_{p, q}, h_{m, n})$ over the simple Virasoro vertex algebras $\operatorname{Vir}_{p, q}$, where $p, q \ge 2$ are relatively prime with $0 &lt; m &lt; p$ and $0 &lt; n &lt; q$, are classically free. It turns out this only happens with the boundary minimal models, i.e., with the irreducible modules over $\operatorname{Vir}_{2, 2s + 1}$ for $s \in \mathbb{Z}_+$. We thus obtain a complete description of the classical limits of these modules in terms of the jet algebra of the corresponding Zhu $C_2$-algebra. Gordon's generalization of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities is used in the proof, and our results in turn provide a natural interpretation of these identities.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for polylogarithmic graph distances in scale-free percolation and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study graph distances in the geometric random graph models scale-free percolation SFP, geometric inhomogeneous random graphs GIRG, and hyperbolic random graphs HRG. Despite the wide success of the models, the parameter regime in which graph distances are polylogarithmic is poorly understood. We provide new and improved lower bounds. In a certain portion of the parameter regime, those match the known upper bounds.
  Compared to the best previous lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich, our result has several advantages: it gives matching bounds for a larger range of parameters, thus settling the question for a larger portion of the parameter space. It strictly improves the lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich for all parameters settings in which those bounds were not tight. It gives tail bounds on the probability of having short paths, which imply shape theorems for the $k$-neighbourhood of a vertex whenever our lower bounds are tight, and tight bounds for the size of this $k$-neighbourhood. And last but not least, our proof is much simpler and not much longer than two pages, and we demonstrate that it generalizes well by showing that the same technique also works for first passage percolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties are subvarieties of full flag varieties, while regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties are subvarieties of partial flag varieties. In this manuscript we first provide a summand formula and a product formula for the Poincar\'e polynomial of regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties. It is well-known that there is an isomorphism between the cohomology rings of partial flag varieties and the invariants in the cohomology rings of full flag varieties under an action of a certain Weyl group by Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand. We generalize this result to regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties. More concretely, we give an isomorphism between the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties and the invariant subrings of the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties under the certain Weyl group action. Furthermore, we provide a description of the cohomology rings for regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties in terms of the invariants in the logarithmic derivation modules of ideal arrangements, which is a genelarization of the result by Abe-Masuda-Murai-Sato with the author.</description>

      <title>Critical probabilities for positively associated, finite-range dependent percolation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a locally finite, infinite tree $T$, let $p_c(T)$ denote the critical probability for Bernoulli percolation. We prove that every positively associated, finite-range dependent percolation model on $T$ with marginals $p &gt; p_c(T)$ must percolate. Among finite-range dependent models on trees, positive association is thus a favourable property for percolation to occur.
  On general graphs of bounded degree, Liggett, Schonmann and Stacey (1997) proved that finite-range dependent percolation models with sufficiently large marginals stochastically dominate product measures. Under the additional assumption of positive association, we prove that stochastic domination actually holds for arbitrary marginals. Our result thereby generalises Proposition 3.4 in Liggett, Schonmann and Stacey (1997) which was restricted to the special case $G = \mathbb{Z}$.
  Studying the class of 1-independent percolation models has proven useful in bounding critical probabilities of various percolation models via renormalization. In many cases, the renormalized model is not only 1-independent but also positively associated. This motivates us to introduce the smallest parameter $p_a^+(G)$ such that every positively associated, 1-independent bond percolation model on a graph $G$ with marginals $p &gt; p_a^+(G)$ percolates. We obtain quantitative upper and lower bounds on $p_a^+(\mathbb{Z}^2)$ and on $p_a^+(\mathbb{Z}^n)$ as $n\to \infty$, and also study the case of oriented bond percolation. In proving these results, we revisit several techniques originally developed for Bernoulli percolation, which become applicable thanks to a simple but seemingly new way of combining positive association with finite-range dependence.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with binomial edge ideal $J_G$. We prove how to calculate the multidegree of $J_G$ based on combinatorial properties of $G$. In particular, we study the set $S_{\min}(G)$ defined as the collection of subsets of vertices whose prime ideals have minimum codimension. We provide results which assist in determining $S_{\min}(G)$, then calculate $S_{\min}(G)$ for star, horned complete, barbell, cycle, wheel, and friendship graphs, and use the main result of the paper to obtain the multidegrees of their binomial edge ideals.</description>

      <title>Robertson's conjecture I. Well-quasi-ordering bounded tree-width graphs by the topological minor relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.00192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robertson and Seymour's celebrated Graph Minor Theorem states that graphs are well-quasi-ordered by the minor relation. Unlike the minor relation, the topological minor relation does not well-quasi-order graphs in general. Among all known infinite antichains with respect to the topological containment, subdivisions of a graph obtained from an arbitrarily long path by duplicating each edge can be found. In the 1980's Robertson conjectured that this is the only obstruction. Formally, he conjectured that for every positive integer $k$, graphs that do not contain the graph obtained from a path of length $k$ by duplicating each edge as a topological minor are well-quasi-ordered by the topological minor relation. The case $k=1$ implies Kruskal's Tree Theorem, and the case $k=2$ implies a conjecture of V\'{a}zsonyi on subcubic graphs.
  This series of papers dedicates a proof of Robertson's conjecture. We prove Robertson's conjecture for graphs of bounded tree-width in this paper. It is an essential step toward the complete proof of Robertson's conjecture, and the machinery developed in this paper will be applied in future papers of the series. This bounded tree-width case proved in this paper implies all known results about well-quasi-ordering graphs by the topological minor relation that can be proved without using the Graph Minor Theorem, and our proof in this paper is self-contained.</description>

This paper aims to establish a version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Grothendieck polynomials of the Grassmannian type. This rule allows us to express the product of a Grothendieck polynomial with a power sum symmetric polynomial into a linear combination of other Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <title>On Good $2$-Query Locally Testable Codes from Sheaves on High Dimensional Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expose a strong connection between good $2$-query locally testable codes (LTCs) and high dimensional expanders. Here, an LTC is called good if it has constant rate and linear distance. Our emphasis in this work is on LTCs testable with only $2$ queries, which are of particular interest to theoretical computer science. This is done by introducing a new object called a sheaf that is put on top of a high dimensional expander. Sheaves are vastly studied in topology. Here, we introduce sheaves on simplicial complexes. Moreover, we define a notion of an expanding sheaf that has not been studied before.
  We present a framework to get good infinite families of $2$-query LTCs from expanding sheaves on high dimensional expanders, utilizing towers of coverings of these high dimensional expanders. Starting with a high dimensional expander and an expanding sheaf, our framework produces an infinite family of codes admitting a $2$-query tester. We show that if the initial sheaved high dimensional expander satisfies some conditions, which can be checked in constant time, then these codes form a family of good $2$-query LTCs.
  We give candidates for sheaved high dimensional expanders which can be fed into our framework, in the form of an iterative process which conjecturally produces such candidates given a high dimensional expander and a special auxiliary sheaf. (We could not verify the prerequisites of our framework for these candidates directly because of computational limitations.) We analyse this process experimentally and heuristically, and identify some properties of the fundamental group of the high dimensional expander at hand which are sufficient (but not necessary) to get the desired sheaf, and consequently an infinite family of good $2$-query LTCs.</description>

      <title>Kempe Classes and Almost Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $k$ be a positive integer, and let $Kc(G, k)$ denote the number of Kempe equivalence classes for the $k$-colorings of $G$. In 2006, Mohar noted that $Kc(G, k) = 1$ if $G$ is bipartite. As a generalization, we show that $Kc(G, k) = 1$ if $G$ is formed from a bipartite graph by adding any number of edges less than $\binom{\lceil k/2\rceil}2+\binom{\lfloor k/2\rfloor}2$. We show that our result is tight (up to lower order terms) by constructing, for each $k \geq 8$, a graph $G$ formed from a bipartite graph by adding $(k^2+8k-45+1)/4$ edges such that $Kc(G, k) \geq 2$. This refutes a recent conjecture of Higashitani--Matsumoto.</description>

      <title>Cliques, Chromatic Number, and Independent Sets in the Semi-random Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-random graph process is a single player game in which the player is initially presented an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible. In this paper, we investigate the following three properties: containing a complete graph of order $k$, having the chromatic number at least $k$, and not having an independent set of size at least $k$.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the number of multidimensional partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain estimates for the number $p_d(n)$ of $(d-1)$-dimensional integer partitions of a number $n$. It is known that the two-sided inequality $C_1(d)n^{1-1/d}&lt;\log p_d(n)&lt; C_2(d)n^{1-1/d}$ is always true and that $C_1(d)&gt;1$ whenever $\log n&gt; 3d$. However, establishing the $``$right$"$ dependence of $C_2$ on $d$ remained an open problem. We show that if $d$ is sufficiently small with respect to $n$, then $C_2$ does not depend on $d$, which means that $\log p_d(n)$ is up to an absolute constant equal to $n^{1-1/d}$. Besides, we provide estimates of $p_d(n)$ for different ranges of $d$ in terms of $n$, which give the asymptotics of $\log p_d(n)$ in each case.</description>

Abstract: A $3$-polytope is a $3$-connected, planar graph. It is called unigraphic if it does not share its vertex degree sequence with any other $3$-polytope, up to graph isomorphism. The classification of unigraphic $3$-polytopes appears to be a difficult problem.
  In this paper we prove that, apart from pyramids, all unigraphic $3$-polytopes have no $n$-gonal faces for $n\geq 10$. Our method involves defining several planar graph transformations on a given $3$-polytope containing an $n$-gonal face with $n\geq 10$. The delicate part is to prove that, for every such $3$-polytope, at least one of these transformations both preserves $3$-connectivity, and is not an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an number of the odd-ballooning of complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $L$, the Tur\'an number $\textrm{ex}(n,L)$ is the maximum possible number of edges in an $n$-vertex $L$-free graph. The study of Tur\'an number of graphs is a central topic in extremal graph theory. Although the celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits theorem gives the asymptotic value of $\textrm{ex}(n,L)$ for nonbipartite $L$, it is challenging in general to determine the exact value of $\textrm{ex}(n,L)$ for $\chi(L) \geq 3$. The odd-ballooning of $H$ is a graph such that each edge of $H$ is replaced by an odd cycle and all new vertices of odd cycles are distinct. Here the length of odd cycles is not necessarily equal. The exact value of Tur\'an number of the odd-ballooning of $H$ is previously known for $H$ being a cycle, a path, a tree with assumptions, and $K_{2,3}$. In this paper, we manage to obtain the exact value of Tur\'an number of the odd-ballooning of $K_{s,t}$ with $2\leq s \leq t$, where $(s,t) \not \in \{(2,2),(2,3)\} $ and each odd cycle has length at least five.</description>

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Fishburn studied the maximum number of points in the plane that span $k$ distances and classified these configurations, as an inverse problem of the Erd\H{o}s distinct distances problem. We consider the analogous problem for triangles. Past work has obtained the optimal sets for one and two distinct triangles in the plane. In this paper, we resolve a conjecture that at most six points in the plane can span three distinct triangles, and obtain the hexagon as the unique configuration that achieves this. We also provide evidence that optimal sets cannot be on the square lattice in the general case.</description>

      <title>Interval and $\ell$-interval Rational Parking Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interval parking functions are a generalization of parking functions in which cars have an interval preference for their parking. We generalize this definition to parking functions with $n$ cars and $m\geq n$ parking spots, which we call interval rational parking functions and provide a formula for their enumeration. By specifying an integer parameter $\ell\geq 0$, we then consider the subset of interval rational parking functions in which each car parks at most $\ell$ spots away from their initial preference. We call these $\ell$-interval rational parking functions and provide recursive formulas to enumerate this set for all positive integers $m\geq n$ and $\ell$. We also establish formulas for the number of nondecreasing $\ell$-interval rational parking functions via the outcome map on rational parking functions. We also consider the intersection between $\ell$-interval parking functions and Fubini rankings and show the enumeration of these sets is given by generalized Fibonacci numbers. We conclude by specializing $\ell=1$, and establish that the set of $1$-interval rational parking functions with $n$ cars and $m$ spots are in bijection with the set of barred preferential arrangements of $[n]$ with $m-n$ bars. This readily implies enumerative formulas. Further, in the case where $\ell=1$, we recover the results of Hadaway and Harris that unit interval parking functions are in bijection with the set of Fubini rankings, which are enumerated by the Fubini numbers.</description>

      <title>Crystals for set-valued decomposition tableaux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe two crystal structures on set-valued decomposition tableaux. These provide the first examples of interesting "$K$-theoretic" crystals on shifted tableaux. Our first crystal is modeled on a similar construction of Monical, Pechenik, and Scrimshaw for semistandard (unshifted) set-valued tableaux. Our second crystal is adapted from the "square root" operators introduced by Yu on the same set. Neither of our shifted crystals is normal, but we conjecture that our second construction is connected with a unique highest weight element. These results lead to partial progress on a conjectural formula of Cho--Ikeda for $K$-theoretic Schur $P$-functions. We also study a new category of "square root crystals" that includes our second construction and Yu's set-valued tableau crystals as examples. We observe that Buch's formula for the coefficients expanding products of symmetric Grothendieck functions has a simple description in terms of the tensor product for this category.</description>

      <title>Two Formulas for the Number of Lines on Complex Projective Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13206v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two formulas for the classical number $C_n$ of lines on a generic hypersurface of degree $2n-3$ in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ are obtained which differ from the formulas by Dominici, Harris, Libgober, and van der Waerden-Zagier. We review the splitting principle computation by Harris obtaining a similar general closed-form formula in terms of the Catalan numbers and elementary symmetric polynomials. This in turn yields $C_n$ as a linear difference recursion relation of unbounded order. Thus, for the sequence of certain linear combinations of $C_n$, a simple generating function is found. Then, a result from random algebraic geometry by Basu, Lerario, Lundberg, and Peterson, that expresses these classical enumerative invariants as proportional to the Bombieri norm of particular polynomial determinants, yields another combinatorial expansion in terms of certain set compositions and block labeling counting. As an example, we compute this combinatorial interpretation for the cases of 27 lines on a cubic surface and 2875 lines on a quintic threefold. As an application, we reobtain the parity and asymptotic upper bound of the sequence. In an appendix, we generalize the splitting principle calculation to obtain a formula for the number of lines on a generic complete intersection.</description>

      <title>Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes and Lifted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the "generalized Ulam problem," studying the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky initiated a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the exact large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. The requisite generating function enumerates pairs of up-right paths in $d=2$, which both end at $(k,\ell)$ with a given number of intersections. We also evaluate the analogous generating function for pairs of $(+\boldsymbol{i},+\boldsymbol{j},+\boldsymbol{k})$ paths in $d=3$, which both end at $(k,\ell,m)$, which has some utility in calculating the 3rd moment. Finally, we consider a simpler problem involving partitions instead of permutations, where all moments are calculable and the replica symmetric ansatz can be stated if not proved.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Distance-$d$ Independent Set Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07199v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed positive integer $d \geq 2$, a distance-$d$ independent set (D$d$IS) of a graph is a vertex subset whose distance between any two members is at least $d$. Imagine that there is a token placed on each member of a D$d$IS. Two D$d$ISs are adjacent under Token Sliding ($\mathsf{TS}$) if one can be obtained from the other by moving a token from one vertex to one of its unoccupied adjacent vertices. Under Token Jumping ($\mathsf{TJ}$), the target vertex needs not to be adjacent to the original one. The Distance-$d$ Independent Set Reconfiguration (D$d$ISR) problem under $\mathsf{TS}/\mathsf{TJ}$ asks if there is a corresponding sequence of adjacent D$d$ISs that transforms one given D$d$IS into another. The problem for $d = 2$, also known as the Independent Set Reconfiguration problem, has been well-studied in the literature and its computational complexity on several graph classes has been known. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of D$d$ISR on different graphs under $\mathsf{TS}$ and $\mathsf{TJ}$ for any fixed $d \geq 3$. On chordal graphs, we show that D$d$ISR under $\mathsf{TJ}$ is in $\mathtt{P}$ when $d$ is even and $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete when $d$ is odd. On split graphs, there is an interesting complexity dichotomy: D$d$ISR is $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $d = 2$ but in $\mathtt{P}$ for $d=3$ under $\mathsf{TS}$, while under $\mathsf{TJ}$ it is in $\mathtt{P}$ for $d = 2$ but $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $d = 3$. Additionally, certain well-known hardness results for $d = 2$ on perfect graphs and planar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth can be extended for $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Patrolling Grids with a Bit of Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of patrolling regular grid graphs of any dimension using a single mobile agent with minimal memory and limited sensing range. We show that it is impossible to patrol some grid graphs with $0$ bits of memory, regardless of sensing range, and give an exact characterization of those grid graphs that can be patrolled with $0$ bits of memory and sensing range $V$. On the other hand, we show that an algorithm exists using $1$ bit of memory and $V=1$ that patrols any $d$-dimensional grid graph. This result is surprising given that the agent must be able to move in $2d$ distinct directions to patrol, while $1$ bit of memory allows specifying only two directions per sensory input. Our $1$-bit patrolling algorithm handles this by carefully exploiting a small state-space to access all the needed directions while avoiding getting stuck. Overall, our results give concrete evidence that extremely little memory is needed for patrolling highly regular environments like grid graphs compared to arbitrary graphs. The techniques we use, such as partitioning the environment into sensing regions and exploiting distinct coordinates resulting from higher-dimensionality, may be applicable to analyzing the space complexity of patrolling in other types of regular environments as well.</description>

      <title>Characters of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ and vertex operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vertex operator approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of the general linear group $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$. Green's theory of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R_G=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}R(\GL_n(\mathbb F_q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces associated to two infinite-dimensional $F$-equivariant Heisenberg Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\hat{\overline{\mathbb F}}_q}$ and $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\overline{\mathbb F}_q}$, where $F$ is the Frobenius automorphism of the algebraically closed field $\overline{\mathbb F}_q$. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. One of the features of the current approach is a simpler identification of the Fock space $R_G$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions via vertex operator calculus, and another is that we are able to compute in general the character table, where Green's degree formula is demonstrated as an example.</description>

      <title>Cluster categories for completed infinity-gons I: Categorifying triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m recently introduced cluster-type categories for completed infinity-gons, which are discs with an infinite closed set of marked points on their boundary. They classify (weak) cluster-tilting subcategories, which turn out to be in bijection with very special triangulations of the disc. This is in contrast to Igusa and Todorov's earlier work in the uncompleted case, in which every triangulation corresponds to a weak cluster-tilting subcategory.
  In this paper, we replace the triangulated structure of Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m's category by an extriangulated substructure and prove that, with this structure, the weak cluster-tilting subcategories are once again in bijection with triangulations. We further show that functorial finiteness of such a subcategory is equivalent to a very mild condition on the triangulation. This condition also appears in \c{C}anak\c{c}{\i} and Felikson's study of infinite rank cluster algebras from Teichm\"uller theory. By comparison with the combinatorics of triangulations, we are also able to characterise when weak cluster-tilting subcategories can be mutated in this new extriangulated category.</description>

      <title>Explicit Good Codes Approaching Distance 1 in Ulam Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ulam distance of two permutations on $[n]$ is $n$ minus the length of their longest common subsequence. In this paper, we show that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists some $\alpha&gt;0$, and an infinite set $\Gamma\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, such that for all $n\in\Gamma$, there is an explicit set $C_n$ of $(n!)^{\alpha}$ many permutations on $[n]$, such that every pair of permutations in $C_n$ has pairwise Ulam distance at least $(1-\varepsilon)\cdot n$. Moreover, we can compute the $i^{\text{th}}$ permutation in $C_n$ in poly$(n)$ time and can also decode in poly$(n)$ time, a permutation $\pi$ on $[n]$ to its closest permutation $\pi^*$ in $C_n$, if the Ulam distance of $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ is less than $ \frac{(1-\varepsilon)\cdot n}{4} $.
  Previously, it was implicitly known by combining works of Goldreich and Wigderson [Israel Journal of Mathematics'23] and Farnoud, Skachek, and Milenkovic [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'13] in a black-box manner, that it is possible to explicitly construct $(n!)^{\Omega(1)}$ many permutations on $[n]$, such that every pair of them have pairwise Ulam distance at least $\frac{n}{6}\cdot (1-\varepsilon)$, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and the bound on the distance can be improved to $\frac{n}{4}\cdot (1-\varepsilon)$ if the construction of Goldreich and Wigderson is directly analyzed in the Ulam metric.</description>

      <title>On Iiro Honkala's contributions to identifying codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $C$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an identifying code if it is dominating and any two vertices of $V$ are dominated by distinct sets of codewords. This paper presents a survey of Iiro Honkala's contributions to the study of identifying codes with respect to several aspects: complexity of computing an identifying code, combinatorics in binary Hamming spaces, infinite grids, relationships between identifying codes and usual parameters in graphs, structural properties of graphs admitting identifying codes, and number of optimal identifying codes.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of Lie algebras associated with graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a canonical decomposition of the cohomology of the Dani-Mainkar metabelian Lie algebras associated with graphs. As applications, we obtain explicit formulas for the third cohomology of any Dani-Mainkar Lie algebra and for the cohomology in all degrees of Lie algebras associated with arbitrary star graphs. We also describe a procedure to reduce the calculation of the cohomology of solvable Lie algebras associated with graphs through the Grantcharov-Grantcharov-Iliev construction to the cohomology of Dani-Mainkar Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Whittaker vectors at finite energy scale, topological recursion and Hurwitz numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in at least two different ways, Hurwitz numbers, quantum curves, and (almost complete) description of the correlators as analytic functions of $\hbar$ (instead of formal series). The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.</description>

      <title>The distribution on permutations induced by a random parking function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution. Let $P_n^{\text{park}}$ denote this distribution on $S_n$ and let $P_n$ denote the uniform distribution on $S_n$. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in S_n$. Then we show that for all but an asymptotically $P_n$-negligible set of permutations, one has $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)\in\left(\frac{(2-\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}},\frac{(2+\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}}\right)$. However, this accounts for only an exponentially small part of the $P_n^{\text{park}}$-probability. We also obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+1}=i_1,\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2}=i_2,\cdots, \sigma^{-1}_n=i_j)$, the probability that the last $j$ cars park in positions $i_1,\cdots, i_j$ respectively, and show that the $j$-dimensional random vector $(n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+l}, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2},\cdots, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n})$ under $P_n^{\text{park}}$ converges in distribution to a random vector $(\sum_{r=1}^jX_r,\sum_{r=2}^j X_r,\cdots, X_{j-1}+X_j,X_j)$, where $\{X_r\}_{r=1}^j$ are IID with the Borel distribution. We then show that in fact for $j_n=o(n^\frac16)$, the final $j_n$ cars will park in increasing order with probability approaching 1 as $n\to\infty$.</description>
