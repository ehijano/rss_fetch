      <title>Deep operator network models for predicting post-burn contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burn injuries present a significant global health challenge. Among the most severe long-term consequences are contractures, which can lead to functional impairments and disfigurement. Understanding and predicting the evolution of post-burn wounds is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Traditional mathematical models, while accurate, are often computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their practical application. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, offer promising alternatives for accelerating these predictions. This study explores the use of a deep operator network (DeepONet), a type of neural operator, as a surrogate model for finite element simulations, aimed at predicting post-burn contraction across multiple wound shapes. A DeepONet was trained on three distinct initial wound shapes, with enhancement made to the architecture by incorporating initial wound shape information and applying sine augmentation to enforce boundary conditions. The performance of the trained DeepONet was evaluated on a test set including finite element simulations based on convex combinations of the three basic wound shapes. The model achieved an $R^2$ score of $0.99$, indicating strong predictive accuracy and generalization. Moreover, the model provided reliable predictions over an extended period of up to one year, with speedups of up to 128-fold on CPU and 235-fold on GPU, compared to the numerical model. These findings suggest that DeepONets can effectively serve as a surrogate for traditional finite element methods in simulating post-burn wound evolution, with potential applications in medical treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Considerations and Recommendations from the ISMRM Diffusion Study Group for preclinical diffusion MRI: Part 1 -- In vivo small-animal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12994</link>

Abstract: Small-animal diffusion MRI (dMRI) has been used for methodological development and validation, characterizing the biological basis of diffusion phenomena, and comparative anatomy. The steps from animal setup and monitoring, to acquisition, analysis, and interpretation are complex, with many decisions that may ultimately affect what questions can be answered using the resultant data. This work aims to present selected recommendations and guidelines from the diffusion community, on best practices for preclinical dMRI of in vivo animals. We describe the general considerations and foundational knowledge that must be considered when designing experiments. We briefly describe differences in animal species and disease models and discuss why some may be more or less appropriate for different studies. We then give guidelines for in vivo acquisition protocols, including decisions on hardware, animal preparation, and imaging sequences, followed by advice for data processing including pre-processing, model-fitting, and tractography. Finally, we provide an online resource which lists publicly available preclinical dMRI datasets and software packages, to promote responsible and reproducible research. In each section, we attempt to provide guides and recommendations, but also highlight areas for which no guidelines exist (and why), and where future work should focus. While we mainly cover the central nervous system (on which most preclinical dMRI studies are focused), we also provide, where possible and applicable, recommendations for other organs of interest. An overarching goal herein is to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of small animal dMRI acquisitions and analyses, and thereby advance biomedical knowledge.</description>
