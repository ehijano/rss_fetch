      <title>P4Control: Line-Rate Cross-Host Attack Prevention via In-Network Information Flow Control Enabled by Programmable Switches and eBPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern targeted attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats use multiple hosts as stepping stones and move laterally across them to gain deeper access to the network. However, existing defenses lack end-to-end information flow visibility across hosts and cannot block cross-host attack traffic in real time. In this paper, we propose P4Control, a network defense system that precisely confines end-to-end information flows in a network and prevents cross-host attacks at line rate. P4Control introduces a novel in-network decentralized information flow control (DIFC) mechanism and is the first work that enforces DIFC at the network level at network line rate. This is achieved through: (1) an in-network primitive based on programmable switches for tracking inter-host information flows and enforcing line-rate DIFC policies; (2) a lightweight eBPF-based primitive deployed on hosts for tracking intra-host information flows. P4Control also provides an expressive policy framework for specifying DIFC policies against different attack scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations to show that P4Control can effectively prevent cross-host attacks in real time, while maintaining line-rate network performance and imposing minimal overhead on the network and host machines. It is also noteworthy that P4Control can facilitate the realization of a zero trust architecture through its fine-grained least-privilege network access control.</description>

      <title>Surveilling the Masses with Wi-Fi-Based Positioning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi-based Positioning Systems (WPSes) are used by modern mobile devices to learn their position using nearby Wi-Fi access points as landmarks. In this work, we show that Apple's WPS can be abused to create a privacy threat on a global scale. We present an attack that allows an unprivileged attacker to amass a worldwide snapshot of Wi-Fi BSSID geolocations in only a matter of days. Our attack makes few assumptions, merely exploiting the fact that there are relatively few dense regions of allocated MAC address space. Applying this technique over the course of a year, we learned the precise locations of over 2 billion BSSIDs around the world.
  The privacy implications of such massive datasets become more stark when taken longitudinally, allowing the attacker to track devices' movements. While most Wi-Fi access points do not move for long periods of time, many devices -- like compact travel routers -- are specifically designed to be mobile. We present several case studies that demonstrate the types of attacks on privacy that Apple's WPS enables: We track devices moving in and out of war zones (specifically Ukraine and Gaza), the effects of natural disasters (specifically the fires in Maui), and the possibility of targeted individual tracking by proxy -- all by remotely geolocating wireless access points. We provide recommendations to WPS operators and Wi-Fi access point manufacturers to enhance the privacy of hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Finally, we detail our efforts at responsibly disclosing this privacy vulnerability, and outline some mitigations that Apple and Wi-Fi access point manufacturers have implemented both independently and as a result of our work.</description>

      <title>SoK: A Defense-Oriented Evaluation of Software Supply Chain Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software supply chain comprises a highly complex set of operations, processes, tools, institutions and human factors involved in creating a piece of software. A number of high-profile attacks that exploit a weakness in this complex ecosystem have spurred research in identifying classes of supply chain attacks. Yet, practitioners often lack the necessary information to understand their security posture and implement suitable defenses against these attacks. We argue that the next stage of software supply chain security research and development will benefit greatly from a defense-oriented approach that focuses on holistic bottom-up solutions. To this end, this paper introduces the AStRA model, a framework for representing fundamental software supply chain elements and their causal relationships. Using this model, we identify software supply chain security objectives that are needed to mitigate common attacks and systematize knowledge on recent and well-established security techniques for their ability to meet these objectives. We validate our model against prior attacks and taxonomies. Finally, we identify emergent research gaps and propose opportunities to develop novel software development tools and systems that are secure-by-design.</description>

      <title>Targeted Nakamoto: A Bitcoin Protocol to Balance Network Security and Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Proof-of-Work blockchain such as Bitcoin mining hashrate is increasing in the block reward. An increase in hashrate reduces network vulnerability to attack (a reduction in security cost) while increasing carbon emissions and electricity cost (an increase in externalities cost). This implies a tradeoff in total cost at different levels of hashrate and the existence of a hashrate interval where total cost is minimized. Targeted Nakamoto is a Proof-of-Work protocol augmentation that incentivizes miners to hone in on a target hashrate interval. When hashrate is above target a ceiling is placed on the block reward a miner can receive. When hashrate is below target a floor is placed underneath the miner's block reward. Monetary neutrality is maintained by a proportional increase in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match a deduction from total block reward when the ceiling is operative and a proportional reduction in spending potential among addresses holding UTXO's to match an increase over the total block reward when the floor is binding.</description>

      <title>Are You Copying My Prompt? Protecting the Copyright of Vision Prompt for VPaaS via Watermark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Prompt Learning (VPL) differs from traditional fine-tuning methods in reducing significant resource consumption by avoiding updating pre-trained model parameters. Instead, it focuses on learning an input perturbation, a visual prompt, added to downstream task data for making predictions. Since learning generalizable prompts requires expert design and creation, which is technically demanding and time-consuming in the optimization process, developers of Visual Prompts as a Service (VPaaS) have emerged. These developers profit by providing well-crafted prompts to authorized customers. However, a significant drawback is that prompts can be easily copied and redistributed, threatening the intellectual property of VPaaS developers. Hence, there is an urgent need for technology to protect the rights of VPaaS developers. To this end, we present a method named \textbf{WVPrompt} that employs visual prompt watermarking in a black-box way. WVPrompt consists of two parts: prompt watermarking and prompt verification. Specifically, it utilizes a poison-only backdoor attack method to embed a watermark into the prompt and then employs a hypothesis-testing approach for remote verification of prompt ownership. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three well-known benchmark datasets using three popular pre-trained models: RN50, BIT-M, and Instagram. The experimental results demonstrate that WVPrompt is efficient, harmless, and robust to various adversarial operations.</description>

      <title>RFLPA: A Robust Federated Learning Framework against Poisoning Attacks with Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple devices to train a model collaboratively without sharing their data. Despite its benefits, FL is vulnerable to privacy leakage and poisoning attacks. To address the privacy concern, secure aggregation (SecAgg) is often used to obtain the aggregation of gradients on sever without inspecting individual user updates. Unfortunately, existing defense strategies against poisoning attacks rely on the analysis of local updates in plaintext, making them incompatible with SecAgg. To reconcile the conflicts, we propose a robust federated learning framework against poisoning attacks (RFLPA) based on SecAgg protocol. Our framework computes the cosine similarity between local updates and server updates to conduct robust aggregation. Furthermore, we leverage verifiable packed Shamir secret sharing to achieve reduced communication cost of $O(M+N)$ per user, and design a novel dot-product aggregation algorithm to resolve the issue of increased information leakage. Our experimental results show that RFLPA significantly reduces communication and computation overhead by over $75\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art method, BREA, while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description>

      <title>TrojanForge: Adversarial Hardware Trojan Examples with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hardware Trojan (HT) problem can be thought of as a continuous game between attackers and defenders, each striving to outsmart the other by leveraging any available means for an advantage. Machine Learning (ML) has recently been key in advancing HT research. Various novel techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown HT insertion and detection capabilities. HT insertion with ML techniques, specifically, has seen a spike in research activity due to the shortcomings of conventional HT benchmarks and the inherent human design bias that occurs when we create them. This work continues this innovation by presenting a tool called "TrojanForge", capable of generating HT adversarial examples that defeat HT detectors; demonstrating the capabilities of GAN-like adversarial tools for automatic HT insertion. We introduce an RL environment where the RL insertion agent interacts with HT detectors in an insertion-detection loop where the agent collects rewards based on its success in bypassing HT detectors. Our results show that this process leads to inserted HTs that evade various HT detectors, achieving high attack success percentages. This tool provides insight into why HT insertion fails in some instances and how we can leverage this knowledge in defense.</description>

      <title>A Simple Solution for Homomorphic Evaluation on Large Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a promising technique used for privacy-preserving computation. Since HE schemes only support primitive polynomial operations, homomorphic evaluation of polynomial approximations for non-polynomial functions plays an important role in privacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a simple solution to approximating any functions, which might be overmissed by researchers: just using the neural networks for regressions. By searching decent superparameters, neural networks can achieve near-optimal computation depth for a given function with fixed precision, thereby reducing the modulus consumed.
  There are three main reasons why we choose neural networks for homomorphic evaluation of polynomial approximations. Firstly, neural networks with polynomial activation functions can be used to approximate whatever functions are needed in an encrypted state. This means that we can compute by one unified process for any polynomial approximation, such as that of Sigmoid or of ReLU. Secondly, by carefully finding an appropriate architecture, neural networks can efficiently evaluate a polynomial using near-optimal multiplicative depth, which would consume less modulus and therefore employ less ciphertext refreshing. Finally, as popular tools, model neural networks have many well-studied techniques that can conveniently serve our solution.
  Experiments showed that our method can be used for approximation of various functions. We exploit our method to the evaluation of the Sigmoid function on large intervals $[-30, +30]$, $[-50, +50]$, and $[-70, +70]$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Leakage-Resilient and Carbon-Neutral Aggregation Featuring the Federated AI-enabled Critical Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-enabled critical infrastructures (ACIs) integrate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into various essential systems and services that are vital to the functioning of society, offering significant implications for efficiency, security and resilience. While adopting decentralized AI approaches (such as federated learning technology) in ACIs is plausible, private and sensitive data are still susceptible to data reconstruction attacks through gradient optimization. In this work, we propose Compressed Differentially Private Aggregation (CDPA), a leakage-resilient, communication-efficient, and carbon-neutral approach for ACI networks. Specifically, CDPA has introduced a novel random bit-flipping mechanism as its primary innovation. This mechanism first converts gradients into a specific binary representation and then selectively flips masked bits with a certain probability. The proposed bit-flipping introduces a larger variance to the noise while providing differentially private protection and commendable efforts in energy savings while applying vector quantization techniques within the context of federated learning. The experimental evaluation indicates that CDPA can reduce communication cost by half while preserving model utility. Moreover, we demonstrate that CDPA can effectively defend against state-of-the-art data reconstruction attacks in both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. We highlight existing benchmarks that generate 2.6x to over 100x more carbon emissions than CDPA. We hope that the CDPA developed in this paper can inform the federated AI-enabled critical infrastructure of a more balanced trade-off between utility and privacy, resilience protection, as well as a better carbon offset with less communication overhead.</description>

      <title>The Writing is on the Wall: Analyzing the Boom of Inscriptions and its Impact on EVM-compatible Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the level of attention given to rollups there is limited empirical research about their performance. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the late 2023 transaction boom that is attributed to inscriptions: a novel approach to record data onto a blockchain with no outside server needed. Inscriptions were first introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain to allow for the representation of NFTs or ERC-20-like tokens without smart contracts, but were later spread to other blockchains.
  This work examines the applications of inscription transactions in Ethereum and its major EVM-compatible rollups and their impact on blockchain scalability during periods of sudden transaction surges. We found that on certain days, inscription-related transactions comprised over 89% on Arbitrum, over 88% on zkSync Era, and over 53% on Ethereum. Furthermore, 99% of these transactions were related to the minting of meme coins, followed by limited trading activity. Unlike L1 blockchains, during periods of transaction surges, zkSync and Arbitrum experienced lower median gas fees, attributable to the compression of L2 transactions for a single L1 batch. Additionally, zkSync Era, a ZK rollup, demonstrated a stronger reduction in fees than optimistic rollups considered in our study: Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism.</description>

      <title>Transaction Fee Estimation in the Bitcoin System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Bitcoin system, transaction fees serve as an incentive for blockchain confirmations. In general, a transaction with a higher fee is likely to be included in the next block mined, whereas a transaction with a smaller fee or no fee may be delayed or never processed at all. However, the transaction fee needs to be specified when submitting a transaction and almost cannot be altered thereafter. Hence it is indispensable to help a client set a reasonable fee, as a higher fee incurs over-spending and a lower fee could delay the confirmation. In this work, we focus on estimating the transaction fee for a new transaction to help with its confirmation within a given expected time. We identify two major drawbacks in the existing works. First, the current industry products are built on explicit analytical models, ignoring the complex interactions of different factors which could be better captured by machine learning based methods; Second, all of the existing works utilize limited knowledge for the estimation which hinders the potential of further improving the estimation quality. As a result, we propose a framework FENN, which aims to integrate the knowledge from a wide range of sources, including the transaction itself, unconfirmed transactions in the mempool and the blockchain confirmation environment, into a neural network model in order to estimate a proper transaction fee. Finally, we conduct experiments on real blockchain datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-art works evaluated by MAPE and RMSE. Each variation model in our framework can finish training within one block interval, which shows the potential of our framework to process the realtime transaction updates in the Bitcoin blockchain.</description>

      <title>Nudging Users to Change Breached Passwords Using the Protection Motivation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We draw on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to design nudges that encourage users to change breached passwords. Our online experiment ($n$=$1,386$) compared the effectiveness of a threat appeal (highlighting negative consequences of breached passwords) and a coping appeal (providing instructions on how to change the breached password) in a 2x2 factorial design. Compared to the control condition, participants receiving the threat appeal were more likely to intend to change their passwords, and participants receiving both appeals were more likely to end up changing their passwords; both comparisons have a small effect size. Participants' password change behaviors are further associated with other factors such as their security attitudes (SA-6) and time passed since the breach, suggesting that PMT-based nudges are useful but insufficient to fully motivate users to change their passwords. Our study contributes to PMT's application in security research and provides concrete design implications for improving compromised credential notifications.</description>

      <title>Dishonest Approximate Computing: A Coming Crisis for Cloud Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Computing (AC) has emerged as a promising technique for achieving energy-efficient architectures and is expected to become an effective technique for reducing the electricity cost for cloud service providers (CSP). However, the potential misuse of AC has not received adequate attention, which is a coming crisis behind the blueprint of AC. Driven by the pursuit of illegal financial profits, untrusted CSPs may deploy low-cost AC devices and deceive clients by presenting AC services as promised accurate computing products, while falsely claiming AC outputs as accurate results. This misuse of AC will cause both financial loss and computing degradation to cloud clients. In this paper, we define this malicious attack as DisHonest Approximate Computing (DHAC) and analyze the technical challenges faced by clients in detecting such attacks. To address this issue, we propose two golden model free detection methods: Residual Class Check (RCC) and Forward-Backward Check (FBC). RCC provides clients a low-cost approach to infer the residual class to which a legitimate accurate output should belong. By comparing the residual class of the returned result, clients can determine whether a computing service contains any AC elements. FBC detects potential DHAC by computing an invertible check branch using the intermediate values of the program. It compares the values before entering and after returning from the check branch to identify any discrepancies. Both RCC and FBC can be executed concurrently with real computing tasks, enabling real-time DHAC detection with current inputs. Our experimental results show that both RCC and FBC can detect over 96%-99% of DHAC cases without misjudging any legitimate accurate results.</description>

      <title>Implementation of New Security Features in CMSWEB Kubernetes Cluster at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CMSWEB cluster is pivotal to the activities of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, as it hosts critical services required for the operational needs of the CMS experiment. The security of these services and the corresponding data is crucial to CMS. Any malicious attack can compromise the availability of our services. Therefore, it is important to construct a robust security infrastructure. In this work, we discuss new security features introduced to the CMSWEB Kubernetes ("k8s") cluster. The new features include the implementation of network policies, deployment of Open Policy Agent (OPA), enforcement of OPA policies, and the integration of Vault. The network policies act as an inside-the-cluster firewall to limit the network communication between the pods to the minimum necessary, and its dynamic nature allows us to work with microservices. The OPA validates the objects against some custom-defined policies during create, update, and delete operations to further enhance security. Without recompiling or changing the configuration of the Kubernetes API server, it can apply customized policies on Kubernetes objects and their audit functionality enabling us to detect pre-existing conflicts and issues. Although Kubernetes incorporates the concepts of secrets, they are only base64 encoded and are not dynamically configured. This is where Vault comes into play: Vault dynamically secures, stores, and tightly controls access to sensitive data. This way, the secret information is encrypted, secured, and centralized, making it more scalable and easier to manage. Thus, the implementation of these three security features corroborate the enhanced security and reliability of the CMSWEB Kubernetes infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: Model stealing, i.e., unauthorized access and exfiltration of deep learning models, has become one of the major threats. Proprietary models may be protected by access controls and encryption. However, in reality, these measures can be compromised due to system breaches, query-based model extraction or a disgruntled insider. Security hardening of neural networks is also suffering from limits, for example, model watermarking is passive, cannot prevent the occurrence of piracy and not robust against transformations. To this end, we propose a native authentication mechanism, called AuthNet, which integrates authentication logic as part of the model without any additional structures. Our key insight is to reuse redundant neurons with low activation and embed authentication bits in an intermediate layer, called a gate layer. Then, AuthNet fine-tunes the layers after the gate layer to embed authentication logic so that only inputs with special secret key can trigger the correct logic of AuthNet. It exhibits two intuitive advantages. It provides the last line of defense, i.e., even being exfiltrated, the model is not usable as the adversary cannot generate valid inputs without the key. Moreover, the authentication logic is difficult to inspect and identify given millions or billions of neurons in the model. We theoretically demonstrate the high sensitivity of AuthNet to the secret key and its high confusion for unauthorized samples. AuthNet is compatible with any convolutional neural network, where our extensive evaluations show that AuthNet successfully achieves the goal in rejecting unauthenticated users (whose average accuracy drops to 22.03%) with a trivial accuracy decrease (1.18% on average) for legitimate users, and is robust against model transformation and adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Do Not Trust Power Management: Challenges and Hints for Securing Future Trusted Execution Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, several research groups have introduced innovative hardware designs for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), aiming to secure applications against potentially compromised privileged software, including the kernel. Since 2017, Tang et al. introduced a new class of software-enabled hardware attacks, which leverages energy management mechanisms. These attacks aim at bypassing TEE security guarantees and exposing sensitive information like cryptographic keys. They have increased in prevalence over the past few years. Despite that, current RISC-V TEE architectures have yet to incorporate them into their threat models. Proprietary implementations, such as Arm TrustZone and Intel SGX, embed countermeasures. However, these countermeasures are not viable in the long term and hinder the capabilities of energy management mechanisms. This article presents the first comprehensive knowledge survey of these attacks, along with an evaluation of literature countermeasures. Our analysis highlights a substantial security gap between assumed threat models and the actual ones, presenting considerable threats in modern systems-on-chip that can undermine even the security guarantees provided by TEEs. We advocate for the enhancement of the next generation of RISC-V TEEs to address these attacks within their threat models, and we believe this study will spur further community efforts in this direction.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Large Language Models for Software Vulnerability Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite various approaches being employed to detect vulnerabilities, the number of reported vulnerabilities shows an upward trend over the years. This suggests the problems are not caught before the code is released, which could be caused by many factors, like lack of awareness, limited efficacy of the existing vulnerability detection tools or the tools not being user-friendly. To help combat some issues with traditional vulnerability detection tools, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to assist in finding vulnerabilities in source code. LLMs have shown a remarkable ability to understand and generate code, underlining their potential in code-related tasks. The aim is to test multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and identify the best prompting strategies, allowing extraction of the best value from the LLMs. We provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the LLM-based approach and compare the results to those of traditional static analysis tools. We find that LLMs can pinpoint many more issues than traditional static analysis tools, outperforming traditional tools in terms of recall and F1 scores. The results should benefit software developers and security analysts responsible for ensuring that the code is free of vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>$$\mathbf{L^2\cdot M = C^2}$$ Large Language Models as Covert Channels... a Systematic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity in the last few years due to their performance in diverse tasks such as translation, prediction, or content generation. At the same time, the research community has shown that LLMs are susceptible to various attacks but can also improve the security of diverse systems. However, besides enabling more secure systems, how well do open source LLMs behave as covertext distributions to, e.g., facilitate censorship resistant communication?
  In this paper, we explore the capabilities of open-source LLM-based covert channels. We approach this problem from the experimental side by empirically measuring the security vs. capacity of the open-source LLM model (Llama-7B) to assess how well it performs as a covert channel. Although our results indicate that such channels are not likely to achieve high practical bitrates, which depend on message length and model entropy, we also show that the chance for an adversary to detect covert communication is low. To ensure that our results can be used with the least effort as a general reference, we employ a conceptually simple and concise scheme and only assume public models.</description>

      <title>Data Reconstruction: When You See It and When You Don't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamental question of formally defining what constitutes a reconstruction attack. While often clear from the context, our exploration reveals that a precise definition is much more nuanced than it appears, to the extent that a single all-encompassing definition may not exist. Thus, we employ a different strategy and aim to "sandwich" the concept of reconstruction attacks by addressing two complementing questions: (i) What conditions guarantee that a given system is protected against such attacks? (ii) Under what circumstances does a given attack clearly indicate that a system is not protected? More specifically,
  * We introduce a new definitional paradigm -- Narcissus Resiliency -- to formulate a security definition for protection against reconstruction attacks. This paradigm has a self-referential nature that enables it to circumvent shortcomings of previously studied notions of security. Furthermore, as a side-effect, we demonstrate that Narcissus resiliency captures as special cases multiple well-studied concepts including differential privacy and other security notions of one-way functions and encryption schemes.
  * We formulate a link between reconstruction attacks and Kolmogorov complexity. This allows us to put forward a criterion for evaluating when such attacks are convincingly successful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconditional security in quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on authenticating the identities of users involved in key distribution. While classical identity authentication schemes were initially utilized in QKD implementations, concerns regarding their vulnerability have prompted the exploration of quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols. In this study, we introduce a new protocol for QIA, derived from the concept of controlled secure direct quantum communication. Our proposed scheme facilitates simultaneous authentication between two users, Alice and Bob, leveraging Bell states with the assistance of a third party, Charlie. Through rigorous security analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol withstands various known attacks, including impersonation, intercept and resend and impersonated fraudulent attacks. Additionally, we establish the relevance of the proposed protocol by comparing it with the existing protocols of similar type.</description>

      <title>Cross-Task Defense: Instruction-Tuning LLMs for Content Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal that Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in balancing safety with utility, particularly when processing long texts for NLP tasks like summarization and translation. Despite defenses against malicious short questions, the ability of LLMs to safely handle dangerous long content, such as manuals teaching illicit activities, remains unclear. Our work aims to develop robust defenses for LLMs in processing malicious documents alongside benign NLP task queries. We introduce a defense dataset comprised of safety-related examples and propose single-task and mixed-task losses for instruction tuning. Our empirical results demonstrate that LLMs can significantly enhance their capacity to safely manage dangerous content with appropriate instruction tuning. Additionally, strengthening the defenses of tasks most susceptible to misuse is effective in protecting LLMs against processing harmful information. We also observe that trade-offs between utility and safety exist in defense strategies, where Llama2, utilizing our proposed approach, displays a significantly better balance compared to Llama1.</description>

      <title>Defensive Unlearning with Adversarial Training for Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, but they also pose safety risks, such as the potential generation of harmful content and copyright violations. The techniques of machine unlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these risks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images containing concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to enhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of adversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust unlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this effectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a straightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs' image generation quality post-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization on an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure robustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text encoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet, ensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a plug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn across various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity, objects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also achieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore robust DM unlearning through AT, setting it apart from existing methods that overlook robustness in concept erasing.

      <title>Decaf: Data Distribution Decompose Attack against Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to prevalent Federated Learning (FL) privacy inference techniques such as generative adversarial networks attacks, membership inference attacks, property inference attacks, and model inversion attacks, we devise an innovative privacy threat: the Data Distribution Decompose Attack on FL, termed Decaf. This attack enables an honest-but-curious FL server to meticulously profile the proportion of each class owned by the victim FL user, divulging sensitive information like local market item distribution and business competitiveness. The crux of Decaf lies in the profound observation that the magnitude of local model gradient changes closely mirrors the underlying data distribution, including the proportion of each class. Decaf addresses two crucial challenges: accurately identify the missing/null class(es) given by any victim user as a premise and then quantify the precise relationship between gradient changes and each remaining non-null class. Notably, Decaf operates stealthily, rendering it entirely passive and undetectable to victim users regarding the infringement of their data distribution privacy. Experimental validation on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, CIFAR-10, FER-2013, and SkinCancer) employing diverse model architectures, including customized convolutional networks, standardized VGG16, and ResNet18, demonstrates Decaf's efficacy. Results indicate its ability to accurately decompose local user data distribution, regardless of whether it is IID or non-IID distributed. Specifically, the dissimilarity measured using $L_{\infty}$ distance between the distribution decomposed by Decaf and ground truth is consistently below 5\% when no null classes exist. Moreover, Decaf achieves 100\% accuracy in determining any victim user's null classes, validated through formal proof.</description>

      <title>Lost in the Averages: A New Specific Setup to Evaluate Membership Inference Attacks Against Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used to evaluate the propensity of a machine learning (ML) model to memorize an individual record and the privacy risk releasing the model poses. MIAs are commonly evaluated similarly to ML models: the MIA is performed on a test set of models trained on datasets unseen during training, which are sampled from a larger pool, $D_{eval}$. The MIA is evaluated across all datasets in this test set, and is thus evaluated across the distribution of samples from $D_{eval}$. While this was a natural extension of ML evaluation to MIAs, recent work has shown that a record's risk heavily depends on its specific dataset. For example, outliers are particularly vulnerable, yet an outlier in one dataset may not be one in another. The sources of randomness currently used to evaluate MIAs may thus lead to inaccurate individual privacy risk estimates. We propose a new, specific evaluation setup for MIAs against ML models, using weight initialization as the sole source of randomness. This allows us to accurately evaluate the risk associated with the release of a model trained on a specific dataset. Using SOTA MIAs, we empirically show that the risk estimates given by the current setup lead to many records being misclassified as low risk. We derive theoretical results which, combined with empirical evidence, suggest that the risk calculated in the current setup is an average of the risks specific to each sampled dataset, validating our use of weight initialization as the only source of randomness. Finally, we consider an MIA with a stronger adversary leveraging information about the target dataset to infer membership. Taken together, our results show that current MIA evaluation is averaging the risk across datasets leading to inaccurate risk estimates, and the risk posed by attacks leveraging information about the target dataset to be potentially underestimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been shown vulnerable to retrieval corruption attacks: an attacker can inject malicious passages into retrieval results to induce inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose RobustRAG as the first defense framework against retrieval corruption attacks. The key insight of RobustRAG is an isolate-then-aggregate strategy: we get LLM responses from each passage in isolation and then securely aggregate these isolated responses. To instantiate RobustRAG, we design keyword-based and decoding-based algorithms for securely aggregating unstructured text responses. Notably, RobustRAG can achieve certifiable robustness: we can formally prove and certify that, for certain queries, RobustRAG can always return accurate responses, even when the attacker has full knowledge of our defense and can arbitrarily inject a small number of malicious passages. We evaluate RobustRAG on open-domain QA and long-form text generation datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability across various tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adversarial Training in LLMs with Continuous Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can bypass their safety guardrails. In many domains, adversarial training has proven to be one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against such attacks. Yet, in the context of LLMs, current methods for adversarial training are hindered by the high computational costs required to perform discrete adversarial attacks at each training iteration. We address this problem by instead calculating adversarial attacks in the continuous embedding space of the LLM, which is orders of magnitudes more efficient. We propose a fast adversarial training algorithm (C-AdvUL) composed of two losses: the first makes the model robust on continuous embedding attacks computed on an adversarial behaviour dataset; the second ensures the usefulness of the final model by fine-tuning on utility data. Moreover, we introduce C-AdvIPO, an adversarial variant of IPO that does not require utility data for adversarially robust alignment. Our empirical evaluation on four models from different families (Gemma, Phi3, Mistral, Zephyr) and at different scales (2B, 3.8B, 7B) shows that both algorithms substantially enhance LLM robustness against discrete attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR), while maintaining utility. Our results demonstrate that robustness to continuous perturbations can extrapolate to discrete threat models. Thereby, we present a path toward scalable adversarial training algorithms for robustly aligning LLMs.</description>

      <title>Single-Round Proofs of Quantumness from Knowledge Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proof of quantumness is an efficiently verifiable interactive test that an efficient quantum computer can pass, but all efficient classical computers cannot (under some cryptographic assumption). Such protocols play a crucial role in the certification of quantum devices. Existing single-round protocols (like asking the quantum computer to factor a large number) require large quantum circuits, whereas multi-round ones use smaller circuits but require experimentally challenging mid-circuit measurements. As such, current proofs of quantumness are out of reach for near-term devices.
  In this work, we construct efficient single-round proofs of quantumness based on existing knowledge assumptions. While knowledge assumptions have not been previously considered in this context, we show that they provide a natural basis for separating classical and quantum computation. Specifically, we show that multi-round protocols based on Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) or Learning With Errors (LWE) can be "compiled" into single-round protocols using a knowledge-of-exponent assumption or knowledge-of-lattice-point assumption, respectively. We also prove an adaptive hardcore-bit statement for a family of claw-free functions based on DDH, which might be of independent interest.
  Previous approaches to constructing single-round protocols relied on the random oracle model and thus incurred the overhead associated with instantiating the oracle with a cryptographic hash function. In contrast, our protocols have the same resource requirements as their multi-round counterparts without necessitating mid-circuit measurements, making them, arguably, the most efficient single-round proofs of quantumness to date. Our work also helps in understanding the interplay between black-box/white-box reductions and cryptographic assumptions in the design of proofs of quantumness.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Runtime Wi-Fi MAC Address Re-randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) address randomization is a key component for privacy protection in Wi-Fi networks. Current proposals periodically change the mobile device MAC addresses when it disconnects from the Access Point (AP). This way frames cannot be linked across changes, but the mobile device presence is exposed as long as it remains connected: all its communication is trivially linkable by observing the randomized yet same MAC address throughout the connection. Our runtime MAC re-randomization scheme addresses this issue, reducing or eliminating Wi-Fi frames linkability without awaiting for or requiring a disconnection. Our MAC re-randomization is practically 'over-the-air': MAC addresses are re-randomized just before transmission, while the protocol stacks (at the mobile and the AP) maintain locally the original connection MAC addresses - making our MAC layer scheme transparent to upper layers. With an implementation and a set of small-scale experiments with off-the-shelf devices, we show the feasibility of our scheme and the potential towards future deployment.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Access Control for IoT -- A Blockchain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates robust access control mechanisms to secure a vast array of interconnected devices. Most of the existing IoT systems in practice use centralized solutions. We identify the problems in such solutions and adopt the blockchain based decentralized access control approach. Though there are works in the literature that use blockchain for access control, there are some gaps in these works. We develop a blockchain embedded access control (BEAC) framework to bridge the gaps. First, blockchain based solutions for access control require an enabling P2P network while existing P2P overlays do not support some required features. We develop a novel P2P infrastructure to seamlessly support our BEAC framework. Second, most of the works consider blockchain based access control for a single access control model, and we develop a generic blockchain mechanism and show that it can support the embedding of various access control models. Finally, existing works adopt existing blockchain mechanisms which may incur a high communication overhead. We develop a shortcut approach to improve the number of message rounds in the access protocol. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our system, showing that the shortcut mechanism can reduces access time by approximately 43%.</description>

      <title>GOTCHA: Real-Time Video Deepfake Detection via Challenge-Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of AI-enabled Real-Time Deepfakes (RTDFs), the integrity of online video interactions has become a growing concern. RTDFs have now made it feasible to replace an imposter's face with their victim in live video interactions. Such advancement in deepfakes also coaxes detection to rise to the same standard. However, existing deepfake detection techniques are asynchronous and hence ill-suited for RTDFs. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenge-response approach that establishes authenticity in live settings. We focus on talking-head style video interaction and present a taxonomy of challenges that specifically target inherent limitations of RTDF generation pipelines. We evaluate representative examples from the taxonomy by collecting a unique dataset comprising eight challenges, which consistently and visibly degrades the quality of state-of-the-art deepfake generators. These results are corroborated both by humans and a new automated scoring function, leading to 88.6% and 80.1% AUC, respectively. The findings underscore the promising potential of challenge-response systems for explainable and scalable real-time deepfake detection in practical scenarios. We provide access to data and code at \url{https://github.com/mittalgovind/GOTCHA-Deepfakes}.</description>

      <title>Can sparsity improve the privacy of neural networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse neural networks are mainly motivated by ressource efficiency since they use fewer parameters than their dense counterparts but still reach comparable accuracies. This article empirically investigates whether sparsity could also improve the privacy of the data used to train the networks. The experiments show positive correlations between the sparsity of the model, its privacy, and its classification error. Simply comparing the privacy of two models with different sparsity levels can yield misleading conclusions on the role of sparsity, because of the additional correlation with the classification error. From this perspective, some caveats are raised about previous works that investigate sparsity and privacy.</description>

      <title>SeDe: Balancing Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance by Selective De-Anonymization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy is one of the essential pillars for the widespread adoption of blockchains, but public blockchains are transparent by nature. Modern analytics techniques can easily subdue the pseudonymity feature of a blockchain user. Some applications have been able to provide practical privacy protections using privacy-preserving cryptography techniques. However, malicious actors have abused them illicitly, discouraging honest actors from using privacy-preserving applications as "mixing" user interactions and funds with anonymous bad actors, causing compliance and regulatory concerns.
  In this paper, we propose a framework that balances privacy-preserving features by establishing a regulatory and compliant framework called Selective De-Anonymization (SeDe). The adoption of this framework allows privacy-preserving applications on blockchains to de-anonymize illicit transactions by recursive traversal of subgraphs of linked transactions. Our technique achieves this without leaving de-anonymization decisions or control in the hands of a single entity but distributing it among multiple entities while holding them accountable for their respective actions. To instantiate, our framework uses threshold encryption schemes and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).</description>

Abstract: Airdrops are used by blockchain applications and protocols to attract an initial user base, and to grow the user base over time. In the case of many airdrops, tokens are distributed to select users as a "reward" for interacting with the underlying protocol, with a long-term goal of creating a loyal community that will generate genuine economic activity well after the airdrop. Although airdrops are widely used by the blockchain industry, a proper understanding of the factors contributing to an airdrop's success is generally lacking. In this work, we outline the design space for airdrops, and specify a reasonable list of outcomes that an airdrop should ideally result in. We then analyze on-chain data from several larger-scale airdrops to empirically evaluate the success of previous airdrops, with respect to our desiderata. In our analysis, we demonstrate that airdrop farmers frequently dispose of the lion's share of airdrops proceeds via exchanges. Our analysis is followed by an overview of common pitfalls that common airdrop designs lend themselves to, which are then used to suggest concrete guidelines for better airdrops.</description>

      <title>ConfusionPrompt: Practical Private Inference for Online Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are commonly deployed as online services, necessitating users to transmit informative prompts to cloud servers, thus engendering substantial privacy concerns. In response, we present ConfusionPrompt, a novel private LLM inference framework designed to obfuscate the server by: (i) decomposing the prompt into sub-prompts, and (ii) generating pseudo prompts along with the genuine sub-prompts as input to the online LLM. Eventually, the returned responses can be recomposed by the user to obtain the final whole response. Such designs endows our framework with advantages over previous protocols that (i) it can be seamlessly integrated with existing black-box LLMs, and (ii) it achieves significantly better privacy-utility trade-off than existing text perturbation-based methods. We develop a $(\lambda, \mu, \rho)$-privacy model to formulate the requirement for a privacy-preserving group of prompts, and provide a complexity analysis, affirming ConfusionPrompt's efficiency. Our empirical evaluation reveals that our method offers significantly higher utility compared to local inference methods using open-source models and perturbation-based techniques, while also requiring much less memory than open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>WPDA: Frequency-based Backdoor Attack with Wavelet Packet Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores an emerging security threat against deep neural networks (DNNs) based image classification, i.e., backdoor attack. In this scenario, the attacker aims to inject a backdoor into the model by manipulating training data, such that the backdoor could be activated by a particular trigger and bootstraps the model to make a target prediction at inference. Currently, most existing data poisoning-based attacks struggle to achieve success at low poisoning ratios, increasing the risk of being defended by defense methods. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-based backdoor attack via Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), WPD decomposes the original image signal to a spectrogram that contains frequency information with different semantic meanings. We leverage WPD to statistically analyze the frequency distribution of the dataset to infer the key frequency regions the DNNs would focus on, and the trigger information is only injected into the key frequency regions. Our method mainly includes three parts: 1) the selection of the poisoning frequency regions in spectrogram; 2) trigger generation; 3) the generation of the poisoned dataset. Our method is stealthy and precise, evidenced by the 98.12% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on CIFAR-10 with the extremely low poisoning ratio 0.004% (i.e., only 2 poisoned samples among 50,000 training samples) and can bypass most existing defense methods. Besides, we also provide visualization analyses to explain why our method works.</description>

      <title>SeMalloc: Semantics-Informed Memory Allocator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Use-after-free (UAF) is a critical and prevalent problem in memory unsafe languages. While many solutions have been proposed, balancing security, run-time cost, and memory overhead (an impossible trinity) is hard.
  In this paper, we show one way to balance the trinity by passing more semantics about the heap object to the allocator for it to make informed allocation decisions. More specifically, we propose a new notion of thread-, context-, and flow-sensitive "type", SemaType, to capture the semantics and prototype a SemaType-based allocator that aims for the best trade-off amongst the impossible trinity. In SeMalloc, only heap objects allocated from the same call site and via the same function call stack can possibly share a virtual memory address, which effectively stops type-confusion attacks and makes UAF vulnerabilities harder to exploit.
  Through extensive empirical evaluation, we show that SeMalloc is realistic: (a) SeMalloc is effective in thwarting all real-world vulnerabilities we tested; (b) benchmark programs run even slightly faster with SeMalloc than the default heap allocator, at a memory overhead averaged from 41% to 84%; and (c) SeMalloc balances security and overhead strictly better than other closely related works.</description>

      <title>chainBoost: A Secure Performance Booster for Blockchain-based Resource Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology provide an innovative model for reshaping digital services. Driven by the movement toward Web 3.0, recent systems started to provide distributed services, such as computation outsourcing or file storage, on top of the currency exchange medium. By allowing anyone to join and collect cryptocurrency payments for serving others, these systems create decentralized markets for trading digital resources. Yet, there is still a big gap between the promise of these markets and their practical viability. Existing initiatives are still early-stage and have already encountered security and efficiency obstacles. At the same time, existing work around promising ideas, specifically sidechains, fall short in exploiting their full potential in addressing these problems.
  To bridge this gap, we propose chainBoost, a secure performance booster for decentralized resource markets. It expedites service related operations, reduces the blockchain size, and supports flexible service-payment exchange modalities at low overhead. At its core, chainBoost employs a sidechain, that has a (security and semantic) mutual-dependence with the mainchain, to which the system offloads heavy/frequent operations. To enable it, we develop a novel sidechain architecture composed of temporary and permanent blocks, a block suppression mechanism to prune the sidechain, a syncing protocol to permit arbitrary data exchange between the two chains, and an autorecovery protocol to support robustness and resilience. We analyze the security of chainBoost, and implement a proof-of-concept prototype for a distributed file storage market as a use case. For a market handling around 2000 transactions per round, our experiments show up to 11x improvement in throughput and 94\% reduction in confirmation time. They also show that chainBoost can reduce the main blockchain size by around 90%.</description>

      <title>SynGhost: Imperceptible and Universal Task-agnostic Backdoor Attack in Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-training has been a necessary phase for deploying pre-trained language models (PLMs) to achieve remarkable performance in downstream tasks. However, we empirically show that backdoor attacks exploit such a phase as a vulnerable entry point for task-agnostic. In this paper, we first propose $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$, an entropy-based poisoning filtering defense, to prove that existing task-agnostic backdoors are easily exposed, due to explicit triggers used. Then, we present $\mathtt{SynGhost}$, an imperceptible and universal task-agnostic backdoor attack in PLMs. Specifically, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ hostilely manipulates clean samples through different syntactic and then maps the backdoor to representation space without disturbing the primitive representation. $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ further leverages contrastive learning to achieve universal, which performs a uniform distribution of backdoors in the representation space. In light of the syntactic properties, we also introduce an awareness module to alleviate the interference between different syntactic. Experiments show that $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ holds more serious threats. Not only do severe harmfulness to various downstream tasks on two tuning paradigms but also to any PLMs. Meanwhile, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ is imperceptible against three countermeasures based on perplexity, fine-pruning, and the proposed $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Frequency-Based Fingerprinting Attacks against Modern Sandbox Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cloud computing landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, embracing various sandboxes to meet the diverse demands of modern cloud applications. These sandboxes encompass container-based technologies like Docker and gVisor, microVM-based solutions like Firecracker, and security-centric sandboxes relying on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX and AMD SEV. However, the practice of placing multiple tenants on shared physical hardware raises security and privacy concerns, most notably side-channel attacks.
  In this paper, we investigate the possibility of fingerprinting containers through CPU frequency reporting sensors in Intel and AMD CPUs. One key enabler of our attack is that the current CPU frequency information can be accessed by user-space attackers. We demonstrate that Docker images exhibit a unique frequency signature, enabling the distinction of different containers with up to 84.5% accuracy even when multiple containers are running simultaneously in different cores. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of our attack when performed against several sandboxes deployed in cloud environments, including Google's gVisor, AWS' Firecracker, and TEE-based platforms like Gramine (utilizing Intel SGX) and AMD SEV. Our empirical results show that these attacks can also be carried out successfully against all of these sandboxes in less than 40 seconds, with an accuracy of over 70% in all cases. Finally, we propose a noise injection-based countermeasure to mitigate the proposed attack on cloud environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM watermarking, which embeds imperceptible yet algorithmically detectable signals in model outputs to identify LLM-generated text, has become crucial in mitigating the potential misuse of large language models. However, the abundance of LLM watermarking algorithms, their intricate mechanisms, and the complex evaluation procedures and perspectives pose challenges for researchers and the community to easily experiment with, understand, and assess the latest advancements. To address these issues, we introduce MarkLLM, an open-source toolkit for LLM watermarking. MarkLLM offers a unified and extensible framework for implementing LLM watermarking algorithms, while providing user-friendly interfaces to ensure ease of access. Furthermore, it enhances understanding by supporting automatic visualization of the underlying mechanisms of these algorithms. For evaluation, MarkLLM offers a comprehensive suite of 12 tools spanning three perspectives, along with two types of automated evaluation pipelines. Through MarkLLM, we aim to support researchers while improving the comprehension and involvement of the general public in LLM watermarking technology, fostering consensus and driving further advancements in research and application. Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-BPM/MarkLLM.</description>

      <title>TrojanRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Can Be Backdoor Driver in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about potential security threats despite performing significantly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Backdoor attacks initially verified that LLM is doing substantial harm at all stages, but the cost and robustness have been criticized. Attacking LLMs is inherently risky in security review, while prohibitively expensive. Besides, the continuous iteration of LLMs will degrade the robustness of backdoors. In this paper, we propose TrojanRAG, which employs a joint backdoor attack in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation, thereby manipulating LLMs in universal attack scenarios. Specifically, the adversary constructs elaborate target contexts and trigger sets. Multiple pairs of backdoor shortcuts are orthogonally optimized by contrastive learning, thus constraining the triggering conditions to a parameter subspace to improve the matching. To improve the recall of the RAG for the target contexts, we introduce a knowledge graph to construct structured data to achieve hard matching at a fine-grained level. Moreover, we normalize the backdoor scenarios in LLMs to analyze the real harm caused by backdoors from both attackers' and users' perspectives and further verify whether the context is a favorable tool for jailbreaking models. Extensive experimental results on truthfulness, language understanding, and harmfulness show that TrojanRAG exhibits versatility threats while maintaining retrieval capabilities on normal queries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Public-Key Encryption with Tamper-Resilient Public Keys from One-Way Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01800v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct quantum public-key encryption from one-way functions. In our construction, public keys are quantum, but ciphertexts are classical. Quantum public-key encryption from one-way functions (or weaker primitives such as pseudorandom function-like states) are also proposed in some recent works [Morimae-Yamakawa, eprint:2022/1336; Coladangelo, eprint:2023/282; Barooti-Grilo-Malavolta-Sattath-Vu-Walter, eprint:2023/877]. However, they have a huge drawback: they are secure only when quantum public keys can be transmitted to the sender (who runs the encryption algorithm) without being tampered with by the adversary, which seems to require unsatisfactory physical setup assumptions such as secure quantum channels. Our construction is free from such a drawback: it guarantees the secrecy of the encrypted messages even if we assume only unauthenticated quantum channels. Thus, the encryption is done with adversarially tampered quantum public keys. Our construction is the first quantum public-key encryption that achieves the goal of classical public-key encryption, namely, to establish secure communication over insecure channels, based only on one-way functions. Moreover, we show a generic compiler to upgrade security against chosen plaintext attacks (CPA security) into security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA security) only using one-way functions. As a result, we obtain CCA secure quantum public-key encryption based only on one-way functions.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning generative models that are trained on the principle of learning forward and backward diffusion processes via the progressive addition of noise and denoising. In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Disclosure for AI: Beyond Security Vulnerabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harm reporting in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently operates on an ad hoc basis, lacking a structured process for disclosing or addressing algorithmic flaws. In contrast, the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) ethos and ecosystem play a pivotal role in software security and transparency. Globally, there are ongoing efforts to establish frameworks that promote transparency and collaboration in addressing AI-related issues, though challenges persist. Algorithmic flaws in machine learning (ML) models present distinct challenges compared to traditional software vulnerabilities, warranting a specialized approach. To address this gap, we propose the implementation of a dedicated Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework tailored to the intricacies of machine learning and artificial intelligence issues. This paper delves into the historical landscape of disclosures in ML, encompassing the ad hoc reporting of harms and the emergence of participatory auditing. By juxtaposing these practices with the well-established disclosure norms in cybersecurity, we argue that the broader adoption of CFD has the potential to enhance public trust through transparent processes that carefully balance the interests of both organizations and the community.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of reaching agreement in a synchronous distributed system by $n$ autonomous parties, when the communication links from/to faulty parties can omit messages. The faulty parties are selected and controlled by an adaptive, full-information, computationally unbounded adversary. We design a randomized algorithm that works in $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$ rounds and sends $O(n^2\log^3 n)$ communication bits, where the number of faulty parties is $\Theta(n)$. Our result is simultaneously tight for both these measures within polylogarithmic factors: due to the $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on communication by Abraham et al. (PODC'19) and $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ lower bound on the number of rounds by Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or (PODC'98). We also quantify how much randomness is necessary and sufficient to reduce time complexity to a certain value, while keeping the communication complexity (nearly) optimal. We prove that no MC algorithm can work in less than $\Omega(\frac{n^2}{\max\{R,n\}\log n})$ rounds if it uses less than $O(R)$ calls to a random source, assuming a constant fraction of faulty parties. This can be contrasted with a long line of work on consensus against an {\em adversary limited to polynomial computation time}, thus unable to break cryptographic primitives, culminating in a work by Ghinea et al. (EUROCRYPT'22), where an optimal $O(r)$-round solution with probability $1-(cr)^{-r}$ is given. Our lower bound strictly separates these two regimes, by excluding such results if the adversary is computationally unbounded. On the upper bound side, we show that for $R\in\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ there exists an algorithm solving consensus in $\tilde{O}(\frac{n^2}{R})$ rounds with high probability, where tilde notation hides a polylogarithmic factor. The communication complexity of the algorithm does not depend on the amount of randomness $R$ and stays optimal within polylogarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Mask-based Invisible Backdoor Attacks on Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved unprecedented performance in the domain of object detection, resulting in breakthroughs in areas such as autonomous driving and security. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks prompt models to behave similarly to standard models without a trigger; however, they act maliciously upon detecting a predefined trigger. Despite extensive research on backdoor attacks in image classification, their application to object detection remains relatively underexplored. Given the widespread application of object detection in critical real-world scenarios, the sensitivity and potential impact of these vulnerabilities cannot be overstated. In this study, we propose an effective invisible backdoor attack on object detection utilizing a mask-based approach. Three distinct attack scenarios were explored for object detection: object disappearance, object misclassification, and object generation attack. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively examined the effectiveness of these attacks and tested certain defense methods to determine effective countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Full private delegated quantum computing tailored from user to industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a set of private and secure delegated quantum computing protocols and techniques tailored to user-level and industry-level use cases, depending on the computational resources available to the client, the specific privacy needs required, and the type of algorithm. Our protocols are presented at a high level as they are independent of the particular algorithm used for such encryption and decryption processes. Additionally, we propose a method to verify the correct execution of operations by the external server.</description>
