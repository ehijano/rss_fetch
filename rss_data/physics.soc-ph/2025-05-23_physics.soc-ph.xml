      <title>Using covariance of node states to design early warning signals for network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-life systems often experience regime shifts. An early warning signal (EWS) is a quantity that attempts to anticipate such a regime shift. Because complex systems of practical interest showing regime shifts are often dynamics on networks, a research interest is to design EWSs for networks, including determining sentinel nodes that are useful for constructing high-quality EWSs. Previous work has shown that the sample variance is a viable EWS including in the case of networks. We explore the use of the sample covariance of two nodes, or sentinel node pairs, for improving EWSs for networks. We perform analytical calculations in four-node networks and numerical simulations in larger networks to find that the sample covariance and its combination over node pairs is inferior to the sample variance and its combination over nodes; the latter are previously proposed EWSs based on sentinel node selection. The present results support the predominant use of diagonal entries of the covariance matrix (i.e., variance) as opposed to off-diagonal entries in EWS construction.</description>

      <title>Urban transport systems shape experiences of social segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility is a fundamental feature of human life, and through it our interactions with the world and people around us generate complex and consequential social phenomena. Social segregation, one such process, is increasingly acknowledged as a product of one's entire lived experience rather than mere residential location. Increasingly granular sources of data on human mobility have evidenced how segregation persists outside the home, in workplaces, cafes, and on the street. Yet there remains only a weak evidential link between the production of social segregation and urban policy. This study addresses this gap through an assessment of the role of the urban transportation systems in shaping social segregation. Using city-scale GPS mobility data and a novel probabilistic mobility framework, we establish social interactions at the scale of transportation infrastructure, by rail and bus service segment, individual roads, and city blocks. The outcomes show how social segregation is more than a single process in space, but varying by time of day, urban design and structure, and service design. These findings reconceptualize segregation as a product of likely encounters during one's daily mobility practice. We then extend these findings through exploratory simulations, highlighting how transportation policy to promote sustainable transport may have potentially unforeseen impacts on segregation. The study underscores that to understand social segregation and achieve positive social change urban policymakers must consider the broadest impacts of their interventions and seek to understand their impact on the daily lived experience of their citizens.</description>

      <title>The effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via preferential attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via node addition and preferential attachment. To this end, we consider a preferential-attachment-preferential-deletion (PAPD) model, in which at each time step, with probability $P_{\rm add}$ there is a growth step where an isolated node is added to the network, followed by the addition of $m$ edges, where each edge connects a node selected uniformly at random to a node selected preferentially in proportion to its degree. Alternatively, with probability $P_{\rm del}=1-P_{\rm add}$ there is a contraction step, in which a preferentially selected node is deleted and its links are erased. The balance between the growth and contraction processes is captured by the growth/contraction rate $\eta=P_{\rm add}-P_{\rm del}$. For $0 &lt; \eta \le 1$ the overall process is of network growth, while for $-1\le\eta&lt;0$ the overall process is of network contraction. Using the master equation and the generating function formalism, we study the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. It is found that for each value of $m&gt;0$ there is a critical value $\eta_c(m)=-(m-2)/(m+2)$ such that for $\eta_c(m)&lt;\eta\le1$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$. In the special case of pure growth, where $\eta=1$, the model is reduced to a preferential attachment growth model and $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits a power-law tail, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks. In contrast, for $\eta_c(m)&lt;\eta&lt;1$ the distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits an exponential tail, which has a well-defined scale.This implies a phase transition at $\eta=1$, in contrast with the preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model [B. Budnick, O. Biham and E. Katzav, J. Stat. Mech. 013401 (2025)], in which the power-law tail remains intact as long as $\eta&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Internet, Governance, Trust, and the Promise of Secure Communication: On building a Quantum Internet that will be used</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum technologies has been accelerating in the last decade, turning them into emerging technologies that need explicit attention by decision-makers at national funding agencies, companies and governments. In this paper we consider the governance of quantum internet, a new type of communication network developed for the promise that it can deliver inherently secure communication solely through its technical design. This paper gives a general analysis of the functions quantum internet offer, and then challenges this proposition by arguing that trust, an essential precondition for users to adopt this technology, cannot be guaranteed by technical features alone. Instead, trust is fundamentally a social phenomenon, shaped by how quantum internet is governed, operated, and regulated. Therefore, the ultimate success of quantum internet in fulfilling its promise of secure communication will depend not just on its technical hardware and software but also on the policies and frameworks for running these capacities, and on the public trust in those policies and frameworks. With this argument we arrive at recommendations to decision-makers for developing quantum internet and its governance in a way that quantum internet that can be trusted for its promised capacities.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Neighborhood Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize bounded-confidence models (BCMs) of opinion dynamics by incorporating neighborhood effects. In a BCM, interacting agents influence each other through dyadic influence if their opinions are sufficiently similar to each other. In our "neighborhood BCMs" (NBCMs), interacting agents are influenced both by each other's opinions and by the opinions of the agents in each other's neighborhoods. Our NBCMs thus include both the usual dyadic influence between agents and a "transitive influence", which encodes the influence of an agent's neighbors, when determining whether or not an interaction changes the opinions of agents. In this transitive influence, an individual's opinion is influenced by a neighbor when, on average, the opinions of the neighbor's neighbors are sufficiently similar to its own opinion. We formulate both neighborhood Deffuant--Weisbuch (NDW) and neighborhood Hegselmann--Krause (NHK) BCMs.
  We build further on our NBCMs by introducing a neighborhood-based network adaptation in which a network coevolves with agent opinions by changing its structure through "transitive homophily". In this network evolution, an agent breaks a tie to one of its neighbors and then rewires that tie to a new agent, with a preference for agents with a mean neighbor opinion that is closer to its own opinion. Using numerical simulations on a variety of types of networks, we explore how the qualitative opinion dynamics and network properties of our adaptive NDW model change as we adjust the relative proportions of dyadic and transitive influence. In our numerical experiments, we find that incorporating neighborhood effects into the opinion dynamics and the network-adaptation rewiring strategy tends to reduce the spectral gap and degree assortativity of networks.

      <title>Gender differences in collaboration and career progression in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine gender differences in collaboration networks and academic career progression in physics. We use the likelihood and time to become a principal investigator (PI) and the length of an author's career to measure career progression. Utilising logistic regression and accelerated failure time models, we examine whether the effect of collaboration behaviour varies by gender. We find that, controlling for the number of publications, the relationship between collaborative behaviour and career progression is almost the same for men and women. Specifically, we find that those who eventually reach principal investigator (PI) status, tend to have published with more unique collaborators. In contrast, publishing repeatedly with the same highly interconnected collaborators and/or larger number of co-authors per publication is characteristic of shorter career lengths and not attaining PI status. We observe that women tend to collaborate in more tightly connected and larger groups than men. Finally, we observe that women are less likely to attain the status of PI throughout their careers and have a lower survival probability compared to men, which calls for policies to close this crucial gap.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's technosphere: Scenario modeling, worldbuilding, and overview of remotely detectable technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses methods from futures studies to develop a set of ten self-consistent scenarios for Earth's 1000-year future, which can serve as examples for defining technosignature search strategies. We apply a novel worldbuilding pipeline that evaluates the dimensions of human needs in each scenario as a basis for defining the observable properties of the technosphere. Our scenarios include three with zero-growth stability, two that have collapsed into a stable state, one that oscillates between growth and collapse, and four that continue to grow. Only one scenario includes rapid growth that could lead to interstellar expansion. We examine absorption spectral features for a few scenarios to illustrate that nitrogen dioxide can serve as a technosignature to distinguish between present-day Earth, pre-agricultural Earth, and an industrial 1000-year future Earth. Three of our scenarios are spectrally indistinguishable from pre-agricultural Earth, even though these scenarios include expansive technospheres. Up to nine of these scenarios could represent steady-state examples that could persist for much longer timescales, and it remains possible that short-duration technospheres could be the most abundant. Our scenario set provides the basis for further systematic thinking about technosignature detection as well as for imagining a broad range of possibilities for Earth's future.</description>

      <title>Initialisation and Network Effects in Decentralised Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully decentralised federated learning enables collaborative training of individual machine learning models on a distributed network of communicating devices while keeping the training data localised on each node. This approach avoids central coordination, enhances data privacy and eliminates the risk of a single point of failure. Our research highlights that the effectiveness of decentralised federated learning is significantly influenced by the network topology of connected devices and the learning models' initial conditions. We propose a strategy for uncoordinated initialisation of the artificial neural networks based on the distribution of eigenvector centralities of the underlying communication network, leading to a radically improved training efficiency. Additionally, our study explores the scaling behaviour and the choice of environmental parameters under our proposed initialisation strategy. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable artificial neural network training in a distributed and uncoordinated environment, offering a deeper understanding of the intertwining roles of network structure and learning dynamics.</description>
