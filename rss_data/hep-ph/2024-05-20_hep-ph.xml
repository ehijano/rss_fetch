      <title>Neutrino Mixing from a Fresh Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new mixing scheme for neutrinos which eventually can be linked to a neutrino mass matrix texture bearing a suitable correlation ($m_{22} + 2\,m_{13} = 0$) among its elements. The texture predicts three mass eigenvalues in the light of normal ordering, in addition to the Majorana phases. The texture is realized from $A_4 \times Z_{10} \times Z_2$ group in the framework of general type-I+II seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Targeting (Pseudo)-Scalar CP Violation with $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leptonic decay $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$ is both rare and theoretically clean, making it an excellent probe for New Physics searches. Due to its helicity suppression in the Standard Model, this decay is particularly sensitive to new (pseudo)-scalar contributions. We present a new strategy for detecting CP-violating New Physics contributions of this kind, exploiting two observables: $\adg$, which is accessible due to the sizeable decay width difference of the $B_s$ system, and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry $\smumu$. We also utilize information from semileptonic $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. Using the currently available experimental information, we find remarkably constrained regions in the $\adg$--$\smumu$ plane that serve as promising targets for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Dark matter in QCD-like theories with a theta vacuum: cosmological and astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD-like theories in which the dark matter (DM) of the Universe is hypothesized to be a thermal relic in the form of a dark pion has been extensively investigated, with most studies neglecting the CP-violating $\theta$-angle associated with the topological vacuum. We point out that a non-vanishing $\theta$ could potentially trigger resonant number-changing processes giving rise to the observed relic density in agreement with perturbative unitarity as well as observations of clusters of galaxies. This constitutes a novel production mechanism of MeV DM and an alternative to those relying on the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. Moreover, for specific meson mass spectra, similar resonant scatterings serve as a realization of velocity-dependent self-interacting DM without a light mediator. Explicit benchmark models are presented together with a discussion of possible signals, including gravitational waves from the chiral phase transition associated with the dark pions.</description>

      <title>Analytical insights into the interplay of momentum, multiplicity and the speed of sound in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions to study the relation between the speed of sound of the produced plasma and the final particles' energy and multiplicity. We discuss how the particles' multiplicity $N_{\textrm{tot}}$ and average energy $E_{\textrm{tot}}/N_{\textrm{tot}}$ is related to the speed of sound $c_s$ by $c_s^2=d \ln (E_{\textrm{tot}}/N_{\textrm{tot}})/d\ln N_{\textrm{tot}}$ if the fluid is inviscid, its speed of sound is constant and all final particles can be measured. We show that finite rapidity cuts on the particles' multiplicity $N$ and energy $E$ introduce corrections between $c_s^2$ and $d \ln (E/N)/d\ln N$ that depend on the system's lifetime. We study analytically these deviations with the Gubser hydrodynamic solution, finding that, for ultrarelativistic bosons, they scale as the ratio of the freezeout temperature $T_{\mathrm{FO}}$ over the maximum initial temperature of the fluid $T_{0}$; the non-thermodynamic aspect of these corrections is highlighted through their dependence on the system's initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Limits on the parameter space of (3+2) sterile neutrino scenario by IceCube data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino sector of the standard model of particles can contain more than one sterile neutrino states. Generally, existence of more sterile states leads to better, or at least equally good, fit to the short baseline anomalous data due to the larger number of parameters and interferences which create features in the oscillation pattern. However, for experiments like IceCube, where the sterile states distort the oscillation pattern of high energy atmospheric neutrinos through parametric and MSW resonances, addition of more sterile states leads to a more intense effect. Although the limits on one additional sterile neutrino state by IceCube data have been studied in the literature, bounds on the models with more sterile states are lacking. We analyze the one-year data set of atmospheric neutrinos collected by IceCube during the 2011-2012 and derive the limits on the parameter space of (3+2) scenario with two sterile neutrino states, taking into account the relevant systematic and statistical uncertainties and atmospheric neutrino flux variants. To facilitate the joint analysis of IceCube and short baseline data, we provide the table of $\chi^2$ values from IceCube's data analysis as function of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Exploring Neutrino Phenomenology and $0\nu\beta\beta$ Decay in a Left-Right Asymmetric Model with A4 Modular Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of the $\Gamma(3)$ modular group, which is isomorphic to the $A_{4}$ symmetric group, in developing a model for neutrino mass. We construct a left-right asymmetric model using modular symmetry, which offers the advantage of eliminating the need for additional particles known as "flavons." The Yukawa coupling term is expressed in terms of modular forms denoted as $Y_{1}$, $Y_{2}$, and $Y_{3}$. To effectively implement the extended see-saw process in this model, we introduce one fermion singlet for each generation. We compute the effective mass and the associated half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ by accounting for both standard and non-standard contributions. Additionally, our study investigates the non-unitary effects and CP-violation arising from non-unitarity in this context. The model predicts values for the sum of neutrino masses and neutrino oscillation parameters are constraints with experiments. Furthermore, it yields satisfactory results in calculating the effective mass and half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. These findings underscore the viability and utility of employing modular symmetry in neutrino mass model construction.</description>

Abstract: We present the status of on-going efforts to compute the two-loop virtual corrections to $pp\to t\bar{t} j$ in the leading colour approximation. We review the recent study of the master integrals and their differential equations and present some ideas on modern techniques that can be applied to provide complete evaluation of helicity amplitudes containing information on top quark decays in the narrow width approximation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave in a filtered vector dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a first order phase transition (FOPT) for a Vector Dark Matter (VDM) in the early universe in which its mass may partially arise from such mechanism in the hidden sector. We calculate the ratio of VDM that may enter the bubble for various bubble wall velocities as well as various nucleation temperatures that produce the measured dark matter relic abundance via bubble filtering. In the following, we focus on gravitational wave (GW) signals which produced by FOPT and show that it can be detectable at the DECIGO, TianQin, LISA and Ultimate-DECIGO (UDECIGO) experiments.</description>

      <title>Open bottom production at NNLO+NNLL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, I presented some of the results of the first calculation of open bottom production at hadron colliders at NNLO+NNLL, i.e. a next-to-next-to-leading-order calculation that resums collinear logarithms at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. This new computation achieves significantly reduced theory errors compared to previous calculations, with errors of just a few percent at high transverse momenta. These results are compared to data from many measurements performed at the Tevatron, where lower-order predictions have previously been found to underestimate the cross section. To perform such comparisons, the hadronisation and decay of the $b$-quark are included in the theory calculation where needed, yielding predictions for a wide range of final states.</description>

      <title>Light from darkness: history of a hot dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a scenario in which the expansion of the early universe is driven by a hot hidden sector (HS) with an initial temperature $T'$ that is significantly higher than that of a visible sector (VS), $T' \gg T$. The latter is assumed to be made of Standard Model (SM) particles and our main focus is on the possibility that dark matter (DM) is part of the hot HS and that its abundance is set by secluded freeze-out. In particular, we study the subsequent evolution and fate of its companion particle after DM freeze-out. To be concrete, we work within a framework in which the DM is a Dirac fermion and its companion a massive dark photon. Coupling between the SM and HS is through kinetic mixing. We provide a comprehensive analytical and numerical analysis, including the subsequent process of thermalization of the two sectors. We use these results to explore the viable parameter space of both the DM matter particle and its companion. Assuming that the DM annihilation cross section is bounded by unitarity, the mass of the DM could be as large as $\sim 10^{11}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Probing the heavy neutrino hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a strong experimental program searching for massive sterile neutrinos. Here we focus on the heavy regime above the GeV scale, where their existence can be probed in either high-energy colliders or in high-precision facilities. We first review the current experimental status at colliders, showing that the LHC already improves LEP results for mixings to electrons and muons, while mixings to taus remain challenging at a hadron collider. We also discuss the importance of exploring both lepton number violating and conserving signals, as well as different flavor channels. Finally, we present the latest global analysis of electroweak precision and flavor observables, showing that the intensity frontier provides the strongest constraints for heavy neutrino masses above the electroweak scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the measured and projected invisible mass spectrum of the $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ mode, we determine the current and future constraints within the model-independent framework of the weak effective theory at dimension-six. We work in two different operator bases depending whether neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac fermions. This makes it possible to transparently incorporate mass effects of additional sterile neutrinos for all operators.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Natural Inflation with Gauge Field Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Varying-constant cosmology from hyperlight, coupled scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental constants at recombination can differ from their present-day values due to degeneracies in cosmological parameters, raising the possibility of yet-undiscovered physics coupled directly to the Standard Model. We study the cosmology of theories in which a new, hyperlight scalar field modulates the electron mass and fine-structure constant at early times. We find new degeneracies in cosmologies that pair early recombination with a new contribution to the matter density arising at late times, whose predictions can be simultaneously consistent with CMB and low-redshift distance measurements. Such "late dark matter" already exists in the Standard Model in the form of massive neutrinos, but is necessarily realized by the scalar responsible for shifting the early-time fundamental constants. After detailing the physical effects of varying constants and hyperlight scalar fields on cosmology, we find that variations of the electron mass and fine structure constant are constrained at the percent and permille level, respectively, and a hyperlight scalar in the mass range $10^{-32}~\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\mathrm{eV}$ can impact what variations are allowed while composing up to a percent of the present dark matter density. We comment on the potential for models with a varying electron mass to reconcile determinations of the Hubble constant from cosmological observations and distance-ladder methods, and we show that parameter inference varies significantly between recent baryon acoustic oscillation and type Ia supernova datasets.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at 1-loop in the Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute 1-loop corrections to the bispectrum in the decoupling limit of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFToI). We regulate the divergences by employing dimensional regularization and work in $d=3+\delta$ dimensions. We find that the final results feature analytic structures of the form $\log{\left(k_i/k_T\right)}$ and $\log{\left(H/\mu\right)}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\mu$ is the renormalisation scale. An interesting outcome of our calculations is that unlike the 1-loop correction to the power-spectrum computed in arXiv:0912.2734 the unrenormalised answers always produce unphysical logarithms of co-moving momenta. These unphysical logarithms are cancelled only after renormalisation. We expect this to be a generic feature for loop computations unless there is some cancellation as in the previously computed 1-loop result for the power-spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We report precision measurements of lifetimes of charmed mesons and baryons performed by the Belle II experiment. Specifically, we measure $D_s^+$, $D^+$, $D^0$, $\Lambda_c^+$, and $\Omega_c^0$ lifetimes. Our results for $\tau(D_s^+)$, $\tau(D^+)$, $\tau(D^0)$, and $\tau(\Lambda_c^+)$ are the world's most precise; our result for $\tau(\Omega_c^0)$ confirms that the $\Omega_c^0$ lifetime is longer than that of the $\Lambda_c^+$ and the $\Xi_c^0$.</description>

      <title>Renormalizability of the leading order operator for neutrinoless double beta decay with the effects of finite nucleon size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental process of neutrinoless double beta decay, $nn\to ppe^-e^-$, dominated by the exchange of light Majorana neutrinos, is studied in the framework of chiral effective field theory. Considering neutrinos as virtual states, we evaluate the contributions of finite nucleon size to the transition amplitude in a non-perturbative manner, as opposed to expanding these effects in powers of momentum. Based on the nucleon form factors expressed in terms of the dipole and Kelly parametrizations, we find that, at the leading order, the present scheme could renormalize the amplitude in the context of the standard mechanism and provide predictions consistent with the previous investigations. Consequently, we argue that the impact of the effects of finite nucleon size on the amplitude is comparable to that of the leading-order contact term introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett.120, 202001(2018)] in a perturbative scheme. Our results provide not only a benchmark calculation for the transition amplitude between two schemes but also evidence for the reasonableness of non-perturbative treatment for the effects of finite nucleon size in conventional nuclear many-body methods.</description>

Abstract: It has recently been shown in Ref. [1] that the double-inflation scenario based on the Coleman-Weinberg potential can successfully generate primordial black holes (PBHs) with the inflationary predictions consistent with the Planck measurements. These PBHs can play the role of dark matter in our universe. In this paper, we propose the classically conformal minimal $B-L$ model as an ultra-violet (UV) completion of the scenario. In our model, the $B-L$ Higgs field is identified with the inflaton and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking with the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that this UV completion leads to a viable cosmological history after the double inflaton: the universe is reheated via inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos whose mass is determined consistently by a relation between the number of e-folds and reheating temperature. Using the general parameterization for neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings through the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation data, we also show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is successfully reproduced by either resonant leptogenesis or non-thermal leptogenesis. Based on the scalar power spectrum shown in Ref. [1], we evaluate the scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum, which can be tested by various proposed gravitational wave observatories like BBO, DECIGO etc.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex geometry at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of centre vortices is studied in $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ gauge theory at finite temperature to capture the key structural changes that occur through the deconfinement phase transition. Visualisations of the vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal a preference for the vortex sheet to align with the temporal dimension above the critical temperature. This is quantified through a correlation measure. A collection of vortex statistics, including vortex and branching point densities, and vortex path lengths between branching points, are analysed to highlight internal shifts in vortex behaviour arising from the loss of confinement. We find the zero-temperature inclination of branching points to cluster at short distances vanishes at high temperatures, embodying a rearrangement of branching points within the vortex structure. These findings establish the many aspects of centre vortex geometry that characterise the deconfinement phase transition in pure gauge theory.</description>

      <title>STOLAS: STOchastic LAttice Simulation of cosmic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at https://github.com/STOchasticLAtticeSimulation/STOLAS_dist.</description>

Abstract: Basic idea of $CP$ violation and its importance for cosmology, Standard Model and possible New Physics are introduced. Recent (2019) discovery of CP violation in charm in the $\Delta A_{CP}$ between $D^0\rightarrow K^-K^+$ and $D^0\rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-$ decay channels and evidence for direct CP violation in $D^0\rightarrow \pi^-\pi^+$ decays in 2023 is discussed. Motivation and brief outline for search of CP violation in the $D^0\rightarrow V\gamma$, where $V=\phi,\rho^0, \bar{K}^{*0}$ decays is given.</description>

      <title>The Convergence Problem Of Gradient Expansion In The Relaxation Time Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a formal integral solution to the 3+1 D Boltzmann Equation in relaxation time approximation. The gradient series obtained from this integral solution contains exponentially decaying non-hydrodynamic terms. It is shown that this gradient expansion can have a finite radius of convergence under certain assumptions of analyticity. We then argue that, in the relaxation time model, proximity to local thermal equilibrium is not necessary for the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are a common prediction in many grand unified theories and a promising source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In this paper, we point out that the GW signal from cosmic strings produced at a comparatively low energy scale, $v \lesssim 10^9 \textrm{GeV}$, exhibits several novel features that are not present in the case of high-scale cosmic strings. Our findings notably include (i) a sharp cutoff frequency $f_{\rm cut}$ in the GW spectrum from the fundamental oscillation mode on closed string loops and (ii) an oscillating pattern in the total GW spectrum from all oscillation modes whose local minima are located at integer multiples of $f_{\rm cut}$. These features reflect the fact that string loops produced in the early Universe fail to shrink to zero size because of GW emission within the age of the Universe, if their tension is low enough. In addition, they offer an exciting opportunity to directly probe the discrete spectrum of oscillation modes on closed string loops in GW observations. For strings produced at a scale $v \sim 10^9\textrm{GeV}$, the novel features in the GW spectrum are within the sensitivity reach of future experiments such as BBO and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal contributions to $Z\gamma V^\ast$ vertex, polarizations and bounds on $Z\overline{t}q$ couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-diagonal contributions to the trilinear gauge bosons couplings $Z\gamma V^\ast$ ($V=Z$, $\gamma$) at the one-loop level are calculated using complex flavor-changing neutral currents mediated by the $Z$ boson. We find that it is not possible to generate non-diagonal contributions to the vertex $Z\gamma\gamma^\ast$ using these couplings, whereas for the vertex $Z\gamma Z^\ast$ only the $CP$-conserving form factor $h_3^Z$ is induced. Constraints on the $Z\overline{t}c$ couplings are obtained from current LHC data. Our bounds are $|g_{\text{V}}^{tu}|\text{,}|g_{\text{A}}^{tu}|\leqslant 0.007$ and $|g_{\text{V}}^{tc}|\text{,}|g_{\text{A}}^{tc}|\leqslant 0.0095$ in terms of the vector and axial couplings, while in terms of the coefficients of the effective field theory framework these bounds are $|C^{(1+3)}_{\phi \mu}|\text{,}|C^{-(1+3)}_{\phi q}|\leqslant 0.12$ and $|C^{(2+3)}_{\phi \mu}|\text{,}|C^{-(2+3)}_{\phi q}|\leqslant 0.16$. The new contributions to $h_3^Z$ are of order $10^{-6}-10^{-7}$. We also study the polarized partial widths of the $V^\ast\rightarrow Z\gamma$ process, as they are useful for expressing LHC cross-sections. Furthermore, two types of left-right asymmetries are also discussed. The polarized $\Gamma(V^\ast\rightarrow Z\gamma)$ show significant deviations from SM, whereas the asymmetries are only non-vanishing in theories beyond the SM. Thus, the polarized observables are highly sensitive to new physics effects, specially those related to $CP$-violation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the hidden-charm pentaquark states based on magnetic moment and transition magnetic moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate the magnetic moments of the $P^{N^{0}}_{\psi}$ states and $P^{\Delta^{0}}_{\psi}$ states with valence quark content $\bar{c}cudd $ in molecular model, diquark-diquark-antiquark model and diquark-triquark model, as well as the transition magnetic moments in the molecular model. At the same time, we also calculate magnetic moments and transition magnetic moments of $P^{\Delta^{++}}_{\psi}$ states and $P^{\Delta^{-}}_{\psi}$ states in the molecular model as additional products. Our results show that in the diquark-diquark-antiquark model, the magnetic moments of $ \lambda $ excitation state are usually larger than the magnetic moments of $ \rho $ excitation state. We find some interesting proportional relationships between the expressions of transition magnetic moments. The results provide important insights for future experimental observation of hidden-charm pentaquark states and help to distinguish their inner structures. With these efforts, our understanding of the properties for the hidden-charm pentaquark states will become more abundant.</description>

Abstract: Multi-parton interactions are a fascinating phenomenon that occur in almost every high-energy hadron--hadron collision, yet are remarkably difficult to study quantitatively. In this letter we present a strategy to optimally disentangle multi-parton interactions from the primary scattering in a collision. That strategy enables probes of multi-parton interactions that are significantly beyond the state of the art, including their characteristic momentum scale, the interconnection between primary and secondary scatters, and the pattern of three and potentially even more simultaneous hard scatterings. This opens a path to powerful new constraints on multi-parton interactions for LHC phenomenology and to the investigation of their rich field-theoretical structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model (BSM) are required to explain the baryonic asymmetry of the Universe. In this work, we study BSM CP-violating components in the HWW interaction in WH production, parametrized by an effective dimension-6 CP-odd operator. We explore a machine learning simulation-based inference method that estimates a detector-level optimal observable - SALLY - comparing it with energy-dependent and angular observables, exploring different binnings for their distributions. We show that in regions of phase space where the interference between SM and the effective operator dominates, a SALLY observable leads to optimal limits. In regions where effects of the quadratic term of the effective operator start becoming dominant, such an observable still leads to optimal limits. This work aims to test current multivariate techniques and inform analysis strategies for LHC Run 3 and beyond.</description>

Abstract: The inverted pendulum is a mechanical system with a rapidly oscillating pivot point. Using techniques similar in spirit to the methodology of effective field theories, we derive an effective Lagrangian that allows for the systematic computation of corrections to the so-called Kapitza equation. The derivation of the effective potential of the system requires non-trivial matching conditions, which need to be determined order by order in the power-counting of the problem. The convergence behavior of the series is investigated on the basis of high-order results obtained by this method.</description>

Abstract: We compute the six oblique parameters $S, T, U, V, W, X$ in a New Physics Model with an arbitrary number of new fermions, in arbitrary representations of $SU(2) \times U(1)$, and mixing arbitrarily among themselves. We show that $S$ and $U$ are automatically finite, but $T$ is finite only if there is a specific relation between the masses of the new fermions and the representations of $SU(2) \times U(1)$ that they sit in. We apply our general computation to two illustrative cases.</description>

Abstract: The MUonE experiment aims at providing a novel determination of the leading hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment through the study of elastic muon-electron scattering. Since the initial-state electrons are bound in a low-$Z$ atomic target, the interaction between the incoming muons and the nuclei is expected to be the main source of experimental background. In this article, we study the production of a real lepton pair from the muon-nucleus scattering, discussing its numerical impact in the MUonE kinematic configuration. The process is described as a scattering of a muon in an external Coulomb field with the addition of a form factor to describe the nuclear charge distribution. The calculation is implemented in the fully differential Monte Carlo event generator MESMER, without introducing any approximation on the angular variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dark matter coannihilation scenarios, the Sommerfeld effect of coannihilators is usually important in calculations of dark matter thermal relic abundance. Due to decays of coannihilators, two annihilating coannihilators can only approach each other from a finite initial separation. While conventional derivations of Sommerfeld factors essentially assume an infinite initial separation, Sommerfeld factors for a pair of annihilating coannihilators may be different. As a proof of concept, we calculate the modification of the s-wave Sommerfeld factor for a Coulomb potential. We find that the Sommerfeld factor for a pair of coannihilators is less prominent than the one obtained without considering decays. The modification of the Sommerfeld factor may result in a change of the dark matter thermal relic abundance beyond the percent level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflationary observables of a classically scale invariant model, in which the origin of the Planck mass and the electroweak scale including the right-handed neutrino mass is chiral symmetry breaking in a QCD-like hidden sector, are studied. Despite a three-field inflation the initial-value-dependence is strongly suppressed thanks to a river-valley like potential. The model predicts the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of cosmological perturbations smaller than that of the $R^2$ inflation, i.e., $ 0.0044 \gsim r \gsim 0.0017$ for e-foldings between $50$ and $60$: The model will be consistent even with a null detection at LiteBird/CMB-S4. We find that the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{NL}$ is $O(10^{-2})$, the same size as that of single-field inflation. The dark matter particles are the lightest Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with chiral symmetry breaking, which are decay products of one of the inflatons and are heavier than $10^9$ GeV with a strongly suppressed coupling with the standard model, implying that the dark matter will be unobservable in direct as well as indirect measurements.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling is operative when the Standard Model (SM) bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. An attractive feature of this scenario is that it can be probed by direct detection experiments as well as at the LHC. In this work, we show how the mechanism can be realized in a simple UV complete framework, emphasizing the role of the maximal temperature of the SM thermal bath. We demonstrate that the maximal temperature can coincide with the reheating temperature or be close to it such that dark matter production is always Boltzmann-suppressed. This possibility is realized, for example, if the inflaton decays primarily into feebly interacting right-handed neutrinos, which subsequently generate the SM thermal bath. In this case, the SM sector temperature remains constant over cosmological times prior to reheating.</description>

Abstract: We suppose that there exist three vector hidden-charm tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ at the energy about $4.5\,\rm{GeV}$, and investigate the two-body strong decays systematically. We obtain thirty QCD sum rules for the hadronic coupling constants based on rigorous quark-hadron duality, then obtain the partial decay widths, therefore the total widths approximately, which are compatible with the experimental data of the $Y(4500)$ from the BESIII collaboration. The $Y(4500)$ may be one vector tetraquark state having three main Fock components, or consists of three different vector tetraquark states. We can search for the typical decays $ Y \to \frac{\bar{D}^0_1D^{0}-\bar{D}^{0}D^{0}_1}{\sqrt{2}}$,
  $\frac{\bar{D}^-_1D^{+}-\bar{D}^{-}D^{+}_1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\frac{\bar{D}^0_0D^{*0}-\bar{D}^{*0}D^{0}_0}{\sqrt{2}}$, $ \frac{\bar{D}^-_0D^{*+}-\bar{D}^{*-}D^{+}_0}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\eta_c\omega$, $J/\psi\omega$ to diagnose the nature of the $Y(4500)$.</description>

      <title>String Junctions Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements at the LHC have revealed heavy-flavour baryon fractions much larger than those observed at LEP, with e.g., LambdaC+/D0 and LambdaB0/B0 reaching ~ 0.5 at low pT. One scenario that has been at least partly successful in predicting observed trends is QCD colour reconnections with string junctions. In previous work, however, the limit of a low-pT heavy quark was not well defined. We reconsider the string equations of motion for junction systems in this limit, and find that the junction effectively becomes bound to the heavy quark, a scenario we refer to as a "pearl on a string". We extend string-junction fragmentation in Pythia with a dedicated modelling of this limit for both light- and heavy-quark "pearls".</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Unfolding with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent innovations from machine learning allow for data unfolding, without binning and including correlations across many dimensions. We describe a set of known, upgraded, and new methods for ML-based unfolding. The performance of these approaches are evaluated on the same two datasets. We find that all techniques are capable of accurately reproducing the particle-level spectra across complex observables. Given that these approaches are conceptually diverse, they offer an exciting toolkit for a new class of measurements that can probe the Standard Model with an unprecedented level of detail and may enable sensitivity to new phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized thermodynamic relations are introduced into the framework of a relativistic perfect spin hydrodynamics. They allow for consistent treatment of spin degrees of freedom, including the use of spin tensors whose structure follows from microscopic calculations. The obtained results are important for establishing consistency between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics and form the basis for introducing dissipative corrections.</description>

      <title>Tau polarization in neutrino-nucleus interactions at the LHC energy range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering that the study of neutrino-nucleus interactions with incident neutrino energy ranges in the GeV-TeV range is feasible at the Large Hadron Collider, we investigate in this paper the degree of polarization ${\cal{P}}$ of the (anti) tau lepton produced in (anti) tau neutrino - tungsten interactions. We estimate the differential cross-sections and the longitudinal and transverse components of the tau lepton polarization as a function of the tau lepton energy and distinct values of the scattering angle, assuming different values for the energy of the incoming (anti) tau neutrino. Different models for the treatment of the nuclear effects in the parton distribution functions are assumed as input in the calculations. Our results indicate that $ {\cal{P}} &lt; 1$ for the neutrino energies reached at the LHC and are almost insensitive to the nuclear effects.</description>

      <title>CaloDREAM -- Detector Response Emulation via Attentive flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detector simulations are an exciting application of modern generative networks. Their sparse high-dimensional data combined with the required precision poses a serious challenge. We show how combining Conditional Flow Matching with transformer elements allows us to simulate the detector phase space reliably. Namely, we use an autoregressive transformer to simulate the energy of each layer, and a vision transformer for the high-dimensional voxel distributions. We show how dimension reduction via latent diffusion allows us to train more efficiently and how diffusion networks can be evaluated faster with bespoke solvers. We showcase our framework, CaloDREAM, on datasets 2 and 3 of the CaloChallenge.</description>

      <title>How Gubser flow ends in a holographic conformal theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10384v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gubser flow is an axis-symmetric and boost-invariant evolution in a relativistic quantum field theory which is best studied by mapping $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$ to $dS_{3}\times \mathbf{R}$ when the field theory has conformal symmetry. We show that at late de-Sitter time, which corresponds to large proper time and central region of the future wedge within $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, the holographic conformal field theory plasma can reach a state in which $\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$, with $\varepsilon$, $P_T$ and $P_L$ being the energy density, transverse and longitudinal pressures, respectively. We further determine the full sub-leading behaviour of the energy-momentum tensor at late time. Restricting to flows in which the energy density decays at large transverse distance from the central axis in $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, we show that this decay should be faster than any power law. Furthermore, in this case the energy density also vanishes in $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$ faster than any power as we go back to early proper time. Hydrodynamic behavior can appear in intermediate time.</description>

      <title>Holography of Linear Dilaton Spacetimes from the Bottom Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear dilaton background is the keystone of a string-derived holographic correspondence beyond AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$. This motivates an exploration of the $(d+1)$-dimensional linear dilaton spacetime (LD$_{d+1}$) and its holographic properties from the low-energy viewpoint. We first notice that the LD$_{d+1}$ space has simple conformal symmetries, that we use to shape an effective field theory (EFT) on the LD background. We then place a brane in the background to study holography at the level of quantum fields and gravity. We find that the holographic correlators from the EFT feature a pattern of singularities at certain kinematic thresholds. We argue that such singularities can be used to bootstrap the putative $d$-dimensional dual theory using techniques analogous to those of the Cosmological Bootstrap program. Turning on finite temperature, we study the holographic fluid emerging on the brane in the presence of a bulk black hole. We find that the holographic fluid is pressureless for any $d$ due to a cancellation between Weyl curvature and dilaton stress tensor, and verify consistency with the time evolution of the theory. From the fluid thermodynamics, we find a universal temperature and Hagedorn behavior for any $d$. This matches the properties of a CFT$_2$ with large $T\overline T$ deformation, and of little string theory for $d=6$. Both the fluid equation of state and the spectrum of quantum fluctuations suggest that the $d$-dimensional dual theory arising from LD$_{d+1}$ is generically gapped.</description>

      <title>High-energy behavior of scattering amplitudes in theories with purely virtual particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of renormalizable quantum field theories with purely virtual particles that exhibits nonrenormalizable behavior in the high-energy limit of scattering cross sections, which grow as powers of the center-of-mass energy squared and seems to violate unitarity bounds. We point out that the problem should be viewed as a violation of perturbativity, instead of unitarity, and show that the resummation of self energies fixes the issue. As an explicit example, we consider a class of $O(N)$ theories at the leading order in the large-$N$ expansion and show that the different quantization prescription of purely virtual particles takes care of the nonrenormalizable behavior, making the resummed cross sections to decrease at high energies and the amplitudes to satisfy the unitarity bounds. We compare the results to the case of theories with ghosts, where the resummation cannot change the behavior of cross sections due to certain cancellations in the high-energy expansion of the self energies. These results are particularly relevant for quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>A comparative lattice analysis of $SU(2)$ dark gluebal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mass and scattering cross section of $SU(2)$ glueballs as dark matter candidates using lattice simulations. We employ both naive and improved $SU(2)$ gauge actions in $3+1$ dimensions with several $\beta$ values, and adopt both the traditional Monte Carlo method and the flow-based model based on machine learning techniques to generate lattice configurations. The mass of dark scalar glueball with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ and the NBS wave function are calculated. Using a coupling constant of $\beta=2.2$ as an illustration, we compare the dark glueball mass calculated from the configurations generated from the two methods. While consistent results can be achieved, the two methods demonstrate distinct advantages. Using the Runge-Kutta method, we extract the glueball interaction potential and two-body scattering cross section. From the observational constraints, we obtain the lower bound of the mass of scalar glueball as candidates of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming a toroidal space with finite volume, we derive analytically the full one-loop vacuum energy for a scalar field tunnelling between two degenerate vacua, taking into account discrete momentum. The Casimir energy is computed for an arbitrary number of dimensions using the Abel-Plana formula, while the one-loop instanton functional determinant is evaluated using the Green's functions for the fluctuation operators. The resulting energetic properties are non-trivial: both the Casimir effect and tunnelling contribute to the Null Energy Condition violation, arising from a non-extensive true vacuum energy. We discuss the relevance of this mechanism to induce a cosmic bounce, requiring no modified gravity or exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Search for a light muon-philic $Z'$ with the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of an additional U(1) gauge $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ symmetry would release the tension between the measured and the predicted value of the anomalous muon magnetic moment: this paradigm assumes the existence of a new, light $Z'$ vector boson, with dominant coupling to ${\mu}$ and ${\tau}$ and interacting with electrons via a loop mechanism. The $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ model can also explain the Dark Matter relic abundance, by assuming that the $Z'$ boson acts as a "portal" to a new Dark Sector of particles in Nature, not charged under known interactions. In this work we present the results of the $Z'$ search performed by the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN SPS, that collected $ \sim 9 \times 10^{11}$ 100-GeV electrons impinging on an active thick target. Despite the suppressed $Z'$ production yield with an electron beam, the limits sets by NA64-$e$ are competitive with other experimental searches, and partially exclude the $g-2$ preferred model parameter values for $Z'$ masses lighter than 2 MeV. This result proves the complementarity of this search with NA64-${\mu}$, the parallel effort of the NA64 collaboration with a muon beam.</description>
