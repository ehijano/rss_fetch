Abstract: We present a way to We present a way to fabricate bicrystal Josephson junctions of high-Tc cuprate superconductors that does not require bulk bicrystalline substrates. Based on vector substrate technology, this novel approach makes use of a few tens-of-nanometers-thick bicrystalline membranes transferred onto conventional substrates.We demonstrate 24{\deg} YBa2Cu3O7-x Josephson junctions fabricated on sapphire single crystals by utilizing 10-nm-thick bicrystalline membranes of SrTiO3. This technique allows one to manufacture bicrystalline Josephson junctions of high-Tc superconductors on a large variety of bulk substrate materials, providing novel degrees of freedom in designing the junctions and their electronic properties. It furthermore offers the capability to replace the fabrication of bulk bicrystalline substrates with thin-film growth methods</description>

      <title>Extreme Elastic Deformation of Atoms and Pressure-Induced Superconductivity in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change in the interatomic spacing of a two-atom system under tension and compression has been modelled by the elastic deformation of atoms. The critical elastic strain of atoms before separation or cracking from tension was estimated by the Griffith theory together with a recent mechanics model, then extended to the lateral elastic expansion under uniaxial compression. The hypothesis of deformable atoms has led to astonishing predictions of the critical elastic strain, around 10 and 20 percent for silicon in the 110 and 100 crystal directions. Superimposed by the substantial reduction of interatomic spacing in the direction of uniaxial compression above 20 GPa, these severely deformed silicon atoms or metastable new variants have acquired unforeseeable characteristics and properties, vastly different from those of silicon atoms under moderate stresses. Under extreme pressure, the natural repulsive reaction of atoms is intensified due to the increasing alignment of electron orbitals along the pressure direction and formation of metastable pressure-resistant phases. An opportunity for creation of a superconductive band has thus arisen at the edge of the laterally elastically expanded region away from the nuclei, where more space is available for free electron movement. Diamond results were also used to validate the new mechanics model, including the effects of atomic scale defects on fracture strain and strength, critical to elastic strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect in a junction coupled to an electron reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the scattering theory of the Josephson effect to include a coupling of the Josephson junction to a gapless electron reservoir in the normal state. By opening up the system with a quasiparticle escape rate $1/\tau$, the supercurrent carried at zero temperature by an Andreev level at energy $\varepsilon_{\rm A}$ is reduced by a factor $(2/\pi)\arctan(2\varepsilon_{\rm A}\tau/\hbar)$ . We make contact with recent work on "non-Hermitian Josephson junctions", by comparing this result to different proposed generalizations of the Josephson effect to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Record high superconducting transition temperature in Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloy with rich magnetic element Mn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that magnetic moments are very harmful to superconductivity. A typical example is the element Mn whose compounds usually exhibit strong magnetism. Thus, it is very hard to achieve superconductivity in materials containing Mn. Here, we report enhanced superconductivity with the superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) up to a record high-value of about 26 K in a beta-phase Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloy containing rich magnetic element Mn under high pressures. This is contrary to the intuition that the magnetic moments always suppress superconductivity. Under high pressures, we also found that in the middle-pressure regime, the Pauli limit of the upper critical field is surpassed. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction data shows an unchanged beta-phase with a continuous contraction of the cell volume, which is well supported by the first-principles calculations. Although the theoretical results based on electron-phonon coupling (EPC) can interpret the $T_\text{c}$ value in a certain pressure region, the monotonic enhancement of superconductivity by pressure cannot seek support from the theory. Our results show a surprising enhancement of superconductivity in Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloy with a considerable Mn content.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Integration of Transient Phenomena in No-Insulation Superconducting Coils Using Parareal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have the potential to enable magnetic fields beyond the current limits of low-temperature superconductors in applications like accelerator magnets. However, the design of HTS-based magnets requires computationally demanding transient multi-physics simulations with highly non-linear material properties. To reduce the solution time, we propose using Parareal (PR) for parallel-in-time magneto-thermal simulation of magnets based on HTS, particularly, no-insulation coils without turn-to-turn insulation. We propose extending the classical PR method to automatically find a time partitioning using a first coarse adaptive propagator. The proposed PR method is shown to reduce the computing time when fine engineering tolerances are required despite the highly nonlinear character of the problem. The full software stack used is open-source.</description>

      <title>Boosting the STM's spatial and energy resolution with double-functionalized probe tips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering of superconducting pairs by magnetic impurities on a superconducting surface leads to pairs of sharp in-gap resonances, known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states. Similarly to the interference of itinerant electrons scattered by defects in normal metals, these resonances reveal a periodic texture around the magnetic impurity. However, the wavelength of these resonances is often too short to be resolved even by methods capable of atomic resolution, like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Here, we combine a CO molecule with a superconducting cluster pre-attached to an STM tip to maximize both spatial and energy resolution. The superior properties of such a double-functionalized probe are demonstrated by imaging the spatial distribution of YSR states around magnetic Fe atoms on a Nb(110) surface. Our approach reveals rich interference patterns of the hybridized YSR state, previously inaccessible with conventional STM probes. This advancement extends the capabilities of STM techniques, providing insights into superconducting phenomena at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Probing the superconducting pairing of the La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ alloy via muon-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a study of the superconducting pairing of the noncentrosymmetric La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ alloy using muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) technique. Below $T_c = 2.4$ K, La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ exhibits bulk superconductivity (SC), here characterized by heat-capacity and magnetic-susceptibility measurements. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density $\rho_\mathrm{sc}(T)$, extracted from the transverse-field {\textmu}SR measurements, reveals a nodeless SC in La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$. The best fit of $\rho_\mathrm{sc}(T)$ using an $s$-wave model yields a magnetic penetration depth $\lambda_0 = 542$ nm and a superconducting gap $\Delta_0 = 0.37$ meV at zero Kelvin. The single-gapped superconducting state is further evidenced by the temperature-dependent electronic specific heat $C_\mathrm{e}(T)/T$ and the linear field-dependent electronic specific-heat coefficient $\gamma_\mathrm{H}(H)$. The zero-field $\mu$SR spectra collected in the normal- and superconducting states of La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ are almost identical, confirming the absence of an additional field-related relaxation and, thus, of spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_c$. The nodeless SC combined with a preserved time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state prove that the spin-singlet pairing is dominant in La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$. This material represents yet another example of a complex system showing only a conventional behavior, in spite of a noncentrosymmetric structure and a sizeable spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>A Replica-BCS theory for dirty superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of the anomalous metal state in superconductor thin films, we revisit in this paper the problem of dirty superconductors using a replica-symmetric BCS (RS-BCS) theory for dirty metals with net attractive interactions. Within the RS-BCS mean field theory, we show that the (dirty) superconductor transits to a Cooper-pair-glass state beyond a critical strength of disorder. The single particle tunneling density of states and the superfluid density are computed within the RS-BCS theory for different strengths of disorder. We find that the single-particle spectral gap is strongly enhanced by disorder and the superfluid density reduces rapidly from the corresponding clean superconducting limit with increasing strength of disorder but remains finite in the Cooper-pair-glass state. The nature of the Cooper-pair-glass state and relevance of our result to the anomalous metal state are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Common behavior of the scaled condensation energy for both high-$T_c$ and conventional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the scaling of the condensation energy $E_{\Delta}$ divided by $\gamma$, $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\simeq N(0)\Delta_1^2/\gamma$, of both conventional superconductors and unconventional high-$T_c$ one, where $N(0)$ is the density of states, $\Delta_1$ is the maximum value of the superconducting gap and $\gamma$ is the Sommerfeld coefficient. For the first time, we show that the universal scaling of $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\propto T_c^2$ applies equally to conventional superconductors and unconventional high-$T_c$ ones. Our consideration is based on both facts: Bogoliubov quasiparticles act in conventional and unconventional superconductors, and the corresponding flat band is deformed by the unconventional superconducting state. As a result, our theoretical observations based on the fermion condensation theory are in good agreement with experimental facts.</description>

Abstract: We study theoretically a setup consisting of excitons formed in two valleys, with proximity-induced Cooper pairing, different in conduction and valence bands. Due to the combination of Coulomb interaction with superconducting proximity effects, Cooper pairing between electrons from conduction and valence bands from different valleys is formed. This finite-energy intervalley Cooper pairing has both even- and odd-frequency contributions. We show that there is a phase transition into formation of a robust macroscopic condensate of such Cooper pairs and present characteristics of the corresponding Higgs modes.</description>

      <title>Band-Geometric Origin of Superconducting Diode Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonreciprocal critical supercurrents endow the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, it was reported that the SDE has been observed in narrow-band superconductors such as twisted trilayer graphene with zero magnetic field. In this work, we unveil the SDE in superconductors that host narrow bands near Fermi energy, where the supercurrent has a significant contribution from the wave-function quantum geometry. By establishing the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, we show that besides the conventional band dispersion effect arising from the Fermi surface asymmetry, the microscopic origin of SDE from quantum geometry is the quantum metric dipole. Importantly, in the flat-band limit where the attractive interaction strength is much larger than the bandwidth, the supercurrent and diode effect contributed from quantum geometry becomes the leading order. The interaction-driven valley polarization which lifts the valley degeneracy is also necessary. Our work reveals a band-geometric origin of nonreciprocity in narrow-band superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impacts of the quantum geometry of Bloch states, specifically through the band-resolved quantum-metric tensor, on Cooper pairing and flat-band superconductivity in a three-dimensional pyrochlore-Hubbard model. First we analyze the low-lying two-body spectrum exactly, and show that the pairing order parameter is uniform in this four-band lattice. This allowed us to establish direct relations between the superfluid weight of a multiband superconductor and ($i$) the effective mass of the lowest-lying two-body branch at zero temperature, ($ii$) the kinetic coefficient of the Ginzburg-Landau theory in proximity to the critical temperature, and ($iii$) the velocity of the low-energy Goldstone modes at zero temperature. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive numerical analysis of the superfluid weight and Goldstone modes, exploring both their conventional and geometric components at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Irreversible entropy transport enhanced by fermionic superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of particle and entropy flow between two superfluids is often understood in terms of reversible flow carried by an entropy-free, macroscopic wavefunction. While this wavefunction is responsible for many intriguing properties of superfluids and superconductors, its interplay with excitations in non-equilibrium situations is less understood. Here, we observe large concurrent flows of both particles and entropy through a ballistic channel connecting two strongly interacting fermionic superfluids. Both currents respond nonlinearly to chemical potential and temperature biases. We find that the entropy transported per particle is much larger than the prediction of superfluid hydrodynamics in the linear regime and largely independent of changes in the channel's geometry. In contrast, the timescales of advective and diffusive entropy transport vary significantly with the channel geometry. In our setting, superfluidity counterintuitively increases the speed of entropy transport. Moreover, we develop a phenomenological model describing the nonlinear dynamics within the framework of generalised gradient dynamics. Our approach for measuring entropy currents may help elucidate mechanisms of heat transfer in superfluids and superconducting devices.</description>
