      <title>Bridging statistical mechanics and thermodynamics away from equilibrium: a data-driven approach for learning internal variables and their dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics with internal variables is a common approach in continuum mechanics to model inelastic (i.e., non-equilibrium) material behavior. While this approach is computationally and theoretically attractive, it currently lacks a well-established statistical mechanics foundation. As a result, internal variables are typically chosen phenomenologically and lack a direct link to the underlying physics which hinders the predictability of the theory. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning approach that is consistent with the principles of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The proposed approach leverages the following techniques (i) the information bottleneck (IB) method to ensure that the learned internal variables are functions of the microstates and are capable of capturing the salient feature of the microscopic distribution; (ii) conditional normalizing flows to represent arbitrary probability distributions of the microscopic states as functions of the state variables; and (iii) Variational Onsager Neural Networks (VONNs) to guarantee thermodynamic consistency and Markovianity of the learned evolution equations. The resulting framework, called IB-VONNs, is tested on two problems of colloidal systems, governed at the microscale by overdamped Langevin dynamics. The first one is a prototypical model for a colloidal particle in an optical trap, which can be solved analytically, and thus ideal to verify the framework. The second problem is a one-dimensional phase-transforming system, whose macroscopic description still lacks a statistical mechanics foundation under general conditions. The results in both cases indicate that the proposed machine learning strategy can indeed bridge statistical mechanics and thermodynamics with internal variables away from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.</description>

      <title>Optimal performance of thermoelectric devices with small external irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the thermodynamic analysis of thermoelectric devices, typical irreversibilities are for the processes of finite-rate heat transfer and Joule heating. Approximate analyses often focus on either internal or external irreversibility, yielding well-known expressions for the efficiency at maximum power (EMP), such as the Curzon-Ahlborn value for endoreversible model and the Schmiedl-Seifert form for exoreversible model. Within the Constant Properties model, we formulate a scenario that incorporates internal as well as external irreversibilities simultaneously. We employ the approximation of a symmetric and small external irreversibility (SEI), confining to the regime where the external conductance of the heat exchangers is large in comparison to the internal thermal conductance of the thermoelectric material. This approach allows us to derive a general expression for EMP, which depends on the ratio of internal to external conductance, apart from the figure of merit and ratio of temperatures. Extending our study to thermoelectric refrigerators under the similar assumptions, we also analyze the efficiency at maximum cooling power.</description>

      <title>Dissipation bounds the coherence of stochastic limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overdamped stochastic systems maintained far from equilibrium can display sustained oscillations with fluctuations that decrease with the system size. The correlation time of such noisy limit cycles expressed in units of the cycle period is upper-bounded by the entropy produced per oscillation. We prove this constraint for first-order nonlinear systems in arbitrary dimensions perturbed by weak, uncorrelated Gaussian noise. We then extend the result to important examples of more general stochastic dynamics, including electronic and chemical clocks, illustrating the practical relevance of the dissipation-coherence bound for electronic computing and thermodynamic inference.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the free energy, entropy and specific heat for planar Ising models: Application to Archimedean lattices and their duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2d ferromagnetic Ising model was solved by Onsager on the square lattice in 1944, and an explicit expression of the free energy density $f$ is presently available for some other planar lattices. An exact derivation of the critical temperature $T_c$ only requires a partial derivation of $f$ and has been performed on many lattices, including the 11 Archimedean lattices. We give general expressions of the free energy, energy, entropy and specific heat for planar lattices with a single type of non-crossing links. The specific heat exhibits a logarithmic singularity at $T_c$: $c_V(T)\sim -A\ln|1-T_c/T|$, in all the ferromagnetic and some antiferromagnetic cases. While the non-universal weight $A$ of the leading term has often been evaluated, this is not the case for the sub-leading order term $B$ such that $c_V(T)+A\ln|1-T_c/T|\sim B$, despite its strong impact on $c_V(T)$ values in the vicinity of $T_c$, particularly important in experimental measurements. Explicit values of these thermodynamic quantities and of $A$ and $B$ are given for the Archimedean lattices and their dual for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the mixing time of driven-dissipative activated random walk on an interval of length $n$ with uniform or central driving exhibits cutoff at $n$ times the critical density for activated random walk on the integers. The proof uses a new result for arbitrary graphs showing that the chain is mixed once activity is likely at every site.</description>

      <title>Athermal creep deformation of ultrastable amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the athermal creep deformation of amorphous materials having a wide range of stability. The imposed shear stress serves as the control parameter, allowing us to examine the time-dependent transient response through both the macroscopic strain and microscopic observables. Least stable samples exhibit monotonicity in the transient strain rate versus time, while more stable samples display a pronounced non-monotonic S-shaped curve, corresponding to failure by sharp shear band formation. We identify a diverging timescale associated with the fluidization process and extract the corresponding critical exponents. Our results are compared with predictions from existing scaling theories relevant to soft matter systems. The numerical findings for stable, brittle-like materials represent a challenge for theoretical descriptions. We monitor the microscopic initiation of shear bands during creep responses. Our study encompasses creep deformation across a variety of materials ranging from ductile soft matter to brittle metallic and oxide glasses, all within the same numerical framework.</description>

      <title>Local Basis Transformation to Mitigate Negative Sign Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for the frustrated quantum spin systems occasionally suffer from the negative sign problem, which makes simulations exponentially harder for larger systems at lower temperatures and severely limits QMC's application across a wide range of spin systems. This problem is known to depend on the choice of representation basis. We propose a systematic approach for mitigating the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian or lattice structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to characterize the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the existence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function, which effectively approximates negativity, especially in frustration-free systems. Using the proposed loss function, we demonstrate that optimizing the representation basis can mitigate the negative sign. This is evidenced by several frustration-free models and other important quantum spin systems. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unitary transformations against the standard orthogonal transformation and reveal that unitary transformations can effectively mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Dynamics with Simultaneous Dissipations to Fermionic and Bosonic Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-phenomenological framework based on the influence functional method to incorporate simultaneous interactions of particles with fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs. In the slow-motion limit, the electronic friction kernel becomes Markovian, enabling an analytical expression for the friction coefficient. The framework is applied to a prototypical electrochemical system, where the metal electrode and solvent act as fermionic and bosonic reservoirs, respectively. We investigate quantum vibrational relaxation of hydrogen on metal surfaces, showing that dissipation to electron-hole pairs reduces the relaxation time. Additionally, in solvated proton discharge, electronic friction prolongs charge transfer by delaying proton transitions between potential wells. This study provides new insights into the interplay of solvent and electronic dissipation effects, with direct relevance to electrochemical processes and other systems involving multiple thermal reservoirs.</description>

      <title>The Floquet central spin model: A platform to realize eternal time crystals, entanglement steering, and multiparameter metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and characterize protocols to realize eternal discrete time crystals (DTCs) in the periodically driven central spin model. These eternal DTCs exhibit perfect periodic revivals of the initial state at a time $mnT$ (where $n&gt;1$ and $\{m,n\} \in \mathbb{Z}$), when the Ising interaction strength, $\lambda$ between the central spin and the satellite spins is tuned to certain values. The combination of perfect initial-state revival and time-translation-symmetry breaking leads to infinitely long-lived oscillations of the stroboscopic magnetization and the entanglement entropy in these DTCs even for a finite number of satellite spins. We analytically determine the conditions for the existence of these eternal DTCs and prove that the system exhibits eternal period-doubling oscillations ($n=2$) when $\lambda = 2 \pi$ for an arbitrary number of satellite spins. Furthermore, we propose a protocol to realize eternal higher-order(HO)-DTCs ($n&gt;2$) by tuning $\lambda$ to $\pi$. Intriguingly, this protocol naturally steers the system through an entangled trajectory, thereby leading to the generation of maximally entangled Bell-cat states during the dynamical evolution of the HO-DTC. Finally, we demonstrate that these HO-DTCs can serve as a resource for Heisenberg-limited multiparameter sensing.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics in isolated quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is believed that an isolated quantum many-body system far away from equilibrium should try to attain equilibrium via a mechanism whereby any given subsystem acts as an open quantum system that is coupled to an environment which is the complementary part of the full system and undergoing a complicated equilibration process such that all the subsystems in the long-time limit attain equilibrium states compatible with the global equilibrium state. This picture begs the question whether the dynamics of any given subsystem is Markovian (monotonic loss of information and memory) or non-Markovian. In this work, by numerically probing the dynamical behaviour of the distance between \textit{temporally-separated} subsystem states, we reveal the telltale signatures and other associated features of quantum (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics of small subsystems of an isolated quantum spin system in one dimension (the Ising spin chain) brought far from equilibrium by quantum quenches. Additionally, remarkably systematic behaviour is seen in the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the subsystems. These features strongly depend on the direction of quenching in the parameter space, with paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic quenches offering considerably stronger signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity, for which we offer heuristic arguments.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.</description>

      <title>Optimal generalisation and learning transition in extensive-width shallow neural networks near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a teacher-student model of supervised learning with a fully-trained 2-layer neural network whose width $k$ and input dimension $d$ are large and proportional. We compute the Bayes-optimal generalisation error of the network for any activation function in the regime where the number of training data $n$ scales quadratically with the input dimension, i.e., around the interpolation threshold where the number of trainable parameters $kd+k$ and of data points $n$ are comparable. Our analysis tackles generic weight distributions. Focusing on binary weights, we uncover a discontinuous phase transition separating a "universal" phase from a "specialisation" phase. In the first, the generalisation error is independent of the weight distribution and decays slowly with the sampling rate $n/d^2$, with the student learning only some non-linear combinations of the teacher weights. In the latter, the error is weight distribution-dependent and decays faster due to the alignment of the student towards the teacher network. We thus unveil the existence of a highly predictive solution near interpolation, which is however potentially hard to find.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pinning-depinning phase transitions of interfaces for two classes of discrete elastic-string models are investigated numerically. In the (1+1)-dimensions, we revisit these two elastic-string models with slight modification to growth rule, and compare the estimated values with the previous numerical and experimental results. For the (2+1)-dimensional case, we perform extensive simulations on pinning-depinning transitions in these { discrete models with quenched disorder}. For full comparisons in the physically relevant spatial dimensions, we also perform numerically two distinct universality classes, including the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (QEW), and the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (QKPZ) equations with and without external driving forces. The critical exponents of these {systems in the presence of quenched disorder} are numerically estimated. Our results show that the critical exponents satisfy scaling relations well, and these two discrete elastic-string models do not fall into the existing universality classes. In order to visually comparisons of these {discrete systems with quenched disorder} in the (2+1)-dimensional cases, we present surface morphologies with various external driving forces during the saturated time regimes. The relationships between surface morphologies, scaling exponents and correlation length are also revealed.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

      <title>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19279v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems leading to a universal description of the nature of information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Origin of Limit Cycles, Fixed Points, and Critical Slowing Down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the most iconic features of classical dissipative dynamics are persistent limit-cycle oscillations and critical slowing down at the onset of such oscillations, where the system relaxes purely algebraically in time. On the other hand, quantum systems subject to generic Markovian dissipation decohere exponentially in time, approaching a unique steady state. Here we show how coherent limit-cycle oscillations and algebraic decay can emerge in a quantum system governed by a Markovian master equation as one approaches the classical limit, illustrating general mechanisms using a single-spin model and a two-site lossy Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we demonstrate that the fingerprint of a limit cycle is a slow-decaying branch with vanishing decoherence rates in the Liouville spectrum, while a power-law decay is realized by a spectral collapse at the bifurcation point. We also show how these are distinct from the case of a classical fixed point, for which the quantum spectrum is gapped and can be generated from the linearized classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Zeros in Quantum Phase Transition: An Entanglement Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Yang-Lee theory in quantum phase transitions from the perspective of quantum entanglement in one-dimensional many-body systems. We primarily focus on the distribution of Yang-Lee zeros and its associated Yang-Lee edge singularity of two prototypical models: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the \emph{XXZ} spin chain. By taking the zero-temperature limit, we show how the Yang-Lee zeros approach the quantum phase transition points on the complex plane of parameters. To characterize the edge singularity induced by Yang-Lee zeros in quantum phase transition, we introduce the entanglement entropy of the ground state to show that the edges of Yang-Lee zeros lead to the ground-state entanglement transition. We further show that our results are also applicable to the general non-interacting parity-time-symmetric Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa&gt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa&lt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in $\ell_1$ Regularized Regression: Hyperparameter Selection Strategy based on Sharp Asymptotic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning techniques aim to leverage information from multiple related datasets to enhance prediction quality against a target dataset. Such methods have been adopted in the context of high-dimensional sparse regression, and some Lasso-based algorithms have been invented: Trans-Lasso and Pretraining Lasso are such examples. These algorithms require the statistician to select hyperparameters that control the extent and type of information transfer from related datasets. However, selection strategies for these hyperparameters, as well as the impact of these choices on the algorithm's performance, have been largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a thorough, precise study of the algorithm in a high-dimensional setting via an asymptotic analysis using the replica method. Our approach reveals a surprisingly simple behavior of the algorithm: Ignoring one of the two types of information transferred to the fine-tuning stage has little effect on generalization performance, implying that efforts for hyperparameter selection can be significantly reduced. Our theoretical findings are also empirically supported by applications on real-world and semi-artificial datasets using the IMDb and MNIST datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

      <title>The quantum magic of fermionic Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of magic in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in magic at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Photon-assisted stochastic resonance in nanojunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic resonance in molecular junctions driven by a periodically-varying external field. This is done using the time-dependent Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker formalism, which follows from exact analytical solutions to the Kadanoff-Baym equations describing the molecular junction subject to an arbitrary time-dependent bias. We focus on a double quantum dot nanojunction and compare the effects of the temperature with the fluctuating bias in the statically-driven case. We then consider the combined effect of AC-driving and white noise fluctuations on the rectified current through the nanojunction, and find a stochastic resonance effect, where at certain driving conditions the bias fluctuations enhance the current signal. The study is then extended to include the color noise in the applied bias, so that the combined effect of the color noise correlation time and driving frequency on stochastic resonance is investigated. We thereby demonstrate that photon-assisted transport can be optimized by a suitably tuned environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study perturbative Wilsonian renormalisation group (RG) for the scalar $\phi^4$ theory at finite temperature to one loop order in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path (CTP) formalism. By explicitly integrating out the UV modes, we show how effective interactions coupling the two branches of the CTP contour arise. This provides a microscopic derivation of the type of effective CTP actions used in the literature. While the full effective theory has no critical points, we instead proceed to study critical properties of the RG flow in a reduced space of complex couplings that characterise certain time-ordered correlators and show the existence of two novel fixed points in $d=4$ spacetime dimensions. We relate one to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point known to exist only in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions, and the other to the standard Gaussian fixed point.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant, both in R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>
