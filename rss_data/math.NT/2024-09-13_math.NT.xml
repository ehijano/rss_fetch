      <title>A six-functor formalism for quasi-coherent sheaves and crystals on rigid-analytic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of derived rigid spaces and quasi-coherent sheaves and analytic crystals on them. Amongst other things, we obtain a six-functor formalism for these quasi-coherent sheaves and analytic crystals. We provide evidence that the category of analytic crystals is related to the theory of D-cap-modules introduced by Ardakov--Wadsley.</description>

      <title>On the positivity and integrality of coefficients of mirror maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present natural conjectural generalizations of the `positivity and integrality of mirror maps' phenomenon, encompassing the mirror maps appearing in the Batyrev--Borisov construction of mirror Calabi--Yau complete intersections in Fano toric varieties as a special case. We find that, given the combinatorial data from which one constructs a mirror pair of Calabi--Yau complete intersections, there are two ways of writing down an associated `mirror map': one which is the `true mirror map', meaning the one which appears in mirror symmetry theorems; and one which is the `naive mirror map'. The two are equal under a certain combinatorial criterion which holds e.g. for the quintic threefold, but not in general. We conjecture (based on substantial computer checks, together with proofs under extra hypotheses) that the naive mirror map always has positive integer coefficients, while the true mirror map always has integer (but not necessarily positive) coefficients. Almost all previous works on the integrality of mirror maps concern the naive mirror map, and in particular, only apply to the true mirror map under the combinatorial criterion mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Universal sums of generalized polygonal numbers of almost prime "length"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider sums of three generalized $m$-gonal numbers whose parameters are restricted to integers with a bounded number of prime divisors. With some restrictions on $m$ modulo $30$, we show that a density one set of integers is represented as such a sum, where the parameters are restricted to have at most 6361 prime factors. Moreover, if the squarefree part of $f_m(n)$ is sufficiently large, then $n$ is represented as such a sum, where $f_m(n)$ is a natural linear function in $n$.</description>

      <title>General Dynamics and Generation Mapping for Collatz-type Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let an odd integer \(\mathcal{X}\) be expressed as $\left\{\sum\limits_{M &gt; m}b_M2^M\right\}+2^m-1,$ where $b_M\in\{0,1\}$ and $2^m-1$ is referred to as the Governor. In Collatz-type functions, a high index Governor is eventually reduced to $2^1-1$. For the $3\mathcal{Z}+1$ sequence, the Governor occurring in the Trivial cycle is $2^1-1$, while for the $5\mathcal{Z}+1$ sequence, the Trivial Governors are $2^2-1$ and $2^1-1$. Therefore, in these specific sequences, the Collatz function reduces the Governor $2^m - 1$ to the Trivial Governor $2^{\mathcal{T}} - 1$. Once this Trivial Governor is reached, it can evolve to a higher index Governor through interactions with other terms. This feature allows $\mathcal{X}$ to reappear in a Collatz-type sequence, since $2^m - 1 = 2^{m - 1} + \cdots + 2^{\mathcal{T} + 1} + 2^{\mathcal{T}}+(2^{\mathcal{T}}-1).$ Thus, if $\mathcal{X}$ reappears, at least one odd ancestor of $\left\{\sum\limits_{M &gt; m}b_M2^M\right\}+2^{m-1}+\cdots+2^{\mathcal{T}+1}+2^{\mathcal{T}}+(2^{\mathcal{T}}-1)$ must have the Governor $2^m-1$. Ancestor mapping shows that all odd ancestors of $\mathcal{X}$ have the Trivial Governor for the respective Collatz sequence. This implies that odd integers that repeat in the $3\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence have the Governor $2^1 - 1$, while those forming a repeating cycle in the $5\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence have either $2^2 - 1$ or $2^1 - 1$ as the Governor. Successor mapping for the $3\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence further indicates that there are no auxiliary cycles, as the Trivial Governor is always transformed into a different index Governor. Similarly, successor mapping for the $5\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence reveals that the smallest odd integers forming an auxiliary cycle are smaller than $2^5$. Finally, attempts to identify integers that diverge for the $3\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence suggest that no such integers exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider generalized quadratic forms over real quadratic number fields and prove, under a natural positive-definiteness condition, that a generalized quadratic form can only be universal if it contains a quadratic subform that is universal. We also construct an example illustrating that the positive-definiteness condition is necessary.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we provide evidence for a certain twisted version of the parity conjecture for Jacobians, introduced in prior work of V. Dokchitser, Green, Konstantinou and the author. To do this, we use arithmetic duality theorems for abelian varieties to study the determinant of certain endomorphisms acting on p-infinity Selmer groups.</description>

      <title>On determinants involving $(\frac{j+k}p)\pm(\frac{j-k}p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p=2n+1$ be an odd prime. In this paper, we mainly evaluate determinants involving $(\frac {j+k}p)\pm(\frac{j-k}p)$, where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol. When $p\equiv1\pmod4$, we determine the characteristic polynomials of the matrices $$\left[\left(\frac{j+k}p\right)+\left(\frac{j-k}p\right)\right]_{1\le j,k\le n}\ \ \text{and}\ \ \left[\left(\frac{j+k}p\right)-\left(\frac{j-k}p\right)\right]_{1\le j,k\le n},$$ and also prove that \begin{align*} &amp;\ \left|x+\left(\frac{j+k}p\right)+\left(\frac{j-k}p\right)+\left(\frac jp\right)y+\left(\frac kp\right)z+\left(\frac{jk}p\right)w\right|_{1\le j,k\le n} \\=&amp;\ (-p)^{(p-5)/4}\left(\left(\frac{p-1}2\right)^2wx-\left(\frac{p-1}2y-1\right)\left(\frac{p-1}2z-1\right)\right), \end{align*} which was previously conjectured by the second author.</description>

      <title>Uniform polynomial bounds on torsion from rational geometric isogeny classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1996, Merel showed there exists a function $B\colon \mathbb{Z}^+\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that for any elliptic curve $E/F$ defined over a number field of degree $d$, one has the torsion group bound $\# E(F)[\textrm{tors}]\leq B(d)$. Based on subsequent work, it is conjectured that one can choose $B$ to be polynomial in the degree $d$. In this paper, we show that such bounds exist for torsion from the family $\mathcal{I}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ of elliptic curves which are geometrically isogenous to at least one rational elliptic curve. More precisely, we show that for each $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $c_\epsilon&gt;0$ such that for any elliptic curve $E/F\in \mathcal{I}_{\mathbb{Q}}$, one has \[ \# E(F)[\textrm{tors}]\leq c_\epsilon\cdot [F:\mathbb{Q}]^{5+\epsilon}. \] This generalizes prior work of Clark and Pollack, as well as work of the second author in the case of rational geometric isogeny classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two distinct discrete forms of Appell function $F_2$. We determine their convergence domains, integral representations as well as difference-differential equations that are satisfied by these discrete analogues of $F_2$. We have also obtained the difference-differential formulas, finite and infinite summation formulas, and a complete list of difference-differential recursion relations obeyed by these discrete functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the following result: If $X_0$ is an affine surface over a field $K$ and $f, g$ are two loxodromic automorphisms with an orbit meeting infinitely many times, then $f$ and $g$ must share a common iterate. The proof uses the preliminary work of the author in [Abb23] on the dynamics of endomorphisms of affine surfaces and arguments from arithmetic dynamics. We then show a dynamical Mordell-Lang type result for surfaces in $X_0 \times X_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The toric fundamental group is the smallest extension of the \'etale fundamental group which can manage the monodromy of line bundles, in addition to the monodromy of finite \'etale covers. It is an extension of the \'etale fundamental group by a projective limit of tori.
  We prove the analogue of Grothendieck's section conjecture for the toric fundamental group over finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.</description>

      <title>An inverse theorem for the Gowers $U^3$-norm relative to quadratic level sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an effective version of the inverse theorem for the Gowers $U^3$-norm for functions supported on high-rank quadratic level sets in finite vector spaces. For configurations controlled by the $U^3$-norm (complexity-two configurations), this enables one to run a density increment argument with respect to quadratic level sets, which are analogues of Bohr sets in the context of quadratic Fourier analysis on finite vector spaces. We demonstrate such an argument by deriving an exponential bound on the Ramsey number of three-term progressions which are the same colour as their common difference (``Brauer quadruples''), a result we have been unable to establish by other means.
  Our methods also yield polylogarithmic bounds on the density of sets lacking translation-invariant configurations of complexity two. Such bounds for four-term progressions were obtained by Green and Tao using a simpler weak-regularity argument. In an appendix, we give an example of how to generalise Green and Tao's argument to other translation-invariant configurations of complexity two. However, this crucially relies on an estimate coming from the Croot-Lev-Pach polynomial method, which may not be applicable to all systems of complexity two. Hence running a density increment with respect to quadratic level sets may still prove useful for such problems. It may also serve as a model for running density increments on more general nil-Bohr sets, with a view to effectivising other Szemer\'edi-type theorems.</description>

Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Differential transcendence of Bell numbers and relatives: a Galois theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.15292v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2003 Klazar proved that the ordinary generating function of the sequence of Bell numbers is differentially transcendental over the field $\mathbb{C}(\{t\})$ of meromorphic functions at $0$. We show that Klazar's result is an instance of a general phenomenon that can be proven in a compact way using difference Galois theory. We present the main principles of this theory in order to prove a general result about differential transcendence over $\mathbb{C}(\{t\})$, that we apply to many other (infinite classes of) examples of generating functions, including as very special cases the ones considered by Klazar. Most of our examples belong to Sheffer's class, well studied notably in umbral calculus. They all bring concrete evidence in support to the Pak-Yeliussizov conjecture, according to which a sequence whose both ordinary and exponential generating functions satisfy nonlinear differential equations with polynomial coefficients necessarily satisfies a linear recurrence with polynomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Method For Fast Modular Exponentiation With Factored Modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10497v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast algorithm for modular exponentiation when the factorization of the modulus is known. Let $a,n,m$ be positive integers and suppose $m$ factors canonically as $\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i}$. Choose integer parameters $t_i\in [1, e_i]$ for $1\le i\le k$. Then we can compute the modular exponentiation $a^n\pmod{m}$ in $O(\max(e_i/t_i)+\sum_{i=1}^k t_i\log p_i)$ steps (i.e., modular operations). We go on to analyze this algorithm mathematically and programmatically, showing significant asymptotic improvement in specific cases. Specifically, for an infinite family of $m$ we achieve a complexity of $O(\sqrt{\log m})$ steps, much faster than the Repeated Squaring Algorithm, which has complexity $O(\log m)$. Additionally, we extend our algorithm to matrices and hence general linear recurrences. The complexity is similar; with the same setup we can exponentiate matrices in $GL_d(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})$ in less than $O(\max(e_i/t_i)+d^2\sum_{i=1}^k t_i\log p_i)$ steps. This improves Fiduccia's algorithm and the results of Bostan and Mori in the case of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We prove analogous results for $\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}$ ring extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We help Alice play a certain "convergence game" against Bob and win the prize, which is a constructive solution to a problem by Erd\H{o}s and Graham, posed in their 1980 book on open questions in combinatorial number theory. Namely, after several reductions using peculiar arithmetic identities, the game outcome shows that the set of points \[ \Big(\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+1}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+2}\Big), \] obtained as $A$ ranges over infinite sets of positive integers, has a non-empty interior. This generalizes a two-dimensional result by Erd\H{o}s and Straus.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic solutions to KZ equations, ordinary crystals, and $p^s$-hypergeometric solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the KZ connection associated with a family of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Then the dual connection is the Gauss-Manin connection of that family. We observe that the Gauss-Manin connection has an ordinary $F$-crystal structure and its unit root subcrystal is of rank $g$. We prove that all local flat sections of the KZ connection annihilate the unite root subcrystal, and the space of all local flat sections of the KZ connection is a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module of rank $g$. We also consider the reduction modulo $p^s$ of the unit root subcrystal for any $s\geq 1$. We prove that its annihilator is generated by the so-called $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections of the KZ connection. In particular, that means that the reduction modulo $p^s$ of an arbitrary local flat section of the KZ connection over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a linear combination of the $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections.</description>

      <title>Zeta elements for elliptic curves and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ with conductor $N$ and $p\nmid 2N$ a prime. Let $L$ be an imaginary quadratic field with $p$ split. We prove the existence of $p$-adic zeta element for $E$ over $L$, encoding two different $p$-adic $L$-functions associated to $E$ over $L$ via explicit reciprocity laws at the primes above $p$. We formulate a main conjecture for $E$ over $L$ in terms of the zeta element, mediating different main conjectures in which the $p$-adic $L$-functions appear, and prove some results toward them.
  The zeta element has various applications to the arithmetic of elliptic curves. This includes a proof of main conjecture for semistable elliptic curves $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ at supersingular primes $p$, as conjectured by Kobayashi in 2002. It leads to the $p$-part of the conjectural Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) formula for such curves of analytic rank zero or one, and enables us to present the first infinite families of non-CM elliptic curves for which the BSD conjecture is true. We provide further evidence towards the BSD conjecture: new cases of $p$-converse to the Gross--Zagier and Kolyvagin theorem, and $p$-part of the BSD formula for ordinary primes $p$. Along the way, we give a proof of a conjecture of Perrin-Riou connecting Beilinson--Kato elements with rational points.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the solutions to the Diophantine equations \( F_n = 2^k (2^m - 1) \) and \( F_n = 5^k (5^m - 1) \), where \( F_n \) denotes the Fibonacci numbers defined by the recurrence relation \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \). We demonstrate that the only solutions to the equation \(F_n = 2^k (2^m - 1)\) are \((n, k, m) = \{(3, 1, 1), (6, 3, 1)\}\), while the equation \(F_n = 5^k (5^m - 1)\) has no solutions.</description>

      <title>Dumont-Thomas complement numeration systems for $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the well-known Dumont--Thomas numeration systems to $\mathbb{Z}$ using an approach inspired by the two's complement numeration system. Integers in $\mathbb{Z}$ are canonically represented by a finite word (starting with $\mathtt{0}$ when nonnegative and with $\mathtt{1}$ when negative). The systems are based on two-sided periodic points of substitutions as opposed to the right-sided fixed points. For every periodic point of a substitution, we construct an automaton which returns the letter at position $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ of the periodic point when fed with the representation of $n$ in the corresponding numeration system. The numeration system naturally extends to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We give an equivalent characterization of the numeration system in terms of a total order on a regular language. Lastly, using particular periodic points, we recover the well-known two's complement numeration system and the Fibonacci analogue of the two's complement numeration system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extension of Szemer\'edi's Theorem is proved for sets of positive density in approximate lattices in general locally compact and second countable abelian groups. As a consequence, we establish a recent conjecture of Klick, Strungaru and Tcaciuc. Via a novel version of Furstenberg's Correspondence principle, which should be of independent interest, we show that our Szemer\'edi Theorems can be deduced from a general \emph{transverse} multiple recurrence theorem, which we establish using recent works of Austin.</description>

      <title>Cluster Magnification, Root Capacity, Unique Chains and Base Change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is inspired from the work of M Krithika and P Vanchinathan on Cluster Magnification and the work of Alexander Perlis on Cluster Size. We establish the existence of polynomials for given degree and cluster size over number fields which generalises a result of Perlis. We state the Strong cluster magnification problem and establish an equivalent criterion for that. We also discuss the notion of weak cluster magnification and prove some properties. We provide an important example answering a question about Cluster Towers. We introduce the concept of Root capacity and prove some of its properties. We also introduce the concept of unique descending and ascending chains for extensions and establish some properties and explicitly compute some interesting examples. Finally we establish results about all these phenomena under a particular type of base change. The article concludes with results about strong cluster magnification and unique chains and some properties of the ascending index for a field extension.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic properties of families of plane polynomial automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an algebraic family $f\colon\Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2 \to \Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2$ of plane polynomial automorphisms of H\'enon type parameterized by a quasi-projective curve, defined over a number field $\mathbb{K},$ we investigate certain arithmetic properties of periodic points contained in a family of subvarieties $X \subset \Lambda \times \mathbb{A}^2 \twoheadrightarrow \Lambda$.
  First, consider $X$ as a curve. We prove that the set of parameters $t\in\Lambda(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$, such that $X_t$ is periodic, has bounded height. This generalizes a result of Patrick Ingram. Moreover, if $X$ is non-periodic, then under some mild conditions -- such as when the family is dissipative -- we show that there are, in fact, only finitely many periodic parameters. This extends a result of Charles Favre and Romain Dujardin.
  Second, let $X$ be a family of curves. Assuming $X$ is non-degenerate, we establish a uniform bound on the number of periodic points in each curve $X_t$, $t\in \Lambda(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ and show that the set of these periodic points have bounded height in $\Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2$ as well. We then examine in more detail the non-degeneracy property in the case of dissipative families of quadratic H\'enon maps.</description>

      <title>Condensed Ricci Curvature on Paley Graphs and their Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore properties of generalized Paley graphs and we extend a result of Lim and Praeger by providing a more precise description of the connected components of disconnected generalized Paley graphs. This result leads to a new characterization of when generalized Paley graphs are disconnected. We also provide necessary and sufficient divisibility conditions for the multiplicative group of the prime subfield of certain finite fields to be contained in the multiplicative subgroup of nonzero $k$-th powers. This latter result plays a crucial role in our development of a sorting algorithm on generalized Paley graphs that exploits the vector space structure of finite fields to partition certain subsets of vertices in a manner that decomposes the induced bipartite subgraph between them into complete balanced bipartite subgraphs. As a consequence, we establish a matching condition between these subsets of vertices that results in an explicit formula for the condensed Ricci curvature on certain Paley graphs and their generalizations.</description>
