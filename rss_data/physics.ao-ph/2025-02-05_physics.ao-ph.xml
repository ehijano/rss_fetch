      <title>The 1908 Tunguska Event and Bright Nights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a series of works, devoted to various aspects of the June 30, 1908 Tunguska event. In those days, various sky optical anomalies were observed over a large area. In the presented paper, the main focus is on bright nights. Bright nights are the glow (airglow) of the night sky, visible to the naked eye. In the author's opinion, atmospheric gravitational waves played a large role in their appearance in 1908, as evidenced by the behavior of atmospheric pressure in late June and early July 1908. Some other geophysical peculiarities of that period, which could have affected the appearance of bright nights, and possibly other optical sky anomalies, are also considered.</description>

      <title>Energetically consistent localised APE budgets for local and regional studies of stratified flow energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because it allows a rigorous separation between reversible and irreversible processes, the concept of available potential energy (APE) has become central to the study of turbulent stratified fluids. In ocean modelling, it is fundamental to the parameterisation of meso-scale ocean eddies and of the turbulent mixing of heat and salt. However, how to apply APE theory consistently to local or regional subdomains has been a longstanding source of confusion due to the globally defined Lorenz reference state entering the definition of APE and of buoyancy forces being generally thought to be meaningless in those cases. In practice, this is often remedied by introducing heuristic `localised' forms of APE density depending uniquely on region-specific reference states, possibly diverging significantly from the global Lorenz reference state. In this paper, we argue that this practice is problematic because it cannot consistently describes the turbulent APE cascades associated with the inter-scale energy transfers between the APE produced at large scales -- which depends on the global Lorenz reference state -- and the APE of smaller scales. To avoid this difficulty, we argue that localised forms of APE density should be defined as the eddy APE component of an exact mean/eddy decomposition of the APE density. The eddy APE density thus defined exhibits a much weaker dependency on the global Lorenz reference state than the mean APE, in agreement with physical intuition, but with a different structure than that of existing heuristic localised APE forms. The results are important, because they establish a rigorous physical basis for linking parameterised energy transfers to observable viscous and diffusive dissipation rates, which is a pivotal goal of energetically consistent ocean models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Near Real Time AI-NWP Hurricane Forecasts: Improving Explainability and Performance Through Physics-Based Models and Land Surface Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hurricane track forecasting remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between the atmosphere, land, and ocean. Although AI-based numerical weather prediction models, such as Google Graphcast operation, have significantly improved hurricane track forecasts, they currently function as atmosphere-only models, omitting critical land and ocean interactions. To investigate the impact of land feedback, we conducted independent simulations using the physics-based Hurricane WRF experimental model to assess how soil moisture variations influence storm trajectories. Our results show that land surface conditions significantly alter storm paths, demonstrating the importance of land-atmosphere coupling in hurricane prediction. Although recent advances have introduced AI-based atmosphere-ocean coupled models, a fully functional AI-driven atmosphere-land-ocean model does not yet exist. Our findings suggest that AI-NWP models could be further improved by incorporating land surface interactions, improving both forecast accuracy and explainability. Developing a fully coupled AI-based weather model would mark a critical step toward more reliable and physically consistent hurricane forecasting, with direct applications for disaster preparedness and risk mitigation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and thermodynamic contributions to future extreme-rainfall intensification: a case study for Belgium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme precipitation is projected to become more frequent and more intense due to climate change and associated thermodynamical effects, but the local response of atmospheric circulation under future climate scenarios remains uncertain due mainly to dynamical differences. In this study, we outline a methodology for a regional assessment of future extreme precipitation based on the Lamb Weather Type classification and to evaluate future changes in weather patterns. While anticyclonic days occur most frequently over Belgium, extreme rainfall is mostly associated with days of cyclonic, westerly and south-westerly weather patterns. GCMs from CMIP6 are first selected based on their reliability in representing local atmospheric circulation patterns during days with extreme rainfall days. It was found that for our case study over Belgium, the future (end-of-the-century SSP3-7.0) changes in intensity and likelihood of rainfall extremes can be primarily attributed to thermodynamic factors, with minimal contribution from changes in atmospheric dynamics. Both intensity and probability of extreme rainfall increase for all seasons. While extreme-rainfall probabilities mostly increase in fall and winter, the associated intensity changes are dominated by positive changes in spring and summer. Additionally, the weather patterns that are historically associated with extreme rainfall, disproportionally contribute to these changes, especially to thermodynamic changes. More specifically, robust changes arise from an increased extreme-rainfall occurrence probability in case of cyclonic, south-westerly and westerly circulation types.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometrical optics approach has been used to derive instability criteria for various swirling flows observed in nature and industrial processes. By applying a short-wavelength local analysis to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation when necessary, we account for viscosity and thermal diffusivity effects. The derived criteria are validated for swirling flows modeled by a cylindrical differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria successfully reproduce known results from numerical linear stability analysis and agree with experimental and simulation data. Moreover, they unify and extend several classical instability criteria: the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally-driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling flows, thereby generalizing the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting concentration levels of air pollutants by transfer learning and recurrent neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution (AP) poses a great threat to human health, and people are paying more attention than ever to its prediction. Accurate prediction of AP helps people to plan for their outdoor activities and aids protecting human health. In this paper, long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used to predict the future concentration of air pollutants (APS) in Macau. Additionally, meteorological data and data on the concentration of APS have been utilized. Moreover, in Macau, some air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs) have less observed data in quantity, and, at the same time, some AQMSs recorded less observed data of certain types of APS. Therefore, the transfer learning and pre-trained neural networks have been employed to assist AQMSs with less observed data to build a neural network with high prediction accuracy. The experimental sample covers a period longer than 12-year and includes daily measurements from several APS as well as other more classical meteorological values. Records from five stations, four out of them are AQMSs and the remaining one is an automatic weather station, have been prepared from the aforesaid period and eventually underwent to computational intelligence techniques to build and extract a prediction knowledge-based system. As shown by experimentation, LSTM RNNs initialized with transfer learning methods have higher prediction accuracy; it incurred shorter training time than randomly initialized recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>Shoaling of Finite-Amplitude Rogue Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rogue wave formation and enhancement over coastal areas have been documented over the last decade. However, this recent knowledge is in apparent contradiction with the established observation of sub-Gaussian wave statistics near shallow water. Current theories and experiments describe the rogue wave amplification near shallow water regimes, but only for small-amplitude waves, and thus, not accounting for wave-breaking processes. To address this gap, we perform experiments to probe inhomogeneous wave fields nearing the wave-breaking regime. We also show that by increasing the significant wave height towards the breaking limit, the kinetic energy grows faster than the variance of the surface elevation due to nonlinearity, providing a physical explanation why the occurrence of rogue wave first increases in shallower waters and suddenly decreases further shorewards.</description>
