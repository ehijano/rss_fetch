      <title>Neural Machine Unranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of machine unlearning within neural information retrieval, termed Neural Machine UnRanking (NuMuR) for short. Many of the mainstream task- or model-agnostic approaches for machine unlearning were designed for classification tasks. First, we demonstrate that these methods perform poorly on NuMuR tasks due to the unique challenges posed by neural information retrieval. Then, we develop a methodology for NuMuR named Contrastive and Consistent Loss (CoCoL), which effectively balances the objectives of data forgetting and model performance retention. Experimental results demonstrate that CoCoL facilitates more effective and controllable data removal than existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Topic Detection on Web via Simulating Levy Walks Nature of Topics in Similarity Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizing a few webpages from social media websites into popular topics is one of the key steps to understand trends on web. Discovering popular topics from web faces a sea of noise webpages which never evolve into popular topics. In this paper, we discover that the similarity values between webpages in a popular topic contain the statistically similar features observed in Levy walks. Consequently, we present a simple, novel, yet very powerful Explore-Exploit (EE) approach to group topics by simulating Levy walks nature in the similarity space. The proposed EE-based topic clustering is an effective and effcient method which is a solid move towards handling a sea of noise webpages. Experiments on two public data sets demonstrate that our approach is not only comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness but also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency.</description>

      <title>IntentRec: Predicting User Session Intent with Hierarchical Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems have played a critical role in diverse digital services such as e-commerce, streaming media, social networks, etc. If we know what a user's intent is in a given session (e.g. do they want to watch short videos or a movie or play games; are they shopping for a camping trip), it becomes easier to provide high-quality recommendations. In this paper, we introduce IntentRec, a novel recommendation framework based on hierarchical multi-task neural network architecture that tries to estimate a user's latent intent using their short- and long-term implicit signals as proxies and uses the intent prediction to predict the next item user is likely to engage with. By directly leveraging the intent prediction, we can offer accurate and personalized recommendations to users. Our comprehensive experiments on Netflix user engagement data show that IntentRec outperforms the state-of-the-art next-item and next-intent predictors. We also share several findings and downstream applications of IntentRec.</description>

      <title>HoME: Hierarchy of Multi-Gate Experts for Multi-Task Learning at Kuaishou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the practical problems and the lessons learned at short-video services from Kuaishou. In industry, a widely-used multi-task framework is the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, which always introduces some shared and specific experts for each task and then uses gate networks to measure related experts' contributions. Although the MoE achieves remarkable improvements, we still observe three anomalies that seriously affect model performances in our iteration: (1) Expert Collapse: We found that experts' output distributions are significantly different, and some experts have over 90% zero activations with ReLU, making it hard for gate networks to assign fair weights to balance experts. (2) Expert Degradation: Ideally, the shared-expert aims to provide predictive information for all tasks simultaneously. Nevertheless, we find that some shared-experts are occupied by only one task, which indicates that shared-experts lost their ability but degenerated into some specific-experts. (3) Expert Underfitting: In our services, we have dozens of behavior tasks that need to be predicted, but we find that some data-sparse prediction tasks tend to ignore their specific-experts and assign large weights to shared-experts. The reason might be that the shared-experts can perceive more gradient updates and knowledge from dense tasks, while specific-experts easily fall into underfitting due to their sparse behaviors. Motivated by those observations, we propose HoME to achieve a simple, efficient and balanced MoE system for multi-task learning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Applications of State Space Models and Advanced Training Techniques in Sequential Recommendations: A Comparative Study on Efficiency and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems aim to estimate the dynamically changing user preferences and sequential dependencies between historical user behaviour and metadata. Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.</description>

      <title>A Decoding Acceleration Framework for Industrial Deployable LLM-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, increasing attention has been paid to LLM-based recommender systems, but their deployment is still under exploration in the industry. Most deployments utilize LLMs as feature enhancers, generating augmentation knowledge in the offline stage. However, in recommendation scenarios, involving numerous users and items, even offline generation with LLMs consumes considerable time and resources. This generation inefficiency stems from the autoregressive nature of LLMs, and a promising direction for acceleration is speculative decoding, a Draft-then-Verify paradigm that increases the number of generated tokens per decoding step. In this paper, we first identify that recommendation knowledge generation is suitable for retrieval-based speculative decoding. Then, we discern two characteristics: (1) extensive items and users in RSs bring retrieval inefficiency, and (2) RSs exhibit high diversity tolerance for text generated by LLMs. Based on the above insights, we propose a Decoding Acceleration Framework for LLM-based Recommendation (dubbed DARE), with Customized Retrieval Pool to improve retrieval efficiency and Relaxed Verification to increase the acceptance rate of draft tokens, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARE achieves a 3-5x speedup and is compatible with various frameworks and backbone LLMs. DARE has also been deployed to online advertising scenarios within a large-scale commercial environment, achieving a 3.45x speedup while maintaining the downstream performance.</description>

      <title>Moment&amp;Cross: Next-Generation Real-Time Cross-Domain CTR Prediction for Live-Streaming Recommendation at Kuaishou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kuaishou, is one of the largest short-video and live-streaming platform, compared with short-video recommendations, live-streaming recommendation is more complex because of: (1) temporarily-alive to distribution, (2) user may watch for a long time with feedback delay, (3) content is unpredictable and changes over time. Actually, even if a user is interested in the live-streaming author, it still may be an negative watching (e.g., short-view &lt; 3s) since the real-time content is not attractive enough. Therefore, for live-streaming recommendation, there exists a challenging task: how do we recommend the live-streaming at right moment for users? Additionally, our platform's major exposure content is short short-video, and the amount of exposed short-video is 9x more than exposed live-streaming. Thus users will leave more behaviors on short-videos, which leads to a serious data imbalance problem making the live-streaming data could not fully reflect user interests. In such case, there raises another challenging task: how do we utilize users' short-video behaviors to make live-streaming recommendation better?</description>

      <title>Advancing Re-Ranking with Multimodal Fusion and Target-Oriented Auxiliary Tasks in E-Commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of e-commerce, the effectiveness of search re-ranking models is crucial for enhancing user experience and driving conversion rates. Despite significant advancements in feature representation and model architecture, the integration of multimodal information remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating the computation and fusion of textual and visual information in the context of re-ranking. We propose \textbf{A}dvancing \textbf{R}e-Ranking with \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{m}odal Fusion and \textbf{T}arget-Oriented Auxiliary Tasks (ARMMT), which integrates an attention-based multimodal fusion technique and an auxiliary ranking-aligned task to enhance item representation and improve targeting capabilities. This method not only enriches the understanding of product attributes but also enables more precise and personalized recommendations. Experimental evaluations on JD.com's search platform demonstrate that ARMMT achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal information integration, evidenced by a 0.22\% increase in the Conversion Rate (CVR), significantly contributing to Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). This pioneering approach has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce re-ranking, leading to elevated user satisfaction and business growth.</description>

      <title>GraphTransfer: A Generic Feature Fusion Framework for Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in collaborative filtering tasks due to their ability to extract powerful structural features. However, combining the graph features extracted from user-item interactions and auxiliary features extracted from user genres and item properties remains a challenge. Currently available fusion methods face two major issues: 1) simple methods such as concatenation and summation are generic, but not accurate in capturing feature relationships; 2) task-specific methods like attention mechanisms and meta paths may not be suitable for general feature fusion. To address these challenges, we present GraphTransfer, a simple but universal feature fusion framework for GNN-based collaborative filtering. Our method accurately fuses different types of features by first extracting graph features from the user-item interaction graph and auxiliary features from users and items using GCN. The proposed cross fusion module then effectively bridges the semantic gaps between the interaction scores of different features. Theoretical analysis and experiments on public datasets show that GraphTransfer outperforms other feature fusion methods in CF tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our framework via empirical studies in three other scenarios, showing that GraphTransfer leads to significant improvements in the performance of CF algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimizing RAG Techniques for Automotive Industry PDF Chatbots: A Case Study with Locally Deployed Ollama Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for offline PDF chatbots in automotive industrial production environments, optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in local, low-performance settings has become increasingly important. This study focuses on enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for processing complex automotive industry documents using locally deployed Ollama models. Based on the Langchain framework, we propose a multi-dimensional optimization approach for Ollama's local RAG implementation. Our method addresses key challenges in automotive document processing, including multi-column layouts and technical specifications. We introduce improvements in PDF processing, retrieval mechanisms, and context compression, tailored to the unique characteristics of automotive industry documents. Additionally, we design custom classes supporting embedding pipelines and an agent supporting self-RAG based on LangGraph best practices. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a proprietary dataset comprising typical automotive industry documents, including technical reports and corporate regulations. We compared our optimized RAG model and self-RAG agent against a naive RAG baseline across three datasets: our automotive industry dataset, QReCC, and CoQA. Results demonstrate significant improvements in context precision, context recall, answer relevancy, and faithfulness, with particularly notable performance on the automotive industry dataset. Our optimization scheme provides an effective solution for deploying local RAG systems in the automotive sector, addressing the specific needs of PDF chatbots in industrial production environments. This research has important implications for advancing information processing and intelligent production in the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>The landscape of ontologies in materials science and engineering: A survey and evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontologies are widely used in materials science to describe experiments, processes, material properties, and experimental and computational workflows. Numerous online platforms are available for accessing and sharing ontologies in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE). Additionally, several surveys of these ontologies have been conducted. However, these studies often lack comprehensive analysis and quality control metrics. This paper provides an overview of ontologies used in Materials Science and Engineering to assist domain experts in selecting the most suitable ontology for a given purpose. Sixty selected ontologies are analyzed and compared based on the requirements outlined in this paper. Statistical data on ontology reuse and key metrics are also presented. The evaluation results provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the investigated MSE ontologies. This enables domain experts to select suitable ontologies and to incorporate relevant terms from existing resources.</description>

Abstract: Our study presents a multifaceted approach to enhancing user interaction and content relevance in social media platforms through a federated learning framework. We introduce personalized GPT and Context-based Social Media LLM models, utilizing federated learning for privacy and security. Four client entities receive a base GPT-2 model and locally collected social media data, with federated aggregation ensuring up-to-date model maintenance. Subsequent modules focus on categorizing user posts, computing user persona scores, and identifying relevant posts from friends' lists. A quantifying social engagement approach, coupled with matrix factorization techniques, facilitates personalized content suggestions in real-time. An adaptive feedback loop and readability score algorithm also enhance the quality and relevance of content presented to users. Our system offers a comprehensive solution to content filtering and recommendation, fostering a tailored and engaging social media experience while safeguarding user privacy.</description>

      <title>Document-Level Event Extraction with Definition-Driven ICL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in document-level event extraction tasks, but existing methods face challenges in the design of prompts. To address this issue, we propose an optimization strategy called "Definition-driven Document-level Event Extraction (DDEE)." By adjusting the length of the prompt and enhancing the clarity of heuristics, we have significantly improved the event extraction performance of LLMs. We used data balancing techniques to solve the long-tail effect problem, enhancing the model's generalization ability for event types. At the same time, we refined the prompt to ensure it is both concise and comprehensive, adapting to the sensitivity of LLMs to the style of prompts. In addition, the introduction of structured heuristic methods and strict limiting conditions has improved the precision of event and argument role extraction. These strategies not only solve the prompt engineering problems of LLMs in document-level event extraction but also promote the development of event extraction technology, providing new research perspectives for other tasks in the NLP field.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Large Language Models to Optimize the Detection and Explainability of Phishing Websites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, an open-source, lightweight Large Language Model (LLM) specifically designed for phishing website detection through contextual analysis of the website. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning models that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to new threats and deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our model utilizes the advanced language processing capabilities of LLMs to learn granular features that are characteristic of phishing attacks. Furthermore, PhishLang operates with minimal data preprocessing and offers performance comparable to leading deep learning tools, while being significantly faster and less resource-intensive. Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang successfully identified approximately 26K phishing URLs, many of which were undetected by popular antiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential to aid current detection measures. We also evaluate PhishLang against several realistic adversarial attacks and develop six patches that make it very robust against such threats. Furthermore, we integrate PhishLang with GPT-3.5 Turbo to create \textit{explainable blocklisting} - warnings that provide users with contextual information about different features that led to a website being marked as phishing. Finally, we have open-sourced the PhishLang framework and developed a Chromium-based browser extension and URL scanner website, which implement explainable warnings for end-users.</description>

      <title>Iterative Improvement of an Additively Regularized Topic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic modelling is fundamentally a soft clustering problem (of known objects -- documents, over unknown clusters -- topics). That is, the task is incorrectly posed. In particular, the topic models are unstable and incomplete. All this leads to the fact that the process of finding a good topic model (repeated hyperparameter selection, model training, and topic quality assessment) can be particularly long and labor-intensive. We aim to simplify the process, to make it more deterministic and provable. To this end, we present a method for iterative training of a topic model. The essence of the method is that a series of related topic models are trained so that each subsequent model is at least as good as the previous one, i.e., that it retains all the good topics found earlier. The connection between the models is achieved by additive regularization. The result of this iterative training is the last topic model in the series, which we call the iteratively updated additively regularized topic model (ITAR). Experiments conducted on several collections of natural language texts show that the proposed ITAR model performs better than other popular topic models (LDA, ARTM, BERTopic), its topics are diverse, and its perplexity (ability to "explain" the underlying data) is moderate.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Approximation, Adaptation, and Other Tales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank approximation is a fundamental technique in modern data analysis, widely utilized across various fields such as signal processing, machine learning, and natural language processing. Despite its ubiquity, the mechanics of low-rank approximation and its application in adaptation can sometimes be obscure, leaving practitioners and researchers with questions about its true capabilities and limitations. This paper seeks to clarify low-rank approximation and adaptation by offering a comprehensive guide that reveals their inner workings and explains their utility in a clear and accessible way. Our focus here is to develop a solid intuition for how low-rank approximation and adaptation operate, and why they are so effective. We begin with basic concepts and gradually build up to the mathematical underpinnings, ensuring that readers of all backgrounds can gain a deeper understanding of low-rank approximation and adaptation. We strive to strike a balance between informal explanations and rigorous mathematics, ensuring that both newcomers and experienced experts can benefit from this survey. Additionally, we introduce new low-rank decomposition and adaptation algorithms that have not yet been explored in the field, hoping that future researchers will investigate their potential applicability.</description>

      <title>ConvKGYarn: Spinning Configurable and Scalable Conversational Knowledge Graph QA datasets with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational assistants necessitates dynamic, scalable, and configurable conversational datasets for training and evaluation. These datasets must accommodate diverse user interaction modes, including text and voice, each presenting unique modeling challenges. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured and evolving nature, offer an ideal foundation for current and precise knowledge. Although human-curated KG-based conversational datasets exist, they struggle to keep pace with the rapidly changing user information needs. We present ConvKGYarn, a scalable method for generating up-to-date and configurable conversational KGQA datasets. Qualitative psychometric analyses confirm our method can generate high-quality datasets rivaling a popular conversational KGQA dataset while offering it at scale and covering a wide range of human-interaction configurations. We showcase its utility by testing LLMs on diverse conversations - exploring model behavior on conversational KGQA sets with different configurations grounded in the same KG fact set. Our results highlight the ability of ConvKGYarn to improve KGQA foundations and evaluate parametric knowledge of LLMs, thus offering a robust solution to the constantly evolving landscape of conversational assistants.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Similarity for Measuring Decision-Making Style and Policy Diversity in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defining and measuring decision-making styles, also known as playstyles, is crucial in gaming, where these styles reflect a broad spectrum of individuality and diversity. However, finding a universally applicable measure for these styles poses a challenge. Building on Playstyle Distance, the first unsupervised metric to measure playstyle similarity based on game screens and raw actions, we introduce three enhancements to increase accuracy: multiscale analysis with varied state granularity, a perceptual kernel rooted in psychology, and the utilization of the intersection-over-union method for efficient evaluation. These innovations not only advance measurement precision but also offer insights into human cognition of similarity. Across two racing games and seven Atari games, our techniques significantly improve the precision of zero-shot playstyle classification, achieving an accuracy exceeding 90 percent with fewer than 512 observation-action pairs, which is less than half an episode of these games. Furthermore, our experiments with 2048 and Go demonstrate the potential of discrete playstyle measures in puzzle and board games. We also develop an algorithm for assessing decision-making diversity using these measures. Our findings improve the measurement of end-to-end game analysis and the evolution of artificial intelligence for diverse playstyles.</description>

      <title>Wiping out the limitations of Large Language Models -- A Taxonomy for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current research on RAGs is distributed across various disciplines, and since the technology is evolving very quickly, its unit of analysis is mostly on technological innovations, rather than applications in business contexts. Thus, in this research, we aim to create a taxonomy to conceptualize a comprehensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adoption of this technology in the IS community. To the best of our knowledge, no RAG application taxonomies have been developed so far. We describe our methodology for developing the taxonomy, which includes the criteria for selecting papers, an explanation of our rationale for employing a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. When discussing our findings, we also detail the specific research areas and pose key research questions to guide future information system researchers as they explore the emerging topics of RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Personalized Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We primarily focus on the field of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, which has been actively explored recently and poses a significant challenge in effectively enhancing recommender systems with logical reasoning abilities and open-world knowledge. Current mainstream efforts mainly center around injecting personalized information from recommendation models into LLMs by customizing input templates or aligning representations between semantic and recommendation spaces at the prediction layer. However, they face three significant limitations: (1) LoRA is mostly used as a core component in existing works, but personalization is not well established in LoRA parameters as the LoRA matrix shared by every user may not cater to different users' characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance. (2) Although lifelong personalized behavior sequences are ideal for personalization, their use raises effectiveness and efficiency issues since LLMs require escalating training and inference time to extend text lengths. (3) Existing approaches aren't scalable for large datasets due to training efficiency constraints. Thus, LLMs only see a small fraction of the datasets (e.g., less than 10%) instead of the whole datasets, limiting their exposure to the full training space. To address these problems, we propose RecLoRA. This model incorporates a Personalized LoRA module that maintains independent LoRAs for different users and a Long-Short Modality Retriever that retrieves different history lengths for different modalities, significantly improving performance while adding minimal time cost. Furthermore, we design a Few2Many Learning Strategy, using a conventional recommendation model as a lens to magnify small training spaces to full spaces. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our RecLoRA compared to existing baseline models.</description>

      <title>PK-ICR: Persona-Knowledge Interactive Context Retrieval for Grounded Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06674v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying relevant persona or knowledge for conversational systems is critical to grounded dialogue response generation. However, each grounding has been mostly researched in isolation with more practical multi-context dialogue tasks introduced in recent works. We define Persona and Knowledge Dual Context Identification as the task to identify persona and knowledge jointly for a given dialogue, which could be of elevated importance in complex multi-context dialogue settings. We develop a novel grounding retrieval method that utilizes all contexts of dialogue simultaneously. Our method requires less computational power via utilizing neural QA retrieval models. We further introduce our novel null-positive rank test which measures ranking performance on semantically dissimilar samples (i.e. hard negatives) in relation to data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Protecting Copyrighted Material with Unique Identifiers in Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major public concern regarding the training of large language models (LLMs) is whether they abusing copyrighted online text. Previous membership inference methods may be misled by similar examples in vast amounts of training data. Additionally, these methods are often too complex for general users to understand and use, making them centralized, lacking transparency, and trustworthiness. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detection} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their own identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{ghost sentences}, a primitive form of unique identifiers, consisting primarily of passphrases made up of random words. By embedding one ghost sentences in a few copyrighted texts, users can detect its membership using a perplexity test and a \textit{user-friendly} last-$k$ words test. The perplexity test is based on the fact that LLMs trained on natural language should exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. As the repetition increases, users can leverage the verbatim memorization ability of LLMs to perform a last-$k$ words test by chatting with LLMs without writing any code. Both tests offer rigorous statistical guarantees for membership inference. For LLaMA-13B, a perplexity test on 30 ghost sentences with an average of 7 repetitions in 148K examples yields a 0.891 ROC AUC. For the last-$k$ words test with OpenLLaMA-3B, 11 out of 16 users, with an average of 24 examples each, successfully identify their data from 1.8M examples.</description>
