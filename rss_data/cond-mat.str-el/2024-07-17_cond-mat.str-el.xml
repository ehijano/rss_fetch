      <title>Electron phonon coupling in the topological heavy fermion model of twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene serve as the arena where exotic correlation physics unfolds. Previous studies have shown that phonons, through mediating an effective electron-electron interaction, can play a crucial role in determining various electronic phases. In this study, we project the full electron-phonon coupling vertex, derived from microscopic tight-binding lattice calculations, onto the basis of the topological heavy fermion model [Song and Bernevig, PRL 129, 047601 (2022)], and identify the significance of each phonon mode. With phonon fields integrated out, an on-site anti-Hund's interaction $\hat{H}_{\rm A}$ on the moir\'e-scale local $f$-orbitals is obtained, with strengths 1 to 4 meV. We solve the phonon-induced multiplet splittings, and then elaborate on phonon-favored symmetry-breaking orders at even-integer fillings. Through systematic self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we uncover a tight competition between $\Gamma$-phonon-favored orbital orders, $K$-phonon-favored inter-valley coherent orders, and the kinetic and Coulomb-favored orders. A Hund's interaction $\hat{H}_{\rm H}$ with strengths 1 to 3 meV, which originates from the carbon atom Hubbard, and partly counteracts the effect of $\hat{H}_{\rm A}$, is also discussed. In the end, we explore the possibility of finding an exotic Dirac semi-metal at the charge-neutrality point which is formed solely by $c$-electrons, while $f$-impurities exhibit a symmetric Mott gap by forming non-degenerate singlets under $\hat{H}_{\rm A,H}$. Experimental features that distinguish such a state are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement scaling and area-law charge fluctuations in a non-Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu{=}1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic example of a non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter precisely different from a Fermi liquid? The entanglement entropy of the CFL state was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analogue [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu{=}1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional continuum system. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second R\'enyi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu{=}1/2$ but also at $\nu{=}1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu{=}1$ and $\nu{=}1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in the CFL state.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous orbital selective Mott phase in the two band Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials featuring both itinerant and localized degrees of freedom exhibit numerous exotic phases and transitions that deviate from the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm. This work uses the composite operator formalism to examine two-orbital strongly correlated Hubbard models. We observe the spontaneous breaking of orbital symmetry, where the electron density in one of the orbitals reaches half-filling, resulting in an orbitally selective Mott phase (OSMP). This broken symmetry phase becomes unstable at a critical average electronic density away from half-filling. Furthermore, significant orbital differentiation persists up to a moderate inter-orbital hopping, beyond which the system abruptly transitions to an orbitally uniform phase. In the OSMP phase, the electrons in the two orbitals are weakly hybridized, resulting in a small Fermi surface. The volume of the Fermi surface jumps at the transition from the OSMP to the orbitally uniform phase. We also discuss the physical mechanisms leading to the collapse of the OSMP phase under different perturbations.</description>

      <title>Ising-type quantum spin liquid state in PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have grown single crystals of PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, an ideal triangular-lattice antiferromagnet, and performed magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements at low temperatures. The main results are as follows: (i) The temperature-dependent susceptibility shows a negligible in-plane response and the isothermal magnetization curves confirm the easy axis along the $c$ axis. (ii) The specific heat measurements reveal the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 60 mK, and the power-law temperature dependence indicates the existence of the gapless magnetic excitations in system. (iii) The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity exhibits negligibly small residual term ($\kappa_0/T$) and strong spin-phonon scattering effect, suggesting that the spin excitations are also involved. Our results further demonstrate that PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ is a rare quantum spin liquid candidate with Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Magnetic skin effect in Pb(Fe$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxor-ferroelectrics display exceptional dielectric properties resulting from the underlying random dipolar fields induced by strong chemical inhomogeneity. An unusual structural aspect of relaxors is a skin-effect where the near-surface region in single crystals exhibit structures and critical phenomena that differ from the bulk. Relaxors are unique in that this skin effect extends over a macroscopic lengthscale of $\sim$ 100$\mu$m whereas usual surface layers only extend over a few unit cells (or $\sim$ nm). We present a muon spectroscopy study of Pb(Fe$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_{3}$ (PFN) which displays ferroelectric order, including many relaxor-like dielectric properties such as a frequency broadened dielectric response, and antiferromagnetism with spatially short-range polar correlations and hence can be termed a multiferroic. In terms of the magnetic behavior determined by the Fe$^{3+}$ ($S=5/2$, $L\approx0$) ions, PFN has been characterized as a unique example of a "cluster spin-glass". We use variable momentum muon spectroscopy to study the depth dependence of the slow magnetic relaxations in a large 1 cm$^{3}$ crystal of PFN. Zero-field positive muon spin relaxation is parameterized using a stretched exponential, indicative of a distribution of relaxation rates of the Fe$^{3+}$ spins. This bandwidth of frequencies changes as a function of muon momentum, indicative of a change in the Fe$^{3+}$ relaxation rates as a function of muon implantation depth in our single crystal. Using negative muon elemental analysis, we find small-to-no measurable change in the Fe$^{3+}$/Nb$^{5+}$ concentration with depth implying that chemical concentration alone cannot account for the change in the relaxational dynamics. PFN displays an analogous magnetic skin effect reported to exist in the structural properties of relaxor-ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenstates with off-diagonal long-range order for interacting bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermions and hardcore bosons share the same restriction: no more than one particle can occupy a single site in a lattice system. Specifically, in one dimension, two systems can share the same matrix representation. In this work, we investigate both the fermion and hardcore-boson models with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction in a ring lattice. We construct the exact eigenstates of the hardcore-boson model with resonant NN interaction and show that they possess off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. In comparison, the fermionic counterpart does not support such a feature due to the different particle statistics, although they share an identical energy spectrum. In addition, we examine the effect of the periodic boundary condition on the dynamics of the condensate states through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic pseudogap in the two-dimensional Hubbard model deep in the renormalized classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-wavelength spin fluctuations prohibit antiferromagnetic long-range order at finite temperature in two dimensions. Nevertheless, the correlation length starts to grow rapidly at a crossover temperature, leading to critical slowing down and to a renormalized-classical regime over a wide range of temperature, between a fraction of the mean-field transition temperature and the zero-temperature ordered state. This leads to a single-particle pseudogap of the kind observed in electron-doped cuprates. Very few theoretical methods can claim an accurate description of this regime. The challenge is that in this regime Fermi-liquid quasiparticles are already destroyed and new quasiparticles of the ordered state are not fully formed yet. Here, we study this problem for the two-dimensional Hubbard model by first generalizing the two-particle self-consistent approach. Using a special algorithm, spin fluctuations are treated in the thermodynamic limit even for large correlation lengths. The effects of Kanamori-Br\"uckner screening, of classical and of quantum fluctuations are taken into account. Results are presented at half-filling for the one-band Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping. They agree well with available benchmark diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo at high temperature where the pseudogap opens up. In addition to temperature-dependent spectral properties, we find quantum corrections to the zero-temperature renormalized mean-field antiferromagnetic gap. Finally, analytic continuation of the Matsubara results for spectral functions show that the pseudogap opens up at significantly higher temperature than was previously identified based on the Matsubara data only.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetism and tricriticalilty in heavy-fermion ferromagnet URhGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: URhGe is a ferromagnetic superconductor with a distinctive magnetic behavior. In a field applied parallel to the b-axis and perpendicular to the easy axis, URhGe exhibits an abrupt orientational transition of the magnetization with a reentrant superconducting phase emerging close to the transition field. We develop a theoretical description of the magnetic properties of URhGe by considering a spin model with competing magnetic anisotropies. The model is analyzed both analytically at zero temperature and with Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperatures. The constructed H-T phase diagram for a magnetic field parallel to the b-axis features a tricritical point on the line of phase transitions between the ferromagnetic Ising state and the paramagnetic phase. We also demonstrate that the asymptotic tricritical behavior of the order parameter and the correlation length is described by the mean-field critical exponents.</description>

Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos in Liouville CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast scrambling is a distinctive feature of quantum gravity, which by means of holography is closely tied to the behaviour of large$-c$ conformal field theories. We study this phenomenon in the context of semiclassical Liouville theory, providing both insights into the mechanism of scrambling in CFTs and into the structure of Liouville theory, finding that it exhibits a maximal Lyapunov exponent despite not featuring the identity in its spectrum. However, as we show, the states contributing to the relevant correlation function can be thought of as dressed scramblons. At a technical level we we first use the path integral picture in order to derive the Euclidean four-point function in an explicit compact form. Next, we demonstrate its equivalence to a conformal block expansion, revealing an explicit but non-local map between path integral saddles and conformal blocks. By analytically continuing both expressions to Lorentzian times, we obtain two equivalent formulations of the OTOC, which we use to study the onset of chaos in Liouville theory. We take advantage of the compact form in order to extract a Lyapunov exponent and a scrambling time. From the conformal block expansion formulation of the OTOC we learn that scrambling shifts the dominance of conformal blocks from heavy primaries at early times to the lightest primary at late times. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent surge of research in many-body quantum entanglement has uncovered intriguing properties of quantum many-body systems. A prime example is the modular commutator, which can extract a topological invariant from a single wave function. Here, we unveil novel geometric properties of many-body entanglement via a modular commutator of two-dimensional gapped quantum many-body systems. We obtain the geometric additivity of a modular commutator, indicating that modular commutator for a multipartite system may be an integer multiple of the one for tripartite systems. Using our additivity formula, we also derive a curious identity for the modular commutators involving disconnected intervals in a certain class of conformal field theories. We further illustrate this geometric additivity for both bulk and edge subsystems using numerical calculations of the Haldane and $\pi$-flux models.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid behavior of non-altermagnetic RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presence of magnetism in potentially altermagnetic RuO$_2$ has been a subject of intense debate. Using broadband infrared spectroscopy combined with density-functional band-structure calculations, we show that optical conductivity of RuO$_2$, the bulk probe of its electronic structure, is well described by the nonmagnetic model of this material. The sharp Pauli edge demonstrates the presence of a Dirac nodal line lying 45 meV below the Fermi level. Good match between the experimental and ab initio plasma frequencies underpins weakness of electronic correlations. The intraband part of the optical conductivity indicates Fermi-liquid behavior with two distinct scattering rates below 150 K. Fermi-liquid theory also accounts for the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of RuO$_2$ and allows a consistent description of this material as paramagnetic metal.</description>

Abstract: We describe the problems of quantum chemistry, the intuition behind classical heuristic methods used to solve them, a conjectured form of the classical complexity of quantum chemistry problems, and the subsequent opportunities for quantum advantage. This article is written for both quantum chemists and quantum information theorists. In particular, we attempt to summarize the domain of quantum chemistry problems as well as the chemical intuition that is applied to solve them within concrete statements (such as a classical heuristic cost conjecture and a classification of different avenues for quantum advantage) in the hope that this may stimulate future analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transition and Thermal Equilibrium in the Lattice Thirring Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases, and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as non-analyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Whereas the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Majorana Clifford Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study the analogous objects for systems of Majorana fermions. A crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system in which the fundamental degrees of freedom are fermionic. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving fermionic Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>DMRG study of the theta-dependent mass spectrum in the 2-flavor Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the massive $2$-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism using the density-matrix renormalization group(DMRG). The masses of the composite particles, the pion and sigma meson, are computed by two independent methods. One is the improved one-point-function scheme, where we measure the local meson operator coupled to the boundary state and extract the mass from its exponential decay. Since the $\theta$ term causes a nontrivial operator mixing, we unravel it by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to define the meson operator. The other is the dispersion-relation scheme, a heuristic approach specific to Hamiltonian formalism. We obtain the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states. The sign problem is circumvented in these methods, and their results agree with each other even for large $\theta$. We reveal that the $\theta$-dependence of the pion mass at $m/g=0.1$ is consistent with the prediction by the bosonized model. We also find that the mass of the sigma meson satisfies the semi-classical formula, $M_{\sigma}/M_{\pi}=\sqrt{3}$, for almost all region of $\theta$. While the sigma meson is a stable particle thanks to this relation, the eta meson is no longer protected by the $G$-parity and becomes unstable for $\theta\neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Dissipationless topological quantum computation for Majorana objects in sparse-dense mixed encoding process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation based on Majorana objects is subject to a significant challenge because at least some of the two-qubit quantum gates rely on the fermion (either charge or spin) parity of the qubits. This dependency renders the quantum operations involving these gates probabilistic when attempting to advance quantum processes within the quantum circuit model. Such an approach leads to significant information loss whenever measurements yield the undesired fermion parity. To resolve the problem of wasting information, we devise topological operations that allow for the non-dissipative correction of information from undesired fermion parity to the desired one. We will use the sparse-dense mixed encoding process for the controlled-NOT gate as an example to explain how corrections can be implemented without affecting the quantum information carried by the computational qubits. This correction process can be applied {to} either the undesired input qubits or the fermion parity-dependent quantum gates, and it works for both Majorana-zero-mode-based and Majorana-edge-mode-based topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and operator correlation signatures of many-body quantum Zeno phases in inefficiently monitored noisy systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between information-scrambling Hamiltonians and local continuous measurements hosts platforms for exotic measurement-induced phase transition in out-of-equilibrium steady states. Here, we consider such transitions under the addition of local random white noise and measurement inefficiency in a XX spin chain. We identify a non-monotonic dependence on the local noise strength in both the averaged entanglement and operator correlations, specifically the subsystem parity variance. While the non-monotonicity persists at any finite efficiency for the operator correlations, it disappears at finite inefficiency for the entanglement. The analysis of scaling with the system size in a finite length chain indicates that, at finite efficiency, this effect leads to distinct MiPTs for operator correlations and entanglement. Our result hints at a difference between area-law entanglement scaling and Zeno-localized phases for inefficient monitoring.</description>

      <title>Simple Fermionic backflow states via a systematically improvable tensor decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective ansatz for the wave function of correlated electrons that brings closer the fields of machine learning parameterizations and tensor rank decompositions. We consider a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization of a general backflow transformation in second quantization for a simple, compact and systematically improvable Fermionic state. This directly encodes $N$-body correlations without the ordering dependence of other tensor decompositions. We consider and explicitly demonstrate various controllable truncations, in the rank and range of the backflow correlations or magnitude of local energy contributions, in order to systematically affect scaling reductions to $\mathcal{O}[N^{3-4}]$. Benchmarking against small Fermi-Hubbard and chemical systems reveals an improvement over other NQS-like models, while extending towards larger strongly correlated ab initio systems demonstrates competitive accuracy with more established DMRG techniques on ab initio 2D hydrogenic lattices with realistic long-range Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States for Classical and Quantum Simulation of Gauge Theories at Finite Temperature and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature and density is a longstanding challenge in nuclear and high-energy physics that also has fundamental implications for condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the utility of minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) approaches to facilitate both classical and quantum computational studies of such systems. METTS techniques combine classical random sampling with imaginary time evolution, which can be performed on either a classical or a quantum computer, to estimate thermal averages of observables. We study the simplest model of a confining gauge theory, namely $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to spinless fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions, which can be directly mapped to a local quantum spin chain with two- and three-body interactions. We benchmark both a classical matrix-product-state implementation of METTS and a recently proposed adaptive variational approach to METTS that is a promising candidate for implementation on near-term quantum devices, focusing on the equation of state as well as on various measures of fermion confinement. Of particular importance is the choice of basis for obtaining new METTS samples, which impacts both the classical sampling complexity (a key factor in both classical and quantum simulation applications) and complexity of circuits used in the quantum computing approach. Our work sets the stage for future studies of strongly coupled gauge theories with both classical and quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonintegrable many-body quantum systems typically thermalize at long times through the mechanism of quantum chaos. However, some exceptional systems, such as those harboring quantum scars, break thermalization, serving as testbeds for foundational problems of quantum statistical physics. Here, we investigate a class of nonintegrable bond-staggered models that is endowed with a large number of zero-energy eigenstates and possesses a non-Abelian internal symmetry. We use character theory to give a lower bound on the zero-energy degeneracy, which matches exact diagonalization results, and is found to grow exponentially with the system size. We also show that few-magnon zero-energy states have an exact analytical description, allowing us to build a basis of low-entangled fixed-separation states, which is stable to most perturbations found in experiments. This remarkable dynamical stability of special states elucidates our understanding of nonequilibrium processes in non-Abelian chaotic quantum models.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</description>

Abstract: We report an isothermal electric field-induced first-order phase transition from Mott-insulator to the metallic state in the epitaxial thin film of V$_2$O$_3$ in the temperature regime below its Mott transition temperature $\approx$ 180 K. This isothermal electric field induced transition is accompanied by interesting electro-thermal history effects, which depend on the measurement paths followed in the electric field - temperature phase space. These interesting properties result in tuneable resistive switching and distinct memristive behavior in V$_2$O$_3$. A generalized framework of disorder-influenced first-order phase transition in combination with a resistor network model has been used to explain the observed experimental features. These findings promise possibilities for Mott insulators to be highly energy-efficient switches in novel technologies like neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the finite size scaling behavior of the R\'enyi entanglement entropy (EE) of several representative 2d quantum many-body systems between a subregion and its complement, with smooth boundaries as well as boundaries with corners. In order to reveal the subleading correction, we investigate the quantity ``subtracted EE" $S^s(l) = S(2l) - 2S(l)$ for each model, which is designed to cancel out the leading perimeter law. We find that $\mathbf{(1)}$ for a spin-1/2 model on a 2d square lattice whose ground state is the Neel order, the coefficient of the logarithmic correction to the perimeter law is consistent with the prediction based on the Goldstone modes; $\mathbf{(2)}$ for the $(2+1)d$ O(3) Wilson-Fisher quantum critical point (QCP), realized with the bilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, a logarithmic subleading correction exists when there is sharp corner of the subregion, but for subregion with a smooth boundary our data suggests the absence of the logarithmic correction to the best of our efforts; $\mathbf{(3)}$ for the $(2+1)d$ SU(2) J-Q$_2$ and J-Q$_3$ model for the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), we find a logarithmic correction for the EE even with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>Photodriven Mott insulating heterostructures: A steady-state study of impact ionization processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the photocurrent and spectral features in a simplified model of a Mott photovoltaic system consisting of a multilayered insulating heterostructure. The central correlated region is coupled to two metallic leads kept at different chemical potentials. A periodic drive applied to the correlated region produces excited doublons and holons across the Mott gap which are then separated by a potential gradient, which mimics the polarization-induced electric field present in oxyde heterostructures. The nonequilibrium Floquet steady-state is addressed by means of dynamical mean-field theory and its Floquet extension, while the so-called auxiliary master equation approach is employed as impurity solver. We find that impact ionization, identified by a kink in the photocurrent as function of the driving frequency, becomes significant and is generally favoured by weak, narrow-band hybridizations to the leads beyond a certain strength of the driving field. On the other hand, in the case of a direct coupling to metallic leads with a flat band, we observe a drastic reduction of impact ionization and of the photocurrent itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in attosecond core-level spectroscopies have successfully unlocked the fastest dynamics involving high-energy electrons. Yet, these techniques are not conventionally regarded as an appropriate probe for low-energy quasiparticle interactions that govern the ground state of quantum materials, nor for studying long-range order because of their limited sensitivity to local charge environments. Here, by employing a unique cryogenic attosecond beamline, we identified clear core-level signatures of long-range charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in a quasi-2D excitonic insulator candidate, even though equilibrium photoemission and absorption measurements of the same core levels showed no spectroscopic singularity at the phase transition. Leveraging the high time resolution and intrinsic sensitivity to short-range charge excitations in attosecond core-level absorption, we observed compelling time-domain evidence for excitonic correlations in the normal-state of the material, whose presence has been subjected to a long-standing debate in equilibrium experiments because of interfering phonon fluctuations in a similar part of the phase space. Our findings support the scenario that short-range excitonic fluctuations prelude long-range order formation in the ground state, providing important insights in the mechanism of exciton condensation in a quasi-low-dimensional system. These results further demonstrate the importance of a simultaneous access to long- and short-range order with underlying dynamical processes spanning a multitude of time- and energy-scales, making attosecond spectroscopy an indispensable tool for both understanding the equilibrium phase diagram and for discovering novel, nonequilibrium states in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of near-term digital quantum computers could offer us an exciting opportunity to investigate quantum many-body phenomena beyond that of classical computing. To make the best use of the hardware available, it is paramount that we have methods that accurately simulate Hamiltonian dynamics for limited circuit depths. In this paper, we propose a method to classically optimise unitary brickwall circuits to approximate quantum time evolution operators. Our method is scalable in system size through the use of tensor networks. We demonstrate that, for various three-body Hamiltonians, our approach produces quantum circuits that can outperform Trotterization in both their accuracy and the quantum circuit depth needed to implement the dynamics, with the exact details being dependent on the Hamiltonian. We also explain how to choose an optimal time step that minimises the combined errors of the quantum device and the brickwall circuit approximation.</description>

      <title>Massless Lifshitz Field Theory for Arbitrary $z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the notion of fractional derivatives, we introduce a class of massless Lifshitz scalar field theory in (1+1)-dimension with an arbitrary anisotropy index $z$. The Lifshitz scale invariant ground state of the theory is constructed explicitly and takes the form of Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK). We show that there is a continuous family of ground states with degeneracy parameterized by the choice of solution to the equation of motion of an auxiliary classical system. The quantum mechanical path integral establishes a 2d/1d correspondence with the equal time correlation functions of the Lifshitz scalar field theory. We study the entanglement properties of the Lifshitz theory for arbitrary $z$ using the path integral representation. The entanglement measures are expressed in terms of certain cross ratio functions we specify, and satisfy the $c$-function monotonicity theorems. We also consider the holographic description of the Lifshitz theory. In order to match with the field theory result for the entanglement entropy, we propose a $z$-dependent radius scale for the Lifshitz background. This relation is consistent with the $z$-dependent scaling symmetry respected by the Lifshitz vacuum. Furthermore, the time-like entanglement entropy is determined using holography. Our result suggests that there should exist a fundamental definition of time-like entanglement other than employing analytic continuation as performed in relativistic field theory.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum and field-induced pairings in orbital-singlet spin-triplet superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-momentum pairing in a Pauli-limited spin-singlet superconductor arises from the pair-breaking effects of an external Zeeman field, a mechanism which is not applicable in odd-parity spin-triplet superconductors. However, in multiorbital systems, the relevant bands originating from different orbitals are usually separated in momentum space, implying that orbital-singlet pairing is a natural candidate for a finite-momentum pairing state. We show that finite-momentum pairing arises in even-parity orbital-singlet spin-triplet superconductors via the combination of orbitally-nontrivial kinetic terms and Hund's coupling. The finite-momentum pairing is then suppressed with an increasing spin-orbit coupling, stabilizing a uniform pseudospin-singlet pairing. We also examine the effects of the magnetic field and find field-induced superconductivity at large fields. We apply these findings to the multiorbital superconductor with spin-orbit coupling, Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ and show that a finite-momentum pseudospin-singlet state appears between the uniform pairing and normal states. Future directions of inquiry relating to our findings are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior around the fixed points driven by fermion-fermion interactions and disorders in the nodal-line superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the intricate interplay between short-range fermion-fermion interactions and disorder scatterings beneath the superconducting dome of noncentrosymmetric nodal-line superconductors. Employing the renormalization group that unbiasedly treats all kinds of potential degrees of freedom, we establish energy-dependent coupled flows for all associated interaction parameters. Decoding the low-energy information from these coupled evolutions leads to the emergence of several intriguing behavior in the low-energy regime. At first, we identify eight distinct types of fixed points, which are determined by the competition of all interaction parameters and dictate the low-energy properties. Next, we carefully examine and unveil distinct fates of physical implications as approaching such fixed points. The density of states of quasiparticles displays a linear dependence on frequency around the first fixed point, while other fixed points present diverse frequency-dependent behavior. Compressibility and specific heat exhibit unique trends around different fixed points, with the emergence of non-Fermi-liquid behavior nearby the fifth fixed point. Furthermore, after evaluating the susceptibilities of the potential states, we find that a certain phase transition below the critical temperature can be induced when the system approaches the fifth fixed point, transitioning from the nodal-line superconducting state to another superconducting state. This research would enhance our understanding of the unique behavior in the low-energy regime of nodal-line superconductors.</description>

      <title>Direct current generation by dielectric loss in ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study direct current (DC) generation induced by microwave irradiation to ferroelectric materials. The DC generation originates from microwave absorption called dielectric loss due to the delay of dielectric response. Such current generation can be formulated as the low-frequency limit of the phonon shift current which arises from an increase of electric polarization accompanying photoexcitation of phonons due to the electron-phonon coupling. To study the DC generation by the dielectric loss, we apply the diagrammatic treatment of nonlinear optical responses to photoexcitations of phonons and derive the general formula for phonon shift current. We then study the DC generation in the low-frequency region and find that the current scales as $\propto \omega^2$ for the linearly polarized light and time reversal symmetric systems. We estimate the order of magnitude of the DC generation by dielectric loss, indicating its feasibility for experimental detection in the GHz region.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics, anomaly inflow and bosonic effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euler hydrodynamics of perfect fluids can be viewed as an effective bosonic field theory. In cases when the underlying microscopic system involves Dirac fermions, the quantum anomalies should be properly described. In 1+1 dimensions the action formulation of hydrodynamics at zero temperature is reconsidered and shown to be equal to standard field-theory bosonization. Furthermore, it can be derived from a topological gauge theory in one extra dimension, which identifies the fluid variables through the anomaly inflow relations. Extending this framework to 3+1 dimensions yields an effective field theory/hydrodynamics model, capable of elucidating the mixed axial-vector and axial-gravitational anomalies of Dirac fermions. This formulation provides a platform for bosonization in higher dimensions. Moreover, the connection with 4+1 dimensional topological theories suggests some generalizations of fluid dynamics involving additional degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Effects of forward disorder on quasi-1D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between disorder and singlet superconductivity in a quasi-1d system. We investigate the applicability of the Anderson theorem, namely that time-reversal conserving (non-magnetic) disorder does not impact the critical temperature, by opposition to time-reversal breaking disorder (magnetic). To do so we examine a quasi-1d system of spin 1/2 fermions with attractive interactions and forward scattering disorder using field theory (bosonization). By computing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), we find that for non-magnetic disorder the Anderson theorem also holds in the quasi-1D geometry. On the contrary, magnetic disorder has an impact on the critical temperature, that we investigate by deriving renormalization group (RG) equations describing the competition between the disorder and the interactions. Computing the critical temperature as a function of disorder strength, we see that different regimes arise depending on the strength of interactions. We discuss possible platforms where to observe this in cold atoms and condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness versus entanglement in matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between entanglement and non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) in matrix product states (MPSs). We study the relation between magic and the bond dimension used to approximate the ground state of a many-body system in two different contexts: full state of magic and mutual magic (the non-stabilizer analogue of mutual information, thus free of boundary effects) of spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg chains. Our results indicate that obtaining converged results for non-stabilizerness is typically considerably easier than entanglement. For full state magic at critical points and at sufficiently large volumes, we observe convergence with $1/\chi^2$, with $\chi$ being the MPS bond dimension. At small volumes, magic saturation is so quick that, within error bars, we cannot appreciate any finite-$\chi$ correction. Mutual magic also shows a fast convergence with bond dimension, whose specific functional form is however hindered by sampling errors. As a by-product of our study, we show how Pauli-Markov chains (originally formulated to evaluate magic) resets the state of the art in terms of computing mutual information for MPS. We illustrate this last fact by verifying the logarithmic increase of mutual information between connected partitions at critical points. By comparing mutual information and mutual magic, we observe that, for connected partitions, the latter is typically scaling much slower - if at all - with the partition size, while for disconnected partitions, both are constant in size.</description>

      <title>Intricate magnetic landscape in antiferromagnetic kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and interplay with Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (Ln: Tb-Lu) shurikagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present the discovery and characterization of the kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ in tandem with a new series of compounds, the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (Ln: Tb-Lu) shurikagome metals. We previously reported on the growth of the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ (Ln: La-Gd$^{3+}$, Eu$^{2+}$, Yb$^{2+}$) family, a chemically diverse and exfoliable series of kagome metals with complex and highly anisotropic magnetism. However, unlike the La-Gd analogs, TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ cannot be synthesized by our previous methodology due to phase competition with Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (x$\sim$1.7-1.2). Here we discuss the phase competition between the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ families, helping to frame the difficulty in synthesizing LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ compounds with small Ln species and providing a strategy to circumvent formation of Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$. Detailed characterization of the magnetic and electronic transport properties on single crystals of TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ reveals a highly complex landscape of magnetic phases arising from an antiferromagnetic ground state. A series of metamagnetic transitions creates at least 5 unique magnetic phase pockets, including a 1/3 and 2/3 magnetization plateau. Further, the system exhibits an intimate connection between the magnetism and magnetotransport, exhibiting sharp switching from positive (+40%) to negative magnetoresistance (-50%). Like the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ kagome metals, the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ family exhibits quasi-2D networks of titanium and chains of rare-earth. We present the structures and some basic magnetic properties of the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ family alongside our characterization of the newly discovered TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$.</description>

      <title>Impurities with a cusp: general theory and 3d Ising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In CFTs, the partition function of a line defect with a cusp depends logarithmically on the size of the line with an angle-dependent coefficient: the cusp anomalous dimension. In the first part of this work, we study the general properties of the cusp anomalous dimension. We relate the small cusp angle limit to the effective field theory of defect fusion, making predictions for the first couple of terms in the expansion. Using a concavity property of the cusp anomalous dimension we argue that the Casimir energy between a line defect and its orientation reversal is always negative ("opposites attract"). We use these results to determine the fusion algebra of Wilson lines in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM as well as pinning field defects in the Wilson-Fisher fixed points. In the second part of the paper we obtain nonperturbative numerical results for the cusp anomalous dimension of pinning field defects in the Ising model in $d=3$, using the recently developed fuzzy-sphere regularization. We also compute the pinning field cusp anomalous dimension in the $O(N)$ model at one-loop in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. Our results are in agreement with the general theory developed in the first part of the work, and we make several predictions for impurities in magnets.</description>

      <title>Representing Arbitrary Ground States of Toric Code by Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>
