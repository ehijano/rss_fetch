      <title>Translating Workflow Nets into the Partially Ordered Workflow Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) has recently emerged as a process modeling notation, offering strong quality guarantees and high expressiveness. However, its adoption is hindered by the prevalence of standard notations like workflow nets (WF-nets) and BPMN in practice. This paper presents a novel algorithm for transforming safe and sound WF-net into equivalent POWL models. The algorithm recursively identifies structural patterns within the WF-net and translates them into their POWL representation. We formally prove the correctness of our approach, showing that the generated POWL model preserves the language of the input WF-net. Furthermore, we demonstrate the high scalability of our algorithm, and we show its completeness on a subclass of WF-nets that encompasses equivalent representations for all POWL models. This work bridges the gap between the theoretical advantages of POWL and the practical need for compatibility with established notations, paving the way for broader adoption of POWL in process analysis and improvement applications.</description>

      <title>Zippy -- Generic White-Box Proof Search with Zippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for tree-based proof search, called Zippy. Unlike existing proof search tools, Zippy is largely independent of concrete search tree representations, search-algorithms, states and effects. It is designed to create analysable and navigable proof searches that are open to customisation and extensions by users. Zippy is founded on concepts from functional programming theory, particularly zippers, arrows, monads, and lenses. We implemented the framework in Isabelle's metaprogramming language Isabelle/ML.</description>

      <title>Automated Reasoning in Blockchain: Foundations, Applications, and Frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative paradigm for decentralized and secure data management across diverse application domains, including healthcare, supply chain management, and the Internet of Things. Its core features, such as decentralization, immutability, and auditability, achieved through distributed consensus algorithms and cryptographic techniques, offer significant advantages for multi-stakeholder applications requiring transparency and trust. However, the inherent complexity and security-critical nature of blockchain systems necessitate rigorous analysis and verification to ensure their correctness, reliability, and resilience against potential vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Propositional inclusion atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inclusion atoms are standard dependencies used in database theory and dependence logic. We give an alternative completeness proof for the axiomatization of inclusion atoms with and without restrictions on repeated variables. The alternative proof implies completeness of the systems for inclusion atoms not only in the first-order setting but also in the propositional setting, previously not covered by the literature. The result is extended to propositional inclusion atoms with Boolean constants, introducing a complete axiomatization and showing that no such axiomatization can be k-ary. We also show that the decision problems for the inclusion atoms considered are, like inclusion atoms without repeated variables, PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Four imprints of Belnap's useful four-valued logic in computer science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review four areas of theoretical computer science which share technical or philosophical ideas with the work of Belnap on his useful four-valued logic. Perhaps surprisingly, the inspiration by Belnap-Dunn logic is acknowledged only in the study of d-frames. The connections of Belnap's work and linear logic, Blame Calculus or the study of LVars are not openly admitted.
  The key to three of these connections with Belnap's work go via the twist-product representation of bilattices. On the one hand, it allows us to view a large class of models of linear logic as based on Belnap-Dunn logic. On the other hand, d-frames admit two twist-product representation theorems and, also, the key theorem of Blame Calculus is essentially a twist-product representation theorem too, albeit with a strong proof-theoretic flavour.</description>

      <title>Fractal Boundaries of Constructivity: A Meta-Theoretical Critique of Countability and Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All constructive methods employed in modern mathematics produce only countable sets, even when designed to transcend countability. We show that any constructive argument for uncountability -- excluding diagonalization techniques -- effectively generates only countable fragments within a closed formal system. We formalize this limitation as the "fractal boundary of constructivity", the asymptotic limit of all constructive extensions under syntactically enumerable rules. A central theorem establishes the impossibility of fully capturing the structure of the continuum within any such system. We further introduce the concept of "fractal countability", a process-relative refinement of countability based on layered constructive closure. This provides a framework for analyzing definability beyond classical recursion without invoking uncountable totalities. We interpret the continuum not as an object constructively realizable, but as a horizon of formal expressibility.</description>

      <title>Factorised Representations of Join Queries: Tight Bounds and a New Dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common theme in factorised databases and knowledge compilation is the representation of solution sets in a useful yet succinct data structure. In this paper, we study the representation of the result of join queries (or, equivalently, the set of homomorphisms between two relational structures). We focus on the very general format of $\{\cup, \times\}$-circuits -- also known as d-representations or DNNF circuits -- and aim to find the limits of this approach.
  In prior work, it has been shown that there always exists a $\{\cup, \times\}$-circuits-circuit of size $N^{O(subw)}$ representing the query result, where N is the size of the database and subw the submodular width of the query. If the arity of all relations is bounded by a constant, then subw is linear in the treewidth tw of the query. In this setting, the authors of this paper proved a lower bound of $N^{\Omega(tw^{\varepsilon})}$ on the circuit size (ICALP 2023), where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ depends on the excluded grid theorem.
  Our first main contribution is to improve this lower bound to $N^{\Omega(tw)}$, which is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent. Our second contribution is a $N^{\Omega(subw^{1/4})}$ lower bound on the circuit size for join queries over relations of unbounded arity. Both lower bounds are unconditional lower bounds on the circuit size for well-chosen database instances. Their proofs use a combination of structural (hyper)graph theory with communication complexity in a simple yet novel way. While the second lower bound is asymptotically equivalent to Marx's conditional bound on the decision complexity (JACM 2013), our $N^{\Theta(tw)}$ bound in the bounded-arity setting is tight, while the best conditional bound on the decision complexity is $N^{\Omega(tw/\log tw)}$. Note that, removing this logarithmic factor in the decision setting is a major open problem.</description>

      <title>Linear-Time Graph Programs without Preconditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a recent breakthrough in rule-based graph programming, which allows us to reach the time complexity of imperative linear-time algorithms. In general, achieving the complexity of graph algorithms in conventional languages using graph transformation rules is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be executed in linear time using the graph programming language GP 2. However, for non-destructive algorithms that retain the structure of input graphs, achieving linear runtime required input graphs to be connected and of bounded node degree. In this paper, we overcome these preconditions by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies, a cycle detection program, a program for numbering the connected components of a graph, and a breadth-first search program. Each of these programs runs in linear time on both connected and disconnected input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. We give empirical evidence for the linear time complexity by using timings for various classes of input graphs.</description>

      <title>Semiring Provenance for Lightweight Description Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate semiring provenance--a successful framework originally defined in the relational database setting--for description logics. In this context, the ontology axioms are annotated with elements of a commutative semiring and these annotations are propagated to the ontology consequences in a way that reflects how they are derived. We define a provenance semantics for a language that encompasses several lightweight description logics and show its relationships with semantics that have been defined for ontologies annotated with a specific kind of annotation (such as fuzzy degrees). We show that under some restrictions on the semiring, the semantics satisfies desirable properties (such as extending the semiring provenance defined for databases). We then focus on the well-known why-provenance, for which we study the complexity of problems related to the provenance of an assertion or a conjunctive query answer. Finally, we consider two more restricted cases which correspond to the so-called positive Boolean provenance and lineage in the database setting. For these cases, we exhibit relationships with well-known notions related to explanations in description logics and complete our complexity analysis. As a side contribution, we provide conditions on an $\mathcal{ELHI}_\bot$ ontology that guarantee tractable reasoning.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Bialgebraic Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositionality proofs in higher-order languages are notoriously involved, and general semantic frameworks guaranteeing compositionality are hard to come by. In particular, Turi and Plotkin's bialgebraic abstract GSOS framework, which provides off-the-shelf compositionality results for first-order languages, so far does not apply to higher-order languages. In the present work, we develop a theory of abstract GSOS specifications for higher-order languages, in effect transferring the core principles of Turi and Plotkin's framework to a higher-order setting. In our theory, the operational semantics of higher-order languages is represented by certain dinatural transformations that we term \emph{(pointed) higher-order GSOS laws}. We give a general compositionality result that applies to all systems specified in this way and discuss how compositionality of combinatory logics and the $\lambda$-calculus w.r.t.\ a strong variant of Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity are obtained as instances.</description>
