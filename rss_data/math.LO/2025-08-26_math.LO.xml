      <title>A Variant Of Chaitin's Omega function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the continuous function $f$ defined by $$x\mapsto \sum_{\sigma\le_L x }2^{-K(\sigma)}$$ as a variant of Chaitin's Omega from the perspective of analysis, computability, and algorithmic randomness. Among other results, we obtain that: (i) $f$ is differentiable precisely at density random points; (ii) $f(x)$ is $x$-random if and only if $x$ is weakly low for $K$ (low for $\Omega$); (iii) the range of $f$ is a null, nowhere dense, perfect $\Pi^0_1(\emptyset')$ class with Hausdorff dimension $1$; (iv) $f(x)\oplus x\ge_T\emptyset'$ for all $x$; (v) there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ many $x$ such that $f(x)$ is not 1-random; (vi) $f$ is not Turing invariant but is Turing invariant on the ideal of $K$-trivial reals. We also discuss the connection between $f$ and other variants of Omega.</description>

      <title>Decidability of some complicated structures definable in $\mathbb{C}(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several properly countable unions of algebraic sets in $\mathbb{C}^n$ are definable in $\mathbb{C}(t)$ including the set CM of $j$-invariants of complex elliptic curves with complex multiplication. It has been suggested that one could prove the undecidability of $\operatorname{Th}(\mathbb{C}(t))$ by showing that the theory of the structure $\mathsf{CM} := (\mathbb{C},+,\cdot,0,1,CM)$ of the field of complex numbers considered with a unary predicate picking out CM is undecidable. We show using an effective version of the Andr\'e-Oort conjecture that to the contrary $\operatorname{Th}(\mathsf{CM})$ is stable and decidable. We discuss some related structures on the complex numbers definable in $\mathbb{C}(t)$ and how their theories may be connected to the Zilber-Pink conjectures.</description>

      <title>New inner models from second order logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new inner model C2(omega) based on the fragment of second order logic in which second order variables range over countable subsets of the domain. We compare C2(omega) to the previously studied inner model C(aa). We argue that C2(omega) appears to be a much bigger inner model than C(aa), although this cannot be literally true in ZFC alone. However, we conjecture that it follows from large cardinal assumptions. For example, assuming large cardinals, C2(omega) contains, for every n, an inner model with n Woodin cardinals, while C(aa) contains, under the same assumption, no inner model with a Woodin cardinal. As to large cardinals in C2(omega), we show that, assuming a Woodin limit of Woodin cardinals, the cardinal omega_1 of V is Mahlo in C2(omega). A stronger result is proved for the combination C2(omega, aa) of C(aa) and C2(omega). We also show that the question whether HOD1, a variant of HOD, is the same as HOD cannot be decided on the basis of ZFC even if we add the assumption that there are supercompact cardinals.</description>

      <title>Complexity in finitary argumentation (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be useful.</description>

      <title>Model Theory of General von Neumann Algebras I: Generalized Ocneanu Ultraproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper collates, presents, and expands upon technology and results obtained as part of the author's PhD thesis. We generalize work done in the $\sigma$-finite setting by the author, Goldbring, Hart, and Sinclair by producing a language and axiomatization of full left Hilbert algebras. To improve the accessibility of using this axiomatization, we examine the metric structure ultraproduct associated to this axiomatization. In doing so, we generalize results of Ando-Haagerup and Masuda-Tomatsu. This examination leads us to multiple operator-algebraic characterizations of the ultraproduct which closely resemble known characterizations of the Ocneanu ultraproduct. One of these is closely related to the notion of continuous elements of an ultraproduct with respect to an action. In the spirit of results of the author, Goldbring, and Hart, we prove various undecidable universal theory results for von Neumann algebras with unbounded weights. Notably, we prove that the hyperfinite II$_\infty$ factor together with its canonical tracial weight has an undecidable theory. This result was expected by experts, but could not be made precise until now. We also study the strengthenings of the negative solution to CEP that this result implies.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Legal Intelligence System Architecture: A Comprehensive Framework for Automated Legal Consultation and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Legal Intelligence and Client Engagement System (LICES), a novel architecture designed to redefine legal consultation services through the systematic integration of advanced artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and federated legal databases. The proposed system uniquely harmonizes the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models with authoritative legal information repositories, including CanLII, LexisNexis, WestLaw, the Justice Laws Website, and Supreme Court records. The architecture employs a multi-layered design that encompasses a dynamic client interface, a robust legal processing server, and an AI-driven knowledge integration layer. Crucially, the system embeds stringent, multi-stage conflict-of-interest protocols and automated compliance checks to ensure adherence to professional ethics. Through detailed system modeling and architectural design, we demonstrate how the integration of speech recognition, document analysis, and a dynamic interview process has the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy and accessibility of legal services. Performance evaluations indicate that the LICES architecture can reduce preliminary legal research and case assessment time by more than 90% compared to traditional paralegal benchmarks while achieving more than 98% of accuracy in citation and legal issue identification This research contributes a scalable, secure, and ethically grounded framework for automated legal services, offering a validated blueprint for navigating multi-jurisdictional complexities and the fragmented landscape of legal data.</description>

Abstract: Skew braces are one of the main algebraic tools controlling the structure of a non-degenerate bijective set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation.

      <title>Enhanced Drift-Aware Computer Vision Architecture for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However, challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>On the packing dimension of unions and extensions of $k$-planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the packing dimension of unions of subsets of $k$-planes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ using tools from algorithmic information theory, obtaining an analog of a result of H\'era and a mild generalization of a recent result of Fraser. Along the way, we introduce a notion of effective dimension on the Grassmannian and affine Grassmannian, and we establish several useful algorithmic and geometric tools in this setting. Additionally, we consider how the packing dimension of the union of certain subsets of $k$-planes changes when the subsets are extended to the entire $k$-plane. Finally, we improve the above bounds for unions and extensions in the special case that $k=n-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Dieter Spreen's notion of a representation associated to a numbered basis equipped with a strong inclusion relation. We show that by relaxing his requirements, we obtain different classically considered representations as subcases, including representations considered by Grubba, Weihrauch and Schr\"oder. We show that the use of an appropriate strong inclusion relation guarantees that the representation associated to a computable metric space seen as a topological space always coincides with the Cauchy representation. We also show how the use of a formal inclusion relation guarantees that when defining multi-representations on a set and on one of its subsets, the obtained multi-representations will be compatible, i.e. inclusion will be a computable map. The proposed definitions are also more robust under change of equivalent bases.</description>

      <title>Invariant uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard results in descriptive set theory provide sufficient conditions for a Borel set $P \subseteq \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$ to admit a Borel uniformization, namely, when $P$ has "small" sections or "large" sections. We consider an invariant analogue of these results: Given a Borel equivalence relation $E$ and an $E$-invariant Borel set $P$ with "small" or "large" sections, does $P$ admit an $E$-invariant Borel uniformization?
  For a given Borel equivalence relation $E$, we show that every $E$-invariant Borel set $P$ with "small" or "large" sections admits an $E$-invariant Borel uniformization if and only if $E$ is smooth. We also compute the definable complexity of counterexamples in the case where $E$ is not smooth, using category, measure, and Ramsey-theoretic methods.
  We provide two new proofs of a dichotomy of Miller classifying the pairs $(E, P)$ such that $P$ admits an $E$-invariant uniformization, for a Borel equivalence relation $E$ and a Borel $E$-invariant set $P$ with countable sections. In the process, we prove an $\aleph_0$-dimensional $(\mathbb{G}_0, \mathbb{H}_0)$ dichotomy, generalizing dichotomies of Miller and Lecomte. We also show that the set of pairs $(E, P)$ such that $P$ has "large" sections and admits an $E$-invariant Borel uniformization is $\boldsymbol{\Sigma^1_2}$-complete; in particular, there is no analog of Miller's dichotomy for $P$ with "large" sections.
  Finally, we consider a less strict notion of invariant uniformization, where we select a countable nonempty subset of each section instead of a single point.</description>

      <title>Effective Reducibility for Statements of Arbitrary Quantifier Complexity with Ordinal Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is an extended version of our work in \cite{Ca2025}. We extend the concept of effective reducibility between statements of set theory with ordinal Turing machines (OTMs) explored in \cite{Ca2018} for $\Pi_{2}$-statements to statements of arbitrary quantifier complexity in prenex normal form and use this to compare various fundamental set-theoretical principles, including the power set axiom, the separation scheme, the collection scheme and the replacement scheme and various principles related to the notion of cardinality, with respect to effective reducibility. This notion of reducibility is both different from (i.e., strictly weaker than) classical truth and from the OTM-realizability of the corresponding implications. Along the way, we obtain a computational characterization of HOD as the class of sets that are OTM-computable relative to every effectivizer of $\Sigma_{2}$-separation. We also consider an associated variant or Weihrauch reducibility.</description>
