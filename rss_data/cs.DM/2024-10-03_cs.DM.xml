      <title>Iterated Radical Expansions and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We treat three recurrences involving square roots, the first of which arises from an infinite simple radical expansion for the Golden mean, whose precise convergence rate was made famous by Richard Bruce Paris in 1987. A never-before-seen proof of an important formula is given. The other recurrences are non-exponential yet equally interesting. Asymptotic series developed for each of these two examples feature a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>

      <title>Additive word complexity and Walnut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, a classical topic of study is the number of specific patterns appearing in infinite sequences. For instance, many works have been dedicated to studying the so-called factor complexity of infinite sequences, which gives the number of different factors (contiguous subblocks of their symbols), as well as abelian complexity, which counts factors up to a permutation of letters. In this paper, we consider the relatively unexplored concept of additive complexity, which counts the number of factors up to additive equivalence. We say that two words are additively equivalent if they have the same length and the total weight of their letters is equal. Our contribution is to expand the general knowledge of additive complexity from a theoretical point of view and consider various famous examples. We show a particular case of an analog of the long-standing conjecture on the regularity of the abelian complexity of an automatic sequence. In particular, we use the formalism of logic, and the software Walnut, to decide related properties of automatic sequences. We compare the behaviors of additive and abelian complexities, and we also consider the notion of abelian and additive powers. Along the way, we present some open questions and conjectures for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit counterexample to the Bunkbed Conjecture introduced by Kasteleyn in 1985. The counterexample is given by a planar graph on $7222$ vertices, and is built on the recent work of Hollom (2024).</description>

      <title>When is local search both effective and efficient?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems define fitness landscapes that combine the numerics of the 'fitness' function to be maximized with the combinatorics of which assignments are adjacent. Local search starts at an initial assignment in this landscape and successively moves to assignments until no further improvement is possible among the adjacent assignments. Classic analyses of local search algorithms have focused mostly on the question of effectiveness ("did the algorithm find a good solution?") and often implicitly assumed that there are no doubts about their efficiency ("did the algorithm find the solution quickly?"). But there are many reasons to doubt the efficiency of local search. Many local search algorithms are known to be inefficient even if we focus on fitness landscapes on the hypercube that are single peaked on every subcube (known as semismooth fitness landscapes, completely unimodal pseudo-Boolean functions, or acyclic unique sink orientations). Here, we want to identify the most expressive subclass of single-peaked binary Boolean valued constraint satisfaction problems for which many popular local search algorithms are efficient. In this paper, we introduce the class of conditionally-smooth fitness landscapes where the preferred assignment of a variable xj depends only on the assignments of variables xi with i less than j in an associated partial order. We prove that many popular local search algorithms like random ascent, simulated annealing, various jumping rules, and the Kernighan-Lin heuristic are very efficient on conditionally-smooth landscapes. Some other popular local search algorithms like steepest ascent and random facet, however, still require a super-polynomial number of steps on these landscapes. Our hope is to contribute to a fuller understanding of what properties fitness landscapes must have for local search algorithms to be both effective and efficient.</description>

      <title>Fractional list packing for layered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional list packing number $\chi_{\ell}^{\bullet}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a graph invariant that has recently arisen from the study of disjoint list-colourings. It measures how large the lists of a list-assignment $L:V(G)\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ need to be to ensure the existence of a `perfectly balanced' probability distribution on proper $L$-colourings, i.e., such that at every vertex $v$, every colour appears with equal probability $1/|L(v)|$. In this work we give various bounds on $\chi_{\ell}^{\bullet}(G)$, which admit strengthenings for correspondence and local-degree versions. As a corollary, we improve theorems on the related notion of flexible list colouring. In particular we study Cartesian products and $d$-degenerate graphs, and we prove that $\chi_{\ell}^{\bullet}(G)$ is bounded from above by the pathwidth of $G$ plus one. The correspondence analogue of the latter is false for treewidth instead of pathwidth.</description>

      <title>Parameterised distance to local irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is \emph{locally irregular} if no two of its adjacent vertices have the same degree. In [Fioravantes et al. Complexity of finding maximum locally irregular induced subgraph. {\it SWAT}, 2022], the authors introduced and studied the problem of finding a locally irregular induced subgraph of a given a graph $G$ of maximum order, or, equivalently, computing a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ of minimum order, whose deletion from $G$ results in a locally irregular graph; $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal vertex-irregulator of $G$}. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of the parameterised complexity of computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a given graph $G$. Moreover, we introduce and study a variation of this problem, where $S$ is a substet of the edges of $G$; in this case, $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal edge-irregulator of $G$}. In particular, we prove that computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a graph $G$ is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity, neighborhood diversity or cluster deletion number of $G$, while it is $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the feedback vertex set number or the treedepth of $G$. In the case of computing an optimal edge-irregulator of a graph $G$, we prove that this problem is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity of $G$, while it is NP-hard even if $G$ is a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $4$, and $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the size of the solution, the feedback vertex set or the treedepth of $G$. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of the tractability of both problems studied here, considering most of the standard graph-structural parameters.</description>
