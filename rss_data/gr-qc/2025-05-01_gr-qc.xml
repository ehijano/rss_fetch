      <title>The frozen vanilla model: Exploring dark sector interactions with delta effective theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new interacting mechanism within the dark sector, encompassing both dark energy and dark matter, while grounding our analysis in the familiar framework of the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ model augmented by baryons and radiation components, including photons and neutrinos. The interaction between dark energy and dark matter is confined to the perturbative level. One significant advantage of this proposal is that all geometric probes yield constraints consistent with the so-called vanilla model or the extended vanilla model, where dark energy has a constant equation of state, $w_{x}$. However, the introduction of this new interacting mechanism affects several theoretical signatures, involving contrast dark matter and dark energy densities. We perform an exploratory analysis of those effects in the CMB power spectra, matter-power spectra, and redshift space distortions. For instance, it allows for a decrease/increment in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect depending on the value taken by the interaction coupling. This effect could be observationally detected by looking for a cross-correlation between the ISW temperature fluctuations and the distribution of galaxies or quasars. At late times, the interaction in the dark sector becomes very effective, affecting the non-linear scale of structure formation. We discuss how the estimators $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ and $S_{8}(z)$ are affected by different interacting couplings; indicating that $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ can show a relative change of up to $15\%$ compared to the concordance model at low redshifts. Finally, we show how the various terms in the dark energy pressure perturbation (both adiabatic and non-adiabatic) are relevant for different scales, demonstrating the absence of large-scale instabilities.</description>

      <title>Big-Bang nucleosynthesis constraints on (dual) Kaniadakis cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of Kaniadakis entropy and its dual formulation, examining their implications for gravitational dynamics within the framework where gravity emerges as an entropic force resulting from changes in the informational content of a physical system. In this context, we derive a modified form of Newton's law of gravitation that reflects the corrections introduced by both Kaniadakis entropy and its dual state. Furthermore, we apply the emergent gravity scenario at large scales and derive the modified Friedmann equations incorporating corrections from (dual) Kaniadakis entropy. Our results provide deeper insights into the interplay between thermodynamics and gravitational dynamics. In order to constrain the model parameter, we study the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis in the context of (dual) Kaniadakis cosmology. We explore an alternative method to establish limits on the Kaniadakis parameter, denoted as $K$, by examining how (dual) Kaniadakis cosmology influences the primordial abundances of light elements. Our analysis indicates that the obtained ranges for the dual Kaniadakis parameter (unlike the Kaniadakis parameter) exhibit overlap for the aforementioned light elements, and the allowed values fall within the range $ -8.00 \times 10^{-75}\lesssim \tilde {K^*}\lesssim 8.00 \times 10^{-75}$, which shows that the deviations from the conventional Bekenstein-Hawking formula are minimal, as expected. This consistency between the ranges suggests a potential solution to the well-known \textit{Lithium problem}.</description>

      <title>An improved parametrized test of general relativity using the IMRPhenomX waveform family: Including higher harmonics and precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When testing general relativity (GR) with gravitational wave observations, parametrized tests of deviations from the expected strong-field source dynamics are one of the most widely used techniques. We present an updated version of the parametrized framework with the state-of-art IMRPhenomX waveform family. Our new framework incorporates deviations in the dominant mode as well as in the higher-order modes of the waveform. We demonstrate that the missing physics of either higher-order modes or precession in the parametrized model can lead to a biased conclusion of false deviation from GR. Our new implementation mitigates this issue and enables us to perform the tests for highly asymmetric and precessing binaries without being subject to systematic biases due to missing physics. Finally, we apply the improved test to analyze events observed during the second half of the third observing run of LIGO and Virgo (O3b). We provide constraints on GR deviations by combining O3b results with those from previous observation runs. Our findings show no evidence for violations of GR.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Topological Aspects of Quadrupoles of Disclinations: Conformal Metrics and Self-Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric and physical effects of quadrupolar configurations of disclinations using a conformal metric approach in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Two cases are considered: a linear quadrupole, inducing anisotropic curvature with a $\cos(2\theta)$ as profile, and a square quadrupole, yielding a more isotropic field with higher angular harmonics. We solve the Poisson equation for the conformal factor and compute the corresponding Green functions. Using these configurations, we evaluated the electrostatic and magnetostatic self-energies and self-forces for linear sources. The results reveal how symmetry and curvature influence self-interaction effects, with the magnetostatic self-force exhibiting a sign reversal compared to the electrostatic case. Connections with previous models of dislocations and cosmic strings are discussed, with potential applications in graphene, nematics, and gravitational analogs.</description>

      <title>The gravito-optic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves have predominantly been detected using interferometric techniques, with standard approaches limited to 10 kHz and with modern advancements extending this bound to 300 kHz. To explore the largely uncharted higher-frequency gravitational wave spectrum, a general wave optics formalism is presented here, revealing a space-time-periodic correction to the electromagnetic wave equation, along with the emergence of sidebands at characteristic angles in the presence of an incident gravitational wave (analogous to acousto-optic diffraction). Then a Fabry-P\'erot-enhanced heterodyne detection scheme is proposed to amplify and measure this effect. It is demonstrated that such a detection strategy has the potential of extending gravitational wave detection to high-frequency regimes far beyond the LIGO sensitivity band. This novel approach provides a pathway to probing new physics through high-frequency gravitational waves in the MHz-GHz range.</description>

      <title>Search for black hole super-radiance using gravito-optic hetrodyne detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy plays a crucial role in early universe cosmology, dark matter detection, and black-hole merger studies. It is shown here that the heterodyne detection of the gravito-optic effect (employing an enhanced Fabry-P\'erot cavity) presents a novel broad band approach to gravitational wave detection, with favorable length and frequency scalings. It is demonstrated that such a device is well suited for detecting gravitational waves generated by the annihilation of bosons around black holes, enabling the exploration of a mass range from \( 2.40 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{eV} \) to \( 4.54 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{eV} \). Furthermore, due to the unique coherent nature of gravitational waves generated by boson annihilation any coherent gravitational waves detected above \( 1.23 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{Hz} \) may be indicative of the existence of black holes of primordial origin.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic expansion through small anisotropies in a Bose-Einstein condensate analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, it is shown that by measuring quantities like density variance in the present state of an analogue universe one can assess information about its history due to the mere existence of small anisotropies in earlier times, here modeled by non-uniform densities. This offers a valuable tool to probe and compare cosmic expansion models and, as an application, it is shown that quantum fluctuations can have a significant impact on the observable universe depending on its history.</description>

      <title>Searching beyond the fiducial stochastic gravitational wave background in pulsar timing array data using likelihood reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the recent announcements of evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background from several pulsar timing array collaborations, much effort has been devoted to explore features beyond the fiducial Hellings-Downs background including those arising in modified gravity theories and deterministic gravitational wave signals. Inspired by previous studies, we propose a method to efficiently screen these models using likelihood reweighting based on the fiducial model. In order to alleviate the well-known unstable weight estimates in vanilla importance sampling, we implement reweighting for the second time making use of the kernel density estimation of the previously reweighted samples. We tested this method by analyzing three simulated datasets with an injected sinusoid signal applied to all pulsars. It is found that likelihood reweighting not only gives results compatible with those from full Bayesian analyses when the signal is subdominant, but is also able to recover the signal posterior to a reasonable accuracy in the presence of a rather strong signal. Given samples from the fiducial model, this method could bring an at least $\mathcal{O}(10)$-time speedup in analyzing new models.</description>

      <title>Linear perturbations of dyonic black holes in the lowest-order $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear perturbations on top of the static and spherically symmetric background of dyonic black hole solutions endowed with electric and magnetic charges, as well as a scalar hair, in the lowest-order $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories. The presence of magnetic charges in the background solutions gives rise to a mixing between the odd-parity and even-parity sectors of perturbations, which makes it impossible to analyze each sector separately. Thus, we expand the action up to second order in both odd-parity and even-parity perturbations and derive the general conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities. We apply these general conditions to extended Einstein-Maxwell theories, which encompass a wide variety of concrete models from the literature known to have dyonic black hole solutions with the scalar hair, and examine their stabilities. Our general framework for studying stability conditions and dynamics of perturbations can be applied to a wide variety of theories, including nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to a scalar field, as well as to calculations of black hole quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Towards model-independent identification of lensed gravitational waves using Kramers-Kronig relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of microlensed gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are essential for studying the mass density distribution in the universe, including black holes and dark matter halos. However, no confident detection of microlensed GWs have been reported to date. There are two important challenges in the identification of microlensed GWs. The first is that the source waveform and lens structure models are not known a-priori. The second is that certain classes of unlensed GWs could mimic microlensed GWs, resulting in undesirable false alarms. In this work, we propose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems. We argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying causality, where KK relation must hold. The power of this method lies in the fact that microlensed GWs, regardless of the lens structure, must obey KK relation, while unlensed GW events are not in general expected to obey it. This, in principle, allows us to identify microlensed GWs while dismissing microlensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a methodology that exploits KK relation, and test its usefulness under idealized conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Non-metricity and Matter Source on the Geometry of Anisotropic Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the impact of extended symmetric teleparallel theory on anisotropic compact stellar structures. The explicit field equations were formulated by considering a minimum model of this extended gravity. Basically, the Darmois junction conditions are used to determine the unknown constants of metric coefficients. We explore some significant properties of the compact stars under consideration to check their viable existence in this modified framework. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation assess the equilibrium state of the compact stars. Moreover, the stability analysis is defined by using methods based on sound speed (related to how disturbances propagate in the star) and adiabatic index (related to the thermodynamic behavior of the star). We find that the proposed compact stars in the $f(\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{T})$ gravity are physically viable and stable.</description>

      <title>Scalar quasinormal modes, Lyapunov exponents and radii of null geodesics of rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasinormal modes of massless scalar field in rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular black holes are studied. The fundamental quasinormal modes and $n=1$ first overtone quasinormal modes are calculated with two numerical methods, i.e. WKB method and matrix method. Impacts of model parameters on the quasinormal modes are also discussed. It is found that the quasinormal modes in rotating Hayward black hole have just percent-level increase compared with that in the Kerr black hole case due to the deviation parameter $g$, while there is ten-percent-level increase for the quasinormal modes in the rotating Bardeen black hole due to $g_*$. It is also found that the monotonicity of fundamental and $n=1$ quasinormal modes in the rotating Bardeen black hole is different. The corotating and counterrotating Lyapunov exponents of the equatorial null circular geodesics in the two rotating black holes are also calculated. Then, the connection between the imaginary parts and real parts of the eikonal quasinormal modes, particularly the first overtone ones, and the properties of the null geodesics in the two rotating regular black holes are explicitly verified.</description>

      <title>Baryon asymmetry from higher-order matter contributions in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter by incorporating higher-order matter contributions in gravity, specifically analyzing gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $ f(R,\mathcal{T}^2) $ gravity, where $ R $ is the Ricci scalar and $ \mathcal{T}^2 \equiv T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu} $. We further explore the impact of high-order matter contributions by considering an interaction term analogous to those in gravitational and spontaneous baryogenesis, constructed using $ \mathcal{T}^2 $. The cutoff energy scale of the new interaction term is presented and its implications to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) are discussed. The properties and implications of this term are analyzed within the frameworks of General Relativity and $f(R, \mathcal{T}^2)$ gravity. Furthermore, a connection to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is established, providing an observational constraint on the functional form of $f(R, \mathcal{T}^2)$. By introducing $\mathcal{T}^2$ into the gravitational action, we propose that these modifications could significantly influence the early Universe's dynamics, thereby altering the conditions necessary for baryogenesis to occur.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal entanglement of the vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the future and left Rindler wedges of Minkowski spacetime are entangled, leading to the Unruh effect. Similarly, the past and right Rindler wedges are also entangled. We propose a protocol to extract this entanglement using two two-state detectors located in the past and right Rindler wedges. By scaling the detector transition frequencies inversely with Minkowski time, entanglement from the quantum field is transferred to the detectors, suggesting they may support quantum teleportation via the vacuum. Our protocol can be implemented with current quantum systems, such as flux-tunable transmon qubits. This research provides new insights into the entanglement properties of spacetime and hints at practical applications for secure quantum information transfer using the vacuum state of a quantum field.</description>

      <title>Test particle motion around a black hole dressed with a spherically symmetric stationary fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of a massive particle around a spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by a stationary and radial inflow of perfect fluid. The background spacetime is modelled as a spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein field equations, where the effect of the fluid on the geometry is treated as a perturbation on the Schwarzschild background. The equation of state for the fluid is assumed to follow the linear relationship $p = w \rho$, where $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the energy density with $w$ being a constant. The stress-energy tensor is treated as a phenomenological model to capture deviations from the vacuum Einstein theory. We allow the parameter $w$ of the equation of state to take both positive and negative values accepting a broad range of scenarios including exotic ones. Specifically, we examine the cases $w =2/3$, $1/3$, $-3/4$ and $-4/3$. For $\rho\geq0$, the former two cases satisfy all standard energy conditions while the case of $w=-3/4$ violates the strong energy condition and the case of $w=-4/3$ violates all standard energy conditions. By solving the geodesic equations, we visualize the time-like geodesics around the black hole, focusing on the apsis shift of the orbit. To gain further insight into the effects of accretion, we employ the method of osculating orbital elements. Additionally, we analyze the observable effects on spacetime by studying the redshift of the orbiting test particles as an example of possible observables. We show that the difference in the particle orbits due to the matter accretion may be probed by using the redshift observation of stars orbiting around the black hole.</description>

      <title>A generic dynamical system formulation for Bianchi-I cosmology with isotropic fluid in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present for the first time a generic dynamical system formulation for Bianchi-I cosmology with an isotropic fluid in $f(Q)$ gravity theory. This generalizes the earlier works in the literature on the Bianchi-I dynamical system in $f(Q)$ gravity that started with writing the Bianchi-I cosmological field equations specific to a chosen $f(Q)$ form and then constructing suitable dimensionless variables. Instead, we start from the generic Bianchi-I cosmological field equations in $f(Q)$ and present a prescription of how one can construct an autonomous dynamical system in terms of the standard Hubble-normalized dimensionless dynamical variables once an $f(Q)$ theory is provided. We discuss its application in late-time and early time cosmology. In the context of late-time cosmology, we implement our formulation in four examples, computing and analyzing the critical points, determining their existence conditions, examining their stability, and plotting the phase portraits to illustrate their behavior. Particular care has been taken to single out the physically viable regions in the phase space for each model. Our findings indicate that the quadratic model is not suitable for studying the late-time anisotropic scenarios, while the other three models yield the same evolution as in GR without providing insights into the cosmological evolution of anisotropic critical points. In the early time cosmology scenario, the isotropization dynamics in vacuum is model independent; inflating cosmology always isotropizes, whereas a contracting cosmology is always unstable, making it impossible to obtain a classically stable nonsingular bouncing solution.</description>

      <title>Modification of Newtonian Gravity: Implications for Hot Gas in Clusters and Galactic Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the negative results from various dark matter detection experiments, we had earlier proposed an alternate theoretical framework through Modification of Newtonian Gravity (MONG). Here, the Poison's equation is modified by introducing an additional gravitational self-energy density term along with the usual dark energy density term. In this work we extend this model to account for the presence of low-density gas at high temperatures (10^8 K) in the intra cluster medium (ICM) by estimating the velocities to which particles will be subjected by the modified gravitational force. Considering that the ICM is under the influence of the cluster's gravity, particle velocities of the ions in the ICM must be balanced by the cluster's gravitational force. The particle velocities obtained for various clusters from their temperature profiles match the velocity produced by the MONG gravitational force. Thus, the increase in the gravitational potential at the outskirts of galaxies balances the thermal pressure of the ICM, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium without invoking DM. The effect of MONG on the angular momentum of galaxies is also studied by obtaining a scaling relation between the angular momentum and the mass of a galaxy. MONG predicts a higher dependence on mass in comparison to the \Lambda-CDM model. This increased dependence on mass compensates for the halo contribution to the angular momentum. The angular momentum from MONG for galaxies from the SPARC database is compared to the halo angular momentum by a Chi-square fit technique. The correlation coefficient is found to be unity, showing a replicable result.</description>

Abstract: We suggest that a gauge theory CP-violating phase could be degenerate with a magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux. Discrete discharge of this flux by membrane nucleations could reduce the total CP-violating phase to below $10^{-10}$ well before BBN if the charge and the tension of the membranes are in the $\sim keV$ range.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate parameter estimation of high-redshift sources with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, will be a key instrument for detecting GWs in the coming decades. However, analyzing the data and estimating source parameters will be challenging, especially given the large number of expected detections - of order $10^5$ per year - which makes current methods based on stochastic sampling impractical. In this work, we use Dingo-IS to perform Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) of high-redshift events detectable with ET in its triangular configuration. NPE is a likelihood-free inference technique that leverages normalizing flows to approximate posterior distributions. After training, inference is fast, requiring only a few minutes per source, and accurate, as corrected through importance sampling and validated against standard Bayesian inference methods. To confirm previous findings on the ability to estimate parameters for high-redshift sources with ET, we compare NPE results with predictions from the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We find that FIM underestimates sky localization errors substantially for most sources, as it does not capture the multimodalities in sky localization introduced by the geometry of the triangular detector. FIM also overestimates the uncertainty in luminosity distance by a factor of $\sim 3$ on average when the injected luminosity distance is $d^{\mathrm{inj}}_{\mathrm{L}} &gt; 10^5~$Mpc, further confirming that ET will be particularly well suited for studying the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with various data sets and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. Further, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is one of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. Using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN) and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of the evolution of dark matter in the dynamical dark matter (DDM) model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Based on CMB data, we find a very strong linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing the single-parameter DDM model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm}a$, where the $\sim2\,\sigma$ DDM evidences is well captured and even strengthened. We demonstrate that there are beyond $2\,\sigma$ evidences of the coexistence of DDM and dynamical dark energy using the combinations of CMB, DESI BAO and Pantheon+ SN data. In such models, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we verify that the universe remains in a matter-dominated state for a substantial period in the past, accelerate in the distant future and finally becomes completely dominated by dark matter. We propose that the ultimate fate of the universe is the ``Super Rip'' induced by dark matter with an extremely negative pressure. Our findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing understanding of cosmic acceleration and deepen our insight into the universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall as Cosmological Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the domain wall within the framework of a cosmological harmonic oscillator. We investigate the interaction between the domain wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in the oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for resolving the domain wall problem through the phenomenon of resonant oscillation. Resonant oscillation occurs when the frequency of the external driving force aligns with the intrinsic frequency of the domain wall. This synchrony can significantly amplify the amplitude of the oscillation. If the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation threshold, the domain wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Priors Improve Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy shows great promise in determining nuclear physics in a regime not accessible to terrestrial experiments. We introduce physics-informed priors constrained by nuclear theory and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics calculations, as well as astrophysical measurements of neutron-star masses and radii. When these priors are used in gravitational-wave astrophysical inference, we show a significant improvement on nuclear equation of state constraints. Applying these to the first observed gravitational-wave binary neutron-star merger GW170817, the constraints on the radius of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star improve from $R_{1.4} ={12.54^{+1.05}_{-1.54}} \, {\rm km}$ to $R_{1.4} = 12.11^{+0.91}_{-1.11} \,{\rm km}$ and those on the tidal deformability from $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.186} &lt; 720$ to $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.186} = 384^{+306}_{-158}$ ($90\%$ confidence intervals) at the events measured chirp mass $\mathcal{M}=1.186\,M_\odot$. We also show these priors can be used to perform model selection between binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers; in the case of GW190425, the results provide only marginal evidence with a Bayes factor $\mathcal{BF}=1.33$ in favour of the binary neutron star merger hypothesis. Given their ability to improve the astrophysical inference of binary mergers involving neutron stars, we advocate for these physics-informed priors to be used as standard in the literature and provide open-source code for reproducibility and adaptation of the method.</description>

      <title>On the difficulty of capturing the distribution function of neutrinos in neutron star merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about nuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help us elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about the properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of neutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions for these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of neutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\nu$ for the number of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing neutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\nu)$. Recent simulations focused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve neutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\nu$ over momentum space, preventing direct calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an attractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos. Their current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\nu$: in our most recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst cases, estimates of $f_\nu$ to jump from $f_\nu=0$ to $f_\nu\sim 10^5$. While this is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos has been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid direct calculations of $f_\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at which this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively simple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\nu$ can in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a combination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and smoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the merger simulation uses.</description>

      <title>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</description>

      <title>Holography and Causality in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy intermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in an explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there can be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic intermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation. We use this example to study potential implications of the bulk geodesic shortcut. We find that there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement between the two branes that is directly correlated with the extra-dimensional geometry. This could affect the low-energy regime when there are interactions between low and high energy modes. Our model makes it clear that any possible causality violation can only arise from the UV. Independently of the quantization, an intermediate description should be valid as an EFT.</description>

Abstract: A novel procedure is presented which allows the construction of all axial vector fields on Riemannian two-spheres. Using these axial vector fields and the centre-of-mass unit sphere reference systems, a constructive definition of quasi-local spin-angular momentum is introduced. Balance relations are also derived, with respect to arbitrary Lie-propagated unit sphere reference systems, to characterize the angular momentum transports in spacetimes without symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an emergent cosmological model rooted in the Asymptotically Safe antiscreening behavior of the Newton constant at Planckian energies. Distinguishing itself from prior approaches, our model encapsulates the variable nature of $G$ through a multiplicative coupling within the matter Lagrangian, characterized by a conserved energy-momentum tensor. The universe emerges from a quasi-de Sitter phase, transitioning to standard cosmological evolution post-Planck Era. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constraining the transition scale to nearly classical cosmology using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the potential to empirically probe the antiscreening trait of Newton's constant, as predicted by Asymptotic Safety.</description>

      <title>ESIGMAHM: An Eccentric, Spinning inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with Higher Modes for the detection and characterization of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-domain inspiral-merger-ringdowm (IMR) waveform model ESIGMAHM constructed within a framework we named ESIGMA for coalescing binaries of spinning black holes on moderately eccentric orbits (Huerta et al. (2018) [Phys. Rev. D 97, 024031]). We now include the effect of black hole spins on the dynamics of eccentric binaries, as well as model sub-dominant waveform harmonics emitted by them. The inspiral evolution is described by a consistent combination of latest results from post-Newtonian theory, self-force, and black hole perturbation theory. We assume that these moderately eccentric binaries radiate away most of their orbital eccentricity before merger, and seamlessly connect the eccentric inspiral with a numerical relativity based surrogate waveform model for mergers of spinning binaries on quasi-circular orbits. We validate ESIGMAHM against eccentric Numerical Relativity simulations, and also against contemporary effective-one-body and phenomenological models in the quasi-circular limit. We find that ESIGMAHM achieves match values greater than $99\%$ for quasi-circular spin-aligned binaries with mass ratios up to $8$, and above $97\%$ for non-spinning and spinning eccentric systems with small or positively aligned spins. Using IMRESIGMA, we quantify the impact of orbital eccentricity on GW signals, showing that next-generation detectors can detect eccentric sources up to $10\%$ louder than quasi-circular ones. We also show that current templated LIGO-Virgo searches will lose more than $10\%$ of optimal SNR for about $20\%$ of all eccentric sources by using only quasi-circular waveform templates. The same will result in a $25\%$ loss in detection rate for eccentric sources with mass ratios $m_1/m_2\geq 4$. Our results highlight the need for including eccentricity and higher-order modes in GW source models and searches for asymmetric eccentric BBH signals.</description>

      <title>Horizon classification via Riemannian flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that the geometry of connected totally geodesic compact null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds is only slightly more specialized than that of Riemannian flows over compact manifolds, the latter mathematical theory having been much studied in the context of foliation theory since the work by Reinhart (Ann Math 69:119, 1959). We are then able to import results on Riemannian flows to the horizon case, so obtaining theorems on the dynamical structure of compact horizons that do not rely on (non-)degeneracy assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between isometric/geodesible Riemannian flows and non-degeneracy conditions. This work also contains some positive results on the possibility of finding, in the degenerate case, lightlike fields tangent to the horizon that have zero surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Gravitational Wave Background Search with a Network of Space-borne Triangular Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circularly polarized gravitational wave backgrounds are predicted in many well-motivated models of inflation and phase transitions involving spontaneous parity violation. In this work, we investigate the detection of such parity-violating signals with the network of two space-borne triangular detectors. We derive the general analytical formula for the overlap reduction functions of networks composed of two triangular detectors, by exploiting the system's symmetrical properties under the long-wave approximation. Based on these results, we further assess the detectability of a parity-violating background with alternative LISA-Taiji network configurations. We find that the sensitivity to the parity-violating component can be significantly enhanced at low frequencies by adjusting the orientation of Taiji's constellation plane. This sensitivity gain is approximately an order of magnitude around the millihertz band, making the peak sensitivity comparable to that of the total intensity. This provides a promising opportunity to constrain various parity-violating theories in the millihertz band with upcoming space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Amplification of Chiral Gravitational Waves and the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of single-vertex states in quantum-reduced loop gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we examine a Hamiltonian constraint operator governing the dynamics of simple quantum states, whose graph consists of a single six-valent vertex, in quantum-reduced loop gravity. To this end, we first derive the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on generic basis states in the Hilbert space of quantum-reduced loop gravity. Specializing to the example of the single-vertex states, we find that the Euclidean part of the Hamiltonian bears a close formal similarity to the Hamiltonian constraint of Bianchi I models in loop quantum cosmology. Extending the formal analogy to the Lorentzian part of the Hamiltonian suggests a possible modified definition of the Hamiltonian constraint for loop quantum cosmology, in which the Lorentzian part, corresponding to the scalar curvature of the spatial surfaces, is not assumed to be identically vanishing, and is represented by a non-trivial operator in the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universe in f(Q) gravity theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One resolution of the ancient cosmic singularity, i.e., the Big Bang Singularity (BBS), is to assume an inflationary stage preceded by a long enough static state in which the universe and its physical properties would oscillate around certain equilibrium points. The early period is referred to as the Einstein Static (ES) Universe phase, which characterizes a static phase with positive spatial curvature. A stable Einstein static state can serve as a substitute for BBS, followed by an inflationary period known as the Emergent Scenario. The initial need has not been fulfilled within the context of General Relativity, prompting the investigation of modified theories of gravity. The current research aims to find such a solution within the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity, specifically in the trendy $f(Q)$ theories. An analysis has been conducted to investigate stable solutions for both positively and negatively curved spatial FRW universes, in the presence of a perfect fluid, by utilizing various torsion-free and curvature-free affine connections. Additionally, we propose a method to facilitate an exit from a stable ES to a subsequent inflationary phase. We demonstrate that $f(Q)$ gravity theories have the ability to accurately depict the emergence of the universe.</description>

      <title>New Black Hole Solutions of Second and First Order Formulations of Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the so-called Palatini formulation of General Relativity and of its modifications and extensions, we consider an analogous formulation of the dynamics of a self-interacting gauge field which is determined by non-linear extension of Maxwell's theory, usually known as nonlinear electrodynamics. In this first order formalism the field strength and the gauge potential are treated, a priori as independent, and, as such, varied independently in order to produce the field equations. Accordingly we consider within this formalism alternative and generalized non-linear Lagrangian densities, some of them of a new kind which gives up the restriction of equivalence to second order Lagrangians. Several new spherically-symmetric objects are constructed analytically and their main properties are studied. The solutions are obtained in flat spacetime ignoring gravity and for the self-gravitating case with emphasis on black holes. As a background for comparison between the first and second order formalisms, some of the solutions are obtained by the conventional second order formalism, while for others a first order formalism is applied. Among the self-gravitating solutions we find new families of black holes and study their main characteristics. Some of the flat space solutions can regularize the total energy of a point charge and a subset of them exhibit also finite field strength and energy density, although their black hole counterparts are not regular.</description>

Abstract: We analyse linearised field equations around the Minkowski metric with its standard flat parallel transport in models of Newer GR, that is quadratic actions in terms of nonmetricity tensor. We show that half of the freedom in choosing the model parameters is immediately fixed by asking for reasonable properties of tensors and vectors, defined with respect to spatial rotations, and accurately describe the much more complicated sector of scalars. In particular, we show that, from the teleparallel viewpoint, the model of STEGR with addition of a gradient squared of the metric determinant exhibits three halves new dynamical modes, and not just one like it was previously claimed.</description>

We give details on the configuration of the pipeline and its evolution compared to the third observing run (O3). We focus here on the configuration used for the offline results of the first part of the run (O4a), which are part of the GWTC-4 catalog (in preparation). We also give a brief summary of the online configuration and highlight some of the changes implemented or considered for the second part of O4 (O4b).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories linear in the curvature tensor and quadratic in the derivatives of the electromagnetic field strength whose kinetic matrices are degenerate. This provides a generalisation of quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories for a U(1) gauge field. After establishing a classification of the independent Lagrangians, we obtain all the theories with at most third order field equations involving only second order derivatives of the metric, thus generalising Horndeski's quadratic theory for a gauge field. Some of these are shown to be conformally invariant. We then classify degenerate non-minimally coupled interactions, obtaining all conformally invariant ones. Finally, we investigate the effect of U(1)-preserving disformal transformations on these degenerate Lagrangians. The ``mimetic" singular transformations are obtained and new ghost-free degenerate theories are generated.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by charged black hole with global monopole in the strong field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime, focusing on the combined effects of the global monopole and black hole charge on key observables in gravitational lensing both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal that the dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the global monopole. In particular, we identify three critical values of the global monopole parameter that determine whether the angular separation increases monotonically, decreases monotonically, or exhibits extrema as the charge varies. A similar complex dependence is found for the flux ratio as a function of the deficit angle, and for the magnification of the first relativistic image as a function of charge. These behaviors contrast sharply with the monotonic changes observed in the absence of either a global monopole or charge. Our findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopole on gravitational lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions. Instead, their combined effects lead to a rich and interdependent behavior that enhances our understanding of strong-field gravitational lensing. While the charge and global monopole are expected to be small in typical astrophysical contexts, the results presented here could be experimentally explored in analog gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase-space analysis of $f(G)$-theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further $f(G)$ contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit \emph{a priori} the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Acoustic gravitational waves beyond leading order in bubble over Hubble radius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational wave power spectrum from sound waves in a cosmological first order phase transition in the unexplored regime of large bubbles, by which we mean that the mean bubble spacing $R_*$ is a non-negligible fraction of the Hubble length $\mathcal{H}_*^{-1}$, i.e. $R_*\mathcal{H}_* \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$. Since the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal increases with $R_*\mathcal{H}_*$, this is also the loud signal regime. In this regime the effects of gravity, hitherto neglected, become relevant. We carry out the calculation in cosmological perturbation theory expanding in the parameter $R_*\mathcal{H}_*$, or bubble over Hubble radius. The leading order term is the standard result for acoustic production of gravitational waves. At next-to-leading order we find three novel contributions: two contributions arise from general relativistic corrections to the dynamics of both sound and gravitational waves. A third contribution comes from gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations. These contributions suppress the gravitational wave peak amplitude. The suppression factor, with respect to the leading order contribution, scales as $(R_*\mathcal{H}_*)^2$, and also depends on other transition parameters, such as the sound speed $c_s$, the duration of the acoustic source, and the peak wavenumber of the velocity field $k_p$. In a simplified model of the velocity field, we find that the suppression factor lies between $2\%$ and $15\%$ when $R_*\mathcal{H}_* \simeq 0.5$, but is independent of the root mean squared fluid velocity. We provide analytical approximations to the next-to-leading order corrections, and a recipe to join them smoothly across different frequency regimes. Our work improves the precision of the current estimations of the gravitational wave power spectrum in the relatively unexplored regime of phase transition with large bubbles.</description>

      <title>Proca theory of four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet gravity and black holes with primary hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, well-defined four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity by applying a dimensional regularization procedure. The resulting theory is a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class. We then consider the static spherically symmetric solutions of this theory and find black hole solutions that acquire primary hair. Notably, one of the integration constants associated with the Proca field is not manifest in the original metric, but under a disformal transformation of the seed solution, it emerges as a second, independent primary hair. This additional hair acts as an effective cosmological constant in the disformed geometry, even in the absence of a bare cosmological constant term. We further generalize these black hole solutions to include electromagnetic charges and effects related to the scalar-tensor counterparts of the regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory. We discuss the implications of our findings to observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings in LISA: reconstruction pipeline and physics interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the LISA template databank for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds sourced by cosmic strings. We include two templates, an analytical template, which enables more flexible searches, and a numerical template derived directly from large Nambu-Goto simulations of string networks. Using searches based on these templates, we forecast the parameter space within the reach of the experiment and the precision with which their parameters will be reconstructed, provided a signal is observed. The reconstruction permits probing the Hubble expansion and new relativistic DoF in the early universe. We quantify the impact that astrophysical foregrounds can have on these searches. Finally, we discuss the impact that these observations would have on our understanding of the fundamental models behind the string networks. Overall, we prove that LISA has great potential for probing cosmic string models and may reach tensions as low as $G\mu =10^{-16} - 10^{-17} $, which translates into energy scales of the order $10^{11}~\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a well-motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. Using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based analysis of the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lies in a region that excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 3.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduces the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforce the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, avoiding the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

Abstract: The scattering amplitudes of string theory exhibit many extraordinary properties. But are they the unique mathematical objects to do so? Recently, it has been shown how the spectrum and amplitudes of open string theory follow directly from the assumptions of faster than power-law falloff at high energies and a property dubbed level truncation. At present there is no analogous principle for closed string scattering, which is famously rigid and naively impervious to modification. In this paper we analytically bootstrap the spectrum and four-point amplitudes of the closed string -- together with a parameterized space of deformations -- from conditions on high-energy falloff and level truncation. While these deformations exhibit the same Regge scaling as pure gravity, in the tensionless limit they reproduce remarkable extremal amplitudes that have appeared in bottom-up studies of positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a study of the subleading structure of the asymptotic equations of motion in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, we construct charges that are conserved up to quadratic order in non-radiative vacuum. We then show that these higher spin charges obey the celestial $sw_{1+\infty}$ symmetry algebra found earlier from the OPE of positive-helicity conformally soft gluons and gravitons.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Lorentzian left-invariant metrics on almost abelian Lie groups of dimensions larger than three. An almost abelian Lie group is a Lie group whose Lie algebra has a codimension one abelian ideal. Ricci-flat and non-flat conditions on the Lie algebra are derived. In particular, we generalize the four-dimensional Petrov solution to arbitrarily higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of DESI DR2 BAO measurements in light of the latest ACT DR6 CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report cosmological results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) when combined with recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). By jointly analyzing ACT and Planck data and applying conservative cuts to overlapping multipole ranges, we assess how different Planck+ACT dataset combinations affect consistency with DESI. While ACT alone exhibits a tension with DESI exceeding 3$\sigma$ within the $\Lambda$CDM model, this discrepancy is reduced when ACT is analyzed in combination with Planck. For our baseline DESI DR2 BAO+Planck PR4+ACT likelihood combination, the preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant is about 3$\sigma$, increasing to over 4$\sigma$ with the inclusion of Type Ia supernova data. While the dark energy results remain quite consistent across various combinations of Planck and ACT likelihoods with those obtained by the DESI collaboration, the constraints on neutrino mass are more sensitive, ranging from $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.061$ eV in our baseline analysis, to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.077$ eV (95\% confidence level) in the CMB likelihood combination chosen by ACT when imposing the physical prior $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$ eV.</description>
