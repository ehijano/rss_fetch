      <title>Confronting CP symmetry of order 4 with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP4 3HDM is a three-Higgs-doublet model based on a $CP$ symmetry of order 4 (CP4). It is the minimal model incorporating CP4 without leading to accidental symmetries or running into immediate conflict with experiment. Imposing CP4 on the lagrangian induces remarkably tight connections between the scalar and Yukawa sectors, including the unavoidable tree-level flavor-changing neutral couplings (FCNC). Here, we explore whether it is at all possible in the CP4 3HDM to suppressed FCNC to a level compatible with the neutral meson oscillation constraints. We express the FCNC matrices in terms of physical quark observables and quark rotation parameters, and scan the Yukawa parameter space using the quark masses and mixing parameters as input. With this procedure, we find that only two out of the eight possible CP4 Yukawa sectors are compatible with the $K$, $B$, $B_s$ and, in particular, $D$-meson oscillation constraints. The results clearly indicate a way how to construct phenomenologically viable benchmark CP4 3HDMs.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of entanglement and hadronization in jet production: lessons from the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible link between entanglement and thermalization, and the dynamics of hadronization are addressed by studying the real-time response of the massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. This setup mimics the production and fragmentation of quark jets, as the Schwinger model and QCD share the properties of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. By using quantum simulations on classical hardware, we study the entanglement between the produced jets, and observe the growth of the corresponding entanglement entropy in time. This growth arises from the increased number of contributing eigenstates of the reduced density matrix with sufficiently large and close eigenvalues. We also investigate the physical nature of these eigenstates, and find that at early times they correspond to fermionic Fock states. We then observe the transition from these fermionic Fock states to meson-like bound states as a function of time. In other words, we observe how hadronization develops in real time. At late times, the local observables at mid-rapidity (such as the fermion density and the electric field) approach approximately constant values, suggesting the onset of equilibrium and approach to thermalization.</description>

      <title>N$^3$LO soft-gluon corrections in single-particle-inclusive kinematics and $H^+ H^-$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the complete soft-gluon corrections for the production of colorless final states through N$^3$LO in single-particle-inclusive kinematics. We present explicit analytical results and use them to study higher-order QCD corrections for the production of a heavy charged Higgs pair ($H^+ H^-$) via quark-antiquark annihilation in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model at LHC energies. We calculate the NNLO soft-gluon and virtual QCD corrections as well as the N$^3$LO soft-gluon corrections to the total cross section and the charged-Higgs rapidity distribution. This is the first calculation of complete N$^3$LO soft-gluon corrections for a process in single-particle-inclusive kinematics, and the results can be applied to other processes with colorless final states.</description>

      <title>Cosmological mass of the photon related to Stueckelberg and Higgs mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider electro-weak (EW) masses and interactions generated for photons by vacuum expectation values of Stueckelberg and Higgs fields. I provide a prescription to relate their parametric values to a cosmological range derived from a fundamental Heisenberg uncertainty principle and Einstein-de Sitter cosmological constant and horizon. This yields qualitative connections between microscopic ranges acquired by $W^{\pm}$ or $Z^0$ gauge Bosons and the cosmological scale and minimal mass acquired by $g$-photons. I apply that procedure to an established Stueckelberg-Higgs mechanism, while I consider a similar procedure for a pair of Higgs fields that may spontaneously break all U(1)xSU(2) gauge invariances. My estimates of photon masses and their additional parity-breaking interactions with leptons and neutrinos may be detectable in suitable accelerator experiments. Their effects may also be observable astronomically through massive $g$-photon condensates that may contribute to dark matter and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Production and decay of hyperons in transversely polarized electron-positron collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-polarization of relativistic electrons or positrons moving in a magnetic field at a storage ring occurs through the emission of spin-flip synchrotron radiation, known as the Sokolov-Ternov effect. The resulting transverse polarizations of the colliding electrons and positrons, away from the depolarization resonances, allow for precise investigation of the spin entangled hyperon-antihyperon pairs via virtual photon or charmonium decay. The feasibility study reveals a promising increase in the statistical sensitivity of the \CP violation signal after considering the transverse polarizations of the lepton beams.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constraints and the dispersive matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated estimates of $\vert V_{cb} \vert$ and $R(D^{(*)})$ based on all the available theoretical and experimental data on semileptonic $B \to D^{(*)} \ell \nu_\ell$ decays. These values have been obtained by using the Dispersive Matrix method to describe the hadronic form factors. By analysing all the lattice data we get the theoretical values $R^{\rm th}(D) = 0.296 \pm 0.008$ and $R^{\rm th}(D^*) = 0.262 \pm 0.009$, which are consistent with the corresponding HFLAV averages at the $\simeq 2.0\,\sigma$ and the $\simeq 1.5\,\sigma$ level, respectively. Moreover, from a bin-per-bin study of the experimental data we obtain the values $\vert V_{cb} \vert = (41.0 \pm 1.2) \cdot10^{-3}$ from $B \to D$ decay and $\vert V_{cb} \vert = (39.92 \pm 0.64) \cdot10^{-3}$ from $B \to D^*$ one, whose differences with the latest inclusive determinations never exceed the $\simeq 2.5\,\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>A new method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation: Estimation of the weights of $C$, $P$ and $CP$ symmetry violating terms in positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Meson mass and width: Deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is fascinating to predict the mass and width of the ordinary and exotic mesons solely based on their quark content and quantum numbers. Such prediction goes beyond conventional methodologies traditionally employed in hadron physics for calculating or estimating these quantities. The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known. Our predictions obtained through the DNNs, will be useful for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Chromomagnetic dipole moments of light quarks in the Bestest Little Higgs Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we research into the anomalous Chromomagnetic Dipole Moment (CMDM), denoted as $\hat{\mu}_{q}^{BLHM}$, of the light quarks $q=(u, c, d, s, b)$ within the framework of the Bestest Little Higgs Model (BLHM) as an extension of the Standard Model (SM). Our investigation encompasses novel interactions among the light quarks, the heavy quark $B$, and the heavy bosons $(W^{\prime\pm}, H^{\pm}, \phi^{\pm}, \eta^{\pm})$, incorporating the extended Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix characteristic of the BLHM. We thoroughly explore the permissible parameter space, yielding a spectrum of CMDM values ranging from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Electric Dipole Moments in 5+3 Flavor Weak Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully generic treatment of electric dipole moments (EDMs) is presented in the CP-violating and flavor-conserving weak effective field theory (WET) with five flavors of quarks and three flavors of leptons. We systematically analyze leading contributions to EDMs originating from QCD and QED renormalization group running between the electroweak scale and low energy scales of about 2 GeV. We include the full one-loop anomalous dimension and a subset of two-loop corrections, as well as threshold corrections at the bottom, charm and $\tau$ masses. This allows us to derive master formulae in the space of generic WET for the neutron and proton EDMs, for EDMs of diamagnetic atoms, and the precession frequencies constrained in molecular EDM experiments, from which bounds on the electron EDM are extracted. In particular, our master formulae capture the contributions of WET CP-violating operators with heavy quark and lepton flavors. As an application, we study EDM constraints on the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson, in both the linear and non-linear realizations of electroweak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group directly formulated in $d=3$ spatial dimensions with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators. We find infrared fixed points spanned throughout the entire flavor number range that are inaccessible in the $\epsilon$ expansion. Stability analyses around the fixed points show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_A(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order transition, which could become almost continuous if the axial symmetry breaking is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from slow phase transitions: a model-building perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) through delayed vacuum decay during slow cosmic first-order phase transitions. Two specific models, the polynomial potential and the real singlet extension of the Standard Model, are used as illustrative examples. Our findings reveal that models with zero-temperature scalar potential barriers are conducive to the realization of this mechanism, as the phase transition duration is extended by the U-shaped Euclidean action. We find that the resulting PBH density is highly sensitive to the barrier height, with abundant PBH formation observed for sufficiently high barriers. Notably, the phase transition needs NOT to be super-strong, and the commonly used exponential nucleation approximation $\Gamma(t)\sim e^{\beta t}$ fails to capture the PBH formation dynamics in such models.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the total 10-th order QED contribution to the lepton magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total 5-loop quantum electrodynamics universal contribution to the anomalous magnetic moments of the leptons was calculated by the author. The obtained value $A_1^{(10)}=5.891(61)$ provides the first complete verification of the previously known value obtained by T. Aoyama, M. Hayakawa, T. Kinoshita, M. Nio (AHKN). The discrepancy is $5 \sigma$. The computation includes the recalculation of the part that the author calculated in 2019 using a slightly different method and the calculation of the remaining part of the coefficient. A comparison with the AHKN values in 32 gauge-invariant classes is provided. In addition, the results are divided into 95 small gauge-invariant classes that subdivide the former ones. Such a detailzation is provided for the first time. The method described in previous works of the author was used in general. However, the Monte Carlo integration method is new and is described in detail. Some useful technical information and information on numerical cancellations is also given.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in sterile neutrino dark matter in feeble gauged $B-L$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ model and examine the situation where the sterile neutrino is a dark matter candidate produced by the freeze-in mechanism. In our model, the dark matter $N$ is mainly produced by the decay of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scalar field $\phi$. We point out that the on-shell production of $\phi$ through annihilation of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge field $Z'$ plays an important role. We find that the single production of $Z'$ from the photon bath is one of the main production processes of $Z'$. To prevent $N$ from being overproduced, we show that the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge coupling constant $g_{B-L}$ must be as small as $10^{-13}$-$10^{-10}$. We also consider the case where the decay of $\phi$ into $N$ is kinematically forbidden. In this case, $N$ is generated by the scattering of $Z'$ and the $g_{B-L}$ takes values of $10^{-7}$-$10^{-6}$, which can be explored in collider experiments like FASER.</description>

      <title>Scatophobic Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An outstanding mystery of dark matter physics is the lack of direct detection signals to date. We suggest that dark matter is scatophobic: due to a repulsive long-range interaction, it is repelled by objects with a large net scat charge, such as the Earth, and is therefore not able to reach direct detection experiments. This represents the first step in a broader theoretical paradigm that we dub the "anti-anthropic principle."</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of weak transition form factors, semileptonic decays, and nonleptonic decays of $B_c$ meson involving pseudoscalar ($P$) and vector ($V$) meson for bottom-conserving and bottom-changing decay modes. We employ self-consistent covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM), termed as Type-II correspondence, to calculate the $B_c$ to $P(V)$ transition form factors. The Type-II correspondence in the CLF approach gives self-consistent results associated with the $B^{(i)}_j$ functions, which vanish numerically after the replacement $M^{\prime(\prime\prime)} \to M_0^{\prime(\prime\prime)}$ in traditional Type-I correspondence, and the covariance of the matrix elements is also restored. We investigate these effects on bottom conserving $B_c \to P(V)$ form factors that have not yet been studied in CLFQM Type-II correspondence. In addition, we quantify the implications of self-consistency propagating to weak decays involving both bottom-conserving and bottom-changing $B_c$ transition form factors. We use two different parameterizations, the usual three-parameter function of $q^2$ and the model-independent $z$-series expansion, to establish a clear understanding of $q^2$ dependence. Using the numerical values of the form factors, we predict the branching ratios and other physical observables, such as, forward-backward asymmetries, polarization fractions, etc., of the semileptonic $B_c$ decays. We extend our analysis to predict the branching ratios of two-body nonleptonic weak decays using the factorization hypothesis in self-consistent CLFQM. We also compare our results with those of other theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy optical clocks with sensitivity to the fine-structure constant variation based on Sm$ ^{10+} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify two metastable excited states in Sm$ ^{10+} $ highly charged ion as candidates for high accuracy optical clocks. Several atomic properties relevant to optical clock development are calculated using relativistic many-body methods. This includes energy levels, transition amplitudes, lifetimes, scalar polarizabilities, black body radiation shift, and the sensitivity to the fine structure constant variation. We found that the clock transitions are not sensitive to perturbation, e.g., relative black body radiation shifts are $\sim 10^{-19}$. The enhancement factor for the $\alpha$ variation is $\sim$ 0.8 for one clock transition and $\sim$ 16 for another.</description>

      <title>$A_4$ modular invariance and the strong CP problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simple effective theory of quark masses, mixing and CP violation with level $N=3$ ($A_4$) modular symmetry, which provides solution to the strong CP problem without the need for an axion. The vanishing of the strong CP-violating phase $\bar \theta$ is ensured by assuming CP to be a fundamental symmetry of the Lagrangian of the theory. The CP symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the modulus $\tau$. This provides the requisite large value of the CKM CP-violating phase while the strong CP phase $\bar \theta$ remains zero or is tiny. Within the considered framework we discuss phenomenologically viable quark mass matrices with three types of texture zeros, which are realized by assigning both the left-handed and right-handed quark fields to $A_4$ singlets ${\bf 1}$, ${\bf 1'}$ and ${\bf 1''}$ with appropriate weights. The VEV of $\tau$ is restricted to reproduce the observed CKM parameters. We discuss, in particular, cases in which the modulus VEV is close to the fixed points $i$, $\omega$ and $i\infty$, which are broadly consistent with the results on modulus stabilisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate detailed properties of imaginary rotating matter with gluons and quarks at high temperature. Previously, we showed that imaginary rotation induces perturbative confinement of gluons at the rotation center. We perturbatively calculate the Polyakov loop potential and find inhomogeneous confinement above a certain threshold of imaginary angular velocity. We also evaluate the quark contribution to the Polyakov loop potential and confirm that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the perturbatively confined phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a stable vortex soliton, carrying a constant magnetic flux, exists in the homogeneous medium of axions with a constant time-derivative. Axions can be bound in the vortex, having energy less than the axion mass. If the observed magnetic fields in galaxies are those of the vortex, the axion-photon coupling has to be smaller than $10^{-17}\,{\rm GeV^{-1}}$. Otherwise, axions decay too quickly to constitute dark matter in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Optimised observables and new physics prospects in the penguin-mediated decays $B_{d(s)}\to K^{(*)0}\phi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the penguin-mediated decays $\bar{B}_{d(s)}\to\bar{K}^{*0}(K^{*0})\phi$ transitions. We propose a new optimised observable $L_{K^*\phi}$ from the ratio of longitudinal branching ratios of these decays, with limited hadronic uncertainties and enhanced sensitivity to New Physics. It exhibits a deviation at the $1.48\, \sigma$ level between its experimental value and its SM determination within QCD factorisation. This result can be accommodated together with the significant deviations found for the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ modes in our earlier works, if New Physics affects either the QCD penguin operator $Q_4$ or the chromomagnetic dipole operator $Q_{8g}$ for both $b\to d$ and $b\to s$ transitions. The allowed range for the Wilson coefficients $C_{4s,8gs}$ is narrower compared to $C_{4d,8gd}$ since the $b\to s$ transition $\bar{B}_d\to\bar{K}^{*0}\phi$) is in better agreement with the SM. If we add the measured longitudinal branching ratio for the $\bar{B}_{d}\to \bar{K}^{0}\phi$ to our analysis, the simultaneous explanation of all the experimental data for the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ and the $K^*(\bar{K}^{(*)})\phi$ channels in terms of New Physics in $C_{4d,s}$ or $C_{8gd,s}$ operators only becomes very constrained. This set of observables can be explained more easily if we assume New Physics either in $(C_{4f},C_{6f})$ or $C_{6f},C_{8gf}$ in both $f=d,s$. This should provide a strong incentive for the LHCb experiment to perform a new measurement of the longitudinal branching ratio for $\bar{B}_{d}\to\bar{K}^{*0}\phi$, measured only by BaBar and Belle.</description>

      <title>Nonfactorizable charming-loop contribution to FCNC $B_s\to \gamma l^+l^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical calculation of nonfactorizable charm-quark loop contributions to the $B_s\to \gamma l^+l^-$ amplitude. We calculate the relevant form factors, $H_{A,V}^{\rm NF}(k'^2,k^2)$, and provide convenient parametrizations of our results in the form of fit functions of two variables, $k'^2$ and $k^2$, applicable in the region below hadron resonances, $k'^2 &lt; M_{J/\psi}^2$ and $k^2 &lt; M_{\phi}^2$. We report that factorizable and nonfactorizable charm contributions to the $B_s\to\gamma l^+l^-$ amplitude have opposite signs. To compare the charm and the top contributions, it is convenient to express the NF charming loop contribution as a non-universal (i.e., dependent on the reaction) $q^2$-dependent correction $\Delta^{\rm NF}C_7(q^2)$ to the Wilson coefficient $C_7$. For the $B_s\to\gamma l^+l^-$ amplitude, the correction is found to be positive, $\Delta^{\rm NF} C_7(q^2)/C_7 &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectra of Full-Heavy and Double-Heavy Tetraquark States in the Conventional Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of the $S$-wave heavy tetraquark states with identical quarks and antiquarks, specifically $QQ{\bar Q'}\bar Q'$ ($Q, Q'=c,b$), $QQ\bar s\bar s$/$\bar Q\bar Q ss$, and $QQ\bar q\bar q$/$\bar Q\bar Q qq$ ($q=u,d$), are studied in a unified constituent quark model. This model contains the one-gluon exchange and confinement potentials. The latter is modeled as the sum of all two-body linear potentials. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the full four-body Schr\"{o}dinger equations, and search bound and resonant states using the complex-scaling method. We then identify $3$ bound and $62$ resonant states. The bound states are all $QQ\bar q\bar q$ states with the isospin and spin-parity quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$: two bound $bb\bar{q}\bar{q}$ states with the binding energies, 153 MeV and 4 MeV below the $BB^*$ threshold, and a shallow $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}$ state at $-15$ MeV from the $DD^*$ threshold. The deeper $bb\bar q \bar q$ bound state aligns with the lattice QCD predictions, while $cc\bar q\bar q$ bound state, still has a much larger binding energy than the recently observed $T^+_{cc}$ by LHCb collaboration. No bound states are identified for the $QQ\bar Q'\bar Q'$, $QQ\bar s\bar s$ and $QQ\bar q\bar q$ with $I=1$. Our analysis shows that the bound $QQ\bar Q'\bar Q'$ states are more probable with a larger mass ratio, $m_Q/m_{Q'}$. Experimental investigation for these states is desired, which will enrich our understanding of hadron spectroscopy and probe insights into the confinement mechanisms within tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>Searching for enhancement in coalescence of in-jet (anti-)deuterons in proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements from ALICE report that $``$in-jet'' nucleons carry a higher probability of forming a deuteron via coalescence than the nucleons from the underlying event (UE). This study makes use of an event shape classifier to separate the $``$in-jet'' deuterons and the deuterons in the UE produced in high multiplicity proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Event shape variables such as transverse spherocity allow the categorization of hard and soft components of an event, which can be divided into two respective classes; $``$jetty'' and $``$isotropic''. The $``$jetty'' deuterons minus the contribution of the deuterons from the $``$isotropic'' event are taken as $``$in-jet'' deuterons, and the coalescence mechanism is tested. The coalescence is performed with a Wigner function formalism, augmented as an afterburner to \textsc{pythia}8. The possible enhancement of the coalescence probability of $``$in-jet'' deuterons is investigated by calculating the coalescence parameter ($B_{2}$) in different spherocity classes in high-multiplicity $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <title>On the potential of Light-Cone Sum Rules without Quark-Hadron Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the calculation of local form factors involved in the theoretical predictions of semileptonic $B$-meson decays at low-$q^2$. We present a new approach to the method of QCD Light-Cone Sum Rule with $B-$meson Light-Cone Distribution Amplitudes. In our strategy, we bypass the quark-hadron duality (QHD) approximation which usually contributes an unknown and potentially large systematic error to the prediction of form factors. We trade this improvement for an increased reliance on higher-order contributions in perturbation theory. Unlike the systematic error from QHD, truncation errors are assessable and systematically improvable, hence allowing robust predictions of form factors. For the transitions $B\to \pi,\rho,K^{(*)}$, our predictions agree with the literature for all form factors at $q^2=0$.</description>

      <title>Oscillations in the Dark?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to use a model-independent approach, along with late-time observational probes, to reconstruct the dark energy (DE) equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. Our analysis showed that, for a late time universe, $w_{\rm DE}$ deviates from being a constant but in contrast exhibits an oscillatory behavior, hence both quintessence ($w_{\rm DE}&gt; -1$) and phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) regimes are equally allowed. In order to portray this oscillatory behavior, we explored various parametrizations for the equation of state and identified the closest approximation based on the goodness of fit with the data and the Bayesian evidence analysis. Our findings indicated that while all considered oscillating DE parametrizations provided a better fit to the data, compared to the cosmological constant, they are penalized in the Bayesian evidence analysis due to the additional free parameters. Overall, the present article demonstrates that in the low redshift regime, the equation of state of the DE prefers to be dynamical and oscillating. We anticipate that future cosmological probes will take a stand in this direction.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quark in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic bases with hadronic and partonic degrees-of-freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which controls the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of pairs of anti-charm/charm quarks through the rotation of Feynman diagrams using cross symmetry for elastic scattering of charm quark with thermal partons ((anti-)quarks or gluons) in the sQGP by the exchange of the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Comparing with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant Induced by Field Fluctuations in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in our universe have sparked controversy. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that some of these black holes may have seeded from the direct collapse of dark energy domains with density significantly higher than the surrounding regions. The mechanism of the origin of such domains relies on the inflationary evolution of a scalar field acting in D dimensions, which is associated with the cosmological constant in our four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Inner space quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation are responsible for the spatial variations of the dark energy density in our space. This finding holds particular significance, especially considering recent evidence from pulsar timing array observations, which supports the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background consisting of SMBH mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze particle number fluctuations in the crossover region near the critical endpoint of a first-order phase transition by utilizing molecular dynamics simulations of the classical Lennard-Jones fluid. We extend our previous study [V.A. Kuznietsov et al., Phys. Rev. C 105, 044903 (2022)] by incorporating longitudinal collective flow. The scaled variance of particle number distribution inside different coordinate and momentum space acceptances is computed through ensemble averaging and found to agree with earlier results obtained using time averaging, validating the ergodic hypothesis for fluctuation observables. Presence of a sizable collective flow is found to be essential for observing large fluctuations from the critical point in momentum space acceptances. We discuss our findings in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Prospects of nuclear-coupled-dark-matter detection via correlation spectroscopy of I$_2^+$ and Ca$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) and its interaction with the Standard Model (SM) is one of the biggest open questions in physics nowadays. The vast majority of theoretically-motivated Ultralight-DM (ULDM) models predict that ULDM couples dominantly to the SM strong/nuclear sector. This coupling leads to oscillations of nuclear parameters that are detectable by comparing clocks with different sensitivities to these nature's constants. Vibrational transitions of molecular clocks are more sensitive to a change in the nuclear parameters than the electronic transitions of atomic clocks. Here, we propose the iodine molecular ion, I$_2^+$, as a sensitive detector for such a class of ULDM models. The iodine's dense spectrum allows us to match its transition frequency to that of an optical atomic clock (Ca$^+$) and perform correlation spectroscopy between the two clock species. With this technique, we project a few-orders-of-magnitude improvement over the most sensitive clock comparisons performed to date. We also briefly consider the robustness of the corresponding "Earth-bound" under modifications of the $Z_N$-QCD axion model.</description>

      <title>Stringy constraints on primordial electromagnetic fields in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study primordial electromagnetic fields in effective actions of string theory. In contrast to a conventional scenario of producing primordial electromagnetic fields induced by the axion inflation, we deal with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action as a non-linear generation of Maxwell theory. It turns out that the intensity of generated electromagnetic fields is bounded from above by the string scale which can also be rewritten in terms of supersymmetry breaking scale in the context of type IIB Large Volume Scenario. The instability parameter $\xi$ is constrained by the tadpole cancellation condition of D3-branes and a realization of hierarchy between the string scale and the Hubble scale of inflation.</description>

      <title>Dark photon constraints from a 7.139 GHz cavity haloscope experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark photon is a promising candidate for the dark matter which comprises most of the matter in our visible Universe. Via kinetic mixing with the Standard Model it can also be resonantly converted to photons in an electromagnetic cavity, offering novel experimental possibilities for the discovery and study of dark matter. We report the results of a pathfinder dark photon dark matter cavity search experiment performed at Hunan Normal University and the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, representing the first stage of the APEX (Axion and dark Photon EXperiment) program. Finding no statistically significant excess, we place an upper limit on the kinetic mixing parameter $|\chi|&lt;3.7\times 10^{-13}$ around $m_A\simeq 29.5$ $\mu$eV at 90% confidence level. This result exceeds other constraints on dark photon dark matter in this frequency range by roughly an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance of radiative jet functions in the position-space formulation of SCET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In subleading powers of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), the Lagrangian contains couplings between soft quarks and hard-collinear quarks. Matrix elements of the hard-collinear parts of these couplings are radiative jet functions. In the position-space formulation of SCET, the Lagrangians are constructed from operators that appear to be gauge invariant. Nevertheless, we find violations of gauge invariance arise in the hard-collinear sector because gauge transformations can shift the momentum of a hard-collinear quark field from the hard-collinear sector to the soft sector, where the hard-collinear fields, by definition, have no support. The violations of gauge invariance are manifested in perturbation theory in the hard-collinear sector through the absence of certain Feynman diagrams that would be present in full QCD. A consequence of the absence of these diagrams is that the radiative jet functions that follow directly from the position-space Lagrangians are not gauge invariant, and we demonstrate this through explicit calculations in lower-order perturbation theory. We obtain gauge-invariant Lagrangians by adding to existing position-space Lagrangians terms that are proportional to the soft-quark equation of motion. These gauge-invariant Lagrangians are valid for nonzero, as well as zero, quark masses. We also remark briefly on the gauge invariance of certain Lagrangians that have been constructed in the label-momentum formulation of SCET.</description>

      <title>Limits on High-Frequency Gravitational Waves in Planetary Magnetospheres</title>

Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) carry a wealth of information on the early Universe with a tiny comoving horizon and astronomical objects of small scale but with dense energy. We demonstrate that the nearby planets, such as Earth and Jupiter, can be utilized as a laboratory for detecting the HFGWs. These GWs are then expected to convert to signal photons in the planetary magnetosphere, across the frequency band of astronomical observation. As a proof of concept, we present the first limits from the existing low-Earth-orbit satellite for specific frequency bands and project the sensitivities for the future more-dedicated detections. The first limits from Juno, the latest mission orbiting Jupiter, are also presented. Attributed to the long path of effective GW-photon conversion and the wide angular distribution of signal flux, we find that these limits are highly encouraging, for a broad frequency range including a large portion unexplored before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proposed a viable and predictive model based on the $SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_L \times U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, supplemented by the global $U(1)_{Lg}$ symmetry, the $S_4$ family symmetry and several auxiliary cyclic symmetries, which successfully reproduces the experimentally observed SM fermion mass and mixing pattern. The tiny active neutrino masses are generated through an inverse seesaw mechanism mediated by right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The model is consistent with the SM fermion masses and mixings and successfully accommodates the current Higgs diphoton decay rate constraints as well as the constraints arising from oblique $S$, $T$ and $U$ parameters and we studied the meson mixing due to flavor changing neutral currents mediated by heavy scalars, finding parameter space consistent with experimental constraints.</description>

Abstract: Proton-proton collisions at the LHC generate a high-intensity collimated beam of neutrinos in the forward (beam) direction, characterised by energies of up to several TeV. The recent observation of LHC neutrinos by FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC signals that this hitherto ignored particle beam is now available for scientific inquiry. Here we quantify the impact that neutrino deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the LHC would have on the parton distributions (PDFs) of protons and heavy nuclei. We generate projections for DIS structure functions for FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC at Run III, as well as for the FASER$\nu$2, AdvSND, and FLArE experiments to be hosted at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) operating concurrently with the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). We determine that up to one million electron- and muon-neutrino DIS interactions within detector acceptance can be expected by the end of the HL-LHC, covering a kinematic region in $x$ and $Q^2$ overlapping with that of the Electron-Ion Collider. Including these DIS projections into global (n)PDF analyses, specifically PDF4LHC21, NNPDF4.0, and EPPS21, reveals a significant reduction of PDF uncertainties, in particular for strangeness and the up and down valence PDFs. We show that LHC neutrino data enables improved theoretical predictions for core processes at the HL-LHC, such as Higgs and weak gauge boson production. Our analysis demonstrates that exploiting the LHC neutrino beam effectively provides CERN with a "Neutrino-Ion Collider" without requiring modifications in its accelerator infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Probing the Short-Distance Structure of the Quark-Gluon Plasma with Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-energy-correlators (EEC's) are a promising observable to study the dynamics of jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through its imprint on angular scales in the energy flux of final-state particles. We carry out the first complete calculation of EEC's using realistic simulations of high-energy heavy-ion collisions, and dissect the different dynamics underlying the final distribution through analyses of jet propagation in a uniform medium. The EEC's of $\gamma$-jets in heavy-ion collisions are found to be enhanced by the medium response from elastic scatterings instead of induced gluon radiation at large angles. In the meantime, EEC's are suppressed at small angles due to energy loss and transverse momentum broadening of jet shower partons. These modifications are further shown to be sensitive to the angular scale of the in-medium interaction, as characterized by the Debye screening mass. Experimental verification and measurement of such modifications will shed light on this scale, and the short-distance structure of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions will first realize many nucleon-nucleon scatterings, happening instantaneously and therefore necessarily in parallel, due to the short collision time. An appropriate quantum mechanical tool to treat that problem is S-matrix theory, and it has been known for a long time how to derive a simple geometric probabilistic picture, still widely used, and here the Abramovskii-Gribov-Kancheli (AGK) theorem plays a crucial role. All this is done in a scenario where energy conservation is not taken care of, but this is needed, in particular for Monte Carlo simulations. When introducing energy-momentum sharing properly, the AGK theorem does not apply anymore, nor do simple geometric concepts such as binary scaling. I will discuss this (very serious) problem, and how it can be solved, in the EPOS4 framework. When connecting the multiple Pomeron approach (for parallel scatterings) and perturbative QCD, one is actually forced to implement in a very particular way saturation scales, in order to get an approach free of contradictions. One recovers a generalized AGK theorem (gAGK), valid at large $p_{t}$ (larger than the relevant saturation scales). I discuss how gAGK is related to factorization (in proton-proton scatterings) and binary scaling (in heavy-ion collisions). I will show some applications, using this new approach as an initial condition for hydrodynamical evolutions, for heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 5.02 TeV and 200 GeV, to get some idea about the energy dependence.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Lepton Masses and Mixing with Discrete Flavor Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing is an outstanding puzzle in particle physics, generally known as the flavor problem. Over the years, guided by precision neutrino oscillation data, discrete flavor symmetries have often been used to explain the neutrino mixing parameters, which look very different from the quark sector. In this review, we discuss the application of non-Abelian finite groups to the theory of neutrino masses and mixing in the light of current and future neutrino oscillation data. We start with an overview of the neutrino mixing parameters, comparing different global fit results and limits on normal and inverted neutrino mass ordering schemes. Then, we discuss a general framework for implementing discrete family symmetries to explain neutrino masses and mixing. We discuss CP violation effects, giving an update of CP predictions for trimaximal models with nonzero reactor mixing angle and models with partial $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry, and constraining models with neutrino mass sum rules. The connection between texture zeroes and discrete symmetries is also discussed. We summarize viable higher-order groups, which can explain the observed pattern of lepton mixing where the non-zero $\theta_{13}$ plays an important role. We also review the prospects of embedding finite discrete symmetries in the Grand Unified Theories and with extended Higgs fields. Models based on modular symmetry are also briefly discussed. A major part of the review is dedicated to the phenomenology of flavor symmetries and possible signatures in the current and future experiments at the intensity, energy, and cosmic frontiers. In this context, we discuss flavor symmetry implications for neutrinoless double beta decay, collider signals, leptogenesis, dark matter, as well as gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: Although Feynman integrals in general cannot be expressed as well-studied special functions, they can be calculated systematically and efficiently using the \texttt{AMFlow} method in combination with differential equations in the kinematic space. Therefore, it is constructive to define Feynman integrals as a new class of special functions (or transcedental numbers if there is no kinematic variable). Several crucial avenues for further exploration in this direction are outlined.</description>

Abstract: The addition of a Higgs quadruplet to the standard model (SM) of quarks and leptons would shift the $W$ boson mass upward. It could also facilitate the production of dark matter through the conventional thermal freeze-out scenario via Yukawa interaction with the Higgs quadruplet or freeze-in production from the decay of SM Higgs. We investigate the same-sign lepton smoking gun signature of the double-charged scalar component of the Quadruplet Higgs at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: Dispersion Relations (DR) are known to be a powerful instrument for studying scattering amplitudes. In particular, they often apply to calculations in Perturbative QCD and Standard Model. We argue that applying DR to amplitudes with double-logarithmic (DL) contributions should be done with a proper caution because DL terms are often infrared-divergent. Ignoring this circumstance leads to incorrect results. As an example of such situation, we consider applying DR to decays of on-shell W and Z -bosons into fermion pairs in the Double-Logarithmic Approximation</description>

Abstract: Thermal leptogenesis is a mechanism that explains the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the early universe. In this study, we review the impact of nonextensive Tsallis statistical mechanics on the early universe and study its effect on thermal leptogenesis. The study has found that the use of nonextensive statistical mechanics can affect the production of baryon asymmetry in thermal leptogenesis by modifying the equilibrium abundance of particles, decay, and washout parameters. Also, we show that nonextensive statistical mechanics potentially reduce the required right-handed neutrino mass scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the analysis of transverse single-spin asymmetries $A_N$ in lepton-nucleon scattering where only a single pion is detected in the final state, $\ell\,N^\uparrow\to h\, X$. This observable is the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) analogue to $A_N$ in proton-proton collisions, $p^\uparrow p\to h\,X$, that has been studied intensely for decades, especially at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We incorporate new theoretical developments in the collinear twist-3 framework and utilize recent extractions of (Sivers-like and Collins-like) quark-gluon-quark correlators in the numerical computations. We compare our calculations to HERMES measurements as well as make predictions for Jefferson Lab, COMPASS, and EIC kinematics. We further explore the role of next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the (twist-2) unpolarized cross section (denominator of $A_N$) and consider what can be deduced empirically about the potential numerical significance of the full NLO calculation of $A_N$ in this process. We consider sources of theoretical uncertainty in our predictions, which present potential opportunities then for future measurements to improve our understanding of $A_N$ and multi-parton correlations in hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on lattice QCD results of equation of state (EOS) and baryon number susceptibility at zero baryon chemical potential, and supplemented by machine learning techniques, we construct the analytic form of the holographic black hole metric in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) framework for pure gluon, 2-flavor, and 2+1-flavor systems, respectively. The dilaton potentials solved from Einstein equations are in good agreement with the extended non-conformal DeWolfe-Gubser-Rosen (DGR) type dilaton potentials fixed by lattice QCD EOS, which indicates the robustness of the EMD framework. The predicted critical endpoint (CEP) in the 2+1-flavor system is located at $(T^c$=0.094GeV, $\mu^c_B$=0.74GeV), which is close to the results from the realistic Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio(PNJL) model, the functional renormalization group, and the holographic model with extended DeWolfe-Gubser-Rosen dilaton potential.</description>

      <title>Direct Production of SM-Singlet Scalars at the Muon Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work proposes a minimal extension of the Standard Model~(SM) where a gauge-singlet scalar~($\phi$) can be directly produced at the muon colliders without relying on its mixing with any other doublet state present in the theory. The New Physics~(NP) interactions include a TeV-scale scalar leptoquark of electromagnetic charge 1/3 arising naturally in a grand unifying gauge formulation. Within the proposed framework, the SM-singlet scalar can effectively couple to various SM fields at the one-loop level, out of which the $\bar{\mu}\mu\phi$ and $\gamma\gamma\phi$ couplings are crucial to produce it at the future muon colliders. Assuming $\mathcal{O}(1)$ NP couplings, the decay widths and production cross-section of the singlet scalar have been discussed in detail over the considered parameter space. Depending on the resonance scale, di-lepton and/or di-gluon channels can be significant to test/falsify the model.</description>

      <title>Visualisation of $CP$-violation effects in decay-time-dependent analyses of multibody $B$-meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decay-time-dependent $CP$-violation effects in transitions of neutral $B$ mesons to $CP$-eigenstates can be visualised by oscillations in the asymmetry, as a function of decay time, between decay yields from mesons tagged as initially having $\overline{B}$ or $B$ flavour. Such images, for example for $B^0 \to J/\psi K^0_{\rm S}$ decays where the magnitude of the oscillation is proportional to $\sin(2\beta)$ with $\beta$ being an angle of the Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa Unitarity Triangle, provide a straightforward illustration of the underlying physics. Until now there has been no comparable method to provide visualisation for the case of decays to multibody final states that are not $CP$-eigenstates, where interference between $CP$-even and -odd amplitudes provides additional physics sensitivity. A method is proposed to weight the data so that the terms of interest can be projected out and used to obtain asymmetries that visualise the relevant effects. Application of the weighting to $B^0_s$ decays, where effects due to non-zero width difference are not negligible, provides a novel method to observe $CP$ violation in interference between mixing and decay without tagging the production flavour.</description>

      <title>Muon $g-2$ and Proton Lifetime in SUSY SU(5) GUTs with Split Superpartners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the interplay of the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the proton decay in the SUSY SU(5) GUTs with generation-independent scalar soft masses. In these scenarios, we introduce a number of $\bf 5+{\bar 5}$ messenger fields with doublet-triplet splitting in general gauge mediation to transmit SUSY breaking to the visible sector by gauge loops. As a result, squarks and sleptons receive generation-independent soft SUSY breaking masses, which are split already at the messenger scale. Taking into account the perturbative unification of gauge couplings as well as the bounds from electroweak precision and vacuum stability bounds, we showed the parameter space in general gauge mediation to explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly with smuon and sneutrino loops while evading the strong bounds on squarks and gluinos from the Large Hadron Collider. We also obtained the dominant Higgsino contributions to the proton decay mode, $p\to K^+{\bar\nu}$, with general generation-independent sparticle masses for squarks and sleptons. Even for split scalar soft masses in our model, however, we found that the bounds from the proton decay are satisfied only if the effective Yukawa couplings of the colored Higgsinos are suppressed further by a factor of order $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. We illustrated how such a suppression factor is realized in orbifold GUTs in the extra dimension where the colored Higgsinos in the bulk are not coupled to the matter fields localized at the orbifold fixed points at the leading order.</description>

      <title>Quantum Decoherence effects on precision measurements at DUNE and T2HK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential impact of neutrino quantum decoherence on the precision measurements of standard neutrino oscillation parameters in the DUNE and T2HK experiments. We show that the measurement of $\delta_\text{CP}$, $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ is stronger effected in DUNE than in T2HK. On the other hand, DUNE would have a better sensitivity than T2HK to observe decoherence effects. By performing a combined analysis of DUNE and T2HK we show that a robust measurement of standard parameters would be possible, which is not guaranteed with DUNE data alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-two-Maxwell holographic QCD model to investigate the dissociation effects of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$ states in an anisotropic medium by calculating their spectral functions. First, we present the holographic quarkonium masses at zero temperature via Physics-Informed Neural Networks. Then, at finite temperature, we derive the spectral functions, representing heavy vector mesons as peaks, and observe that with increasing anisotropy, temperature, chemical potential, and warp factor, the peak height diminishes while its width expands, indicating an accelerated dissociation process. Additionally, the results indicate the anisotropy induces a stronger dissociation effect in the direction parallel to the polarization compared to the perpendicular, revealing the anisotropy's directional influence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel minimal scenario which simultaneously addresses the following theoretical/cosmological/phenomenological puzzles: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Exact scale-symmetry was assumed. A global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-symmetry was also assumed but only in the matter sector. The novelty of the scenario is the introduction of an explicit $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-breaking term in the gravity sector only. Such a term does not disturb the axion solution whereas naturally realizes an axi-majoron hybrid inflation which allows a natural realization of Affleck-Dine mechanism for generating Peccei-Quinn number asymmetry. The asymmetry is transferred to the visible sector via the right-handed neutrino portal through non-thermal decay and/or thermal processes, even without the presence of a CP-violating phase in the matter sector. Dark matter and dark radiation are obtained by cold and hot components of axi-majorons, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In this study, 24.5 TeV CoM energy FCC-$\mu p$ and 20.2 TeV CoM energy SPPC-$\mu p$ muon-proton colliders have been utilized to explore the anomalous $ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma$ couplings corresponding to dim-8 operators through the process of $\mu^- \gamma \to Z l^{-} \to l^{-} \tilde{\nu_{l}} \nu_{l}$. A cut-based method has been applied to enhance the signal background ratio in the analysis. Coupling limits, at a 95\% Confidence Level (C.L.), under the systematic uncertainties of 0\%, 3\%, and 5\%, were obtained with luminosities of ${\cal L}_{int}=5$ and 42.8 fb$^{-1}$ for FCC-$\mu p$ and SPPC-$\mu p$ colliders, respectively. The limits for anomalous $C_{BB}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{\tilde{B}W}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{WW}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{BW}/\Lambda^{4}$ couplings without systematic uncertainty for FCC-$\mu p$ and SPPC-$\mu p$ were found as follows, respectively: [0.06845; 0.070019967] TeV-4, [-0.18662; 0.18422] TeV-4, [-0.23623; 0.23815] TeV-4, [-0.61912; 0.62072] TeV-4, and [-0.06606; 0.05050] TeV-4, [-0.15791; 0.15126] TeV-4, [-0.20663; 0.19155] TeV-4, [-0.51383; 0.52211] TeV-4.</description>

      <title>$T_7$ Flavor Symmetry gym: The Key to Unlocking the Neutrino Mass Puzzle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has indicated that the Standard Model (SM), while historically highly effective, is found to be insufficient due to its prediction of zero mass for neutrinos. With the exception of a few, the majority of the parameters related to neutrinos have been determined by neutrino oscillation experiments with excellent precision. Experiments on neutrino oscillation and neutrino mixing have shown that neutrinos are massive. To fill in gaps, discrete symmetries are becoming more common alongside continuous symmetries while describing the observed pattern of neutrino mixing. Here, we present a $T_7$ flavor symmetry to explain the masses of charged leptons and neutrinos. The light neutrino mass matrix is derived using seesaw mechanism of type I, which involves the Dirac neutrino mass matrix as well as the right-handed neutrino mass matrix. We estimate the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix ($U_{PMNS}$), three mixing angles, $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$ and $\theta_{13}$, which are strongly correlated with the recent experimental results. The extent of $CP$ violation in neutrino oscillations is obtained by calculating Jarskog invariant $(J_{CP})$ on the behalf of $U_{PMNS}$. We also find the masses of three neutrinos and Effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter $\langle m_{ee} \rangle$ which is $1.0960$ $meV$ and $10.9217$ $meV$ for normal and inverted hierarchy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Candidate Phases for SU(2) Adjoint QCD$_4$ with Two Flavors from $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.09592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study four-dimensional adjoint QCD with gauge group SU(2) and two Weyl fermion flavors, which has an $SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry. The infrared behavior of this theory is not firmly established. We explore candidate infrared phases by embedding adjoint QCD into $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory deformed by a supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M that preserves all global symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. This includes 't Hooft anomalies that are only visible when the theory is placed on manifolds that do not admit a spin structure. The consistency of this procedure is guaranteed by a nonabelian spin-charge relation involving the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry that is familiar from topologically twisted $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. Since every vacuum on the Coulomb branch of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory necessarily matches all 't Hooft anomalies, we can generate candidate phases for adjoint QCD by deforming the theories in these vacua while preserving all symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. One such deformation is the supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M itself, which can be reliably analyzed when M is small. In this regime it gives rise to an exotic Coulomb phase without chiral symmetry breaking. By contrast, the theory near the monopole and dyon points can be deformed to realize a candidate phase with monopole-induced confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The low-energy theory consists of two copies of a $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model, which we analyze in detail. Certain topological couplings that are likely to be present in this $\mathbb{CP}^1$ model turn the confining solitonic string of the model into a topological insulator. We also examine the behavior of various candidate phases under fermion mass deformations. We speculate on the possible large-M behavior of the deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory and conjecture that the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase eventually becomes dominant.</description>

Abstract: The shortest distance around the Universe through us is unlikely to be much larger than the horizon diameter if microwave background anomalies are due to cosmic topology. We show that observational constraints from the lack of matched temperature circles in the microwave background leave many possibilities for such topologies. We evaluate the detectability of microwave background multipole correlations for sample cases. Searches for topology signatures in observational data over the large space of possible topologies pose a formidable computational challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fayet-Iliopoulos $D$-term is a common feature in $\mathcal{N}=1$ string vacua that contain an anomalous $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and arises from a one--loop diagram in string perturbation theory. The same diagram is generated in string vacua in which supersymmetry is broken directly at the string scale, either via spontaneous Scherk-Schwarz breaking, in which case the gravitino mass is determined by the radius of the circle used in the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism, or via explicit supersymmetry breaking by the GSO projections. We analyse the resulting would-be Fayet-Illiopoulos $D$-term in the non-supersymmetric string vacua and its contribution to the vacuum energy. A numerical estimate in an explicit tachyon-free string-derived model suggests that the would-be $D$-term contribution may uplift the vacuum energy to a positive value.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological models with inflation and those with bounce have their own strengths and weaknesses. Here we construct a model in which a phase of bounce is followed by a viable inflationary phase. This incorporates several advantages of both and hence, is a more viable model for cosmic evolution. We explore scenarios wherein the bouncing phase smoothly transits to an inflationary one, with the pivot scale leaving the Hubble horizon during the latter era, thereby maintaining consistency with observations. Staying within the ambit of Einstein-Hilbert gravity augmented by the inflaton, we ensure a pre-inflationary bounce by introducing a second scalar field that helps engineer the requisite violation of the null energy condition. Potential ghost instabilities can be mitigated by invoking a non-trivial coupling between the two scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating quarks and hadronic systems, produced in peripheral heavy ion collisions, can experience Coriolis force and other forces due to rotational motion. Considering only the effect of Coriolis force, we have calculated the electrical conductivity for non-relativistic rotating matter using the Relaxation Time Approximation based Boltzmann transport equation. A similarity in mathematical calculations of electrical conductivity at finite rotation and finite magnetic fields is exposed, where an equivalence role between Coriolis force on massive particle's motion and Lorentz force on charged particle's motion is noticed. As the beginning level step, we consider only the Coriolis force in the non-relativistic formalism, which will be extended in the future towards the relativistic case, and to adopt other forces for a more realistic description of the rotating quark and hadronic system.</description>

      <title>Linear Boltzmann transport for jet propagation in the quark-gluon plasma: Inelastic processes and jet modification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Monte Carlo model has been developed to describe jet propagation and interaction with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A complete set of elastic scattering processes and medium-induced gluon emissions based on the higher-twist formalism are incorporated for both jet shower and medium recoil partons. It has been employed to describe experimental data on large transverse momentum hadron and jet spectra, correlation and jet substructures in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We document in detail the structure of the model and validation of the Monte Carlo implementations of the physics processes in LBT, in particular, the inelastic process of medium-induced gluon radiation. We carry out a comprehensive examination of the jet-medium interaction as implemented in LBT through energy loss and momentum broadening of a single hard parton, the energy and transverse momentum transfer from leading partons to medium-induced gluons and jet-induced medium excitation, and medium modification of reconstructed jets in a static and uniform medium. With realistic and event-by-event hydrodynamic medium in heavy-ion collisions, we compute and compare to experimental data on the jet cone-size dependence of the single inclusive jet suppression at both Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the dijet asymmetry at LHC and $\gamma$-jet correlation at RHIC. Effects of medium-induced gluon emissions and jet-induced medium excitation on jet observables are systematically examined. Rescatterings of the radiated gluons and recoil partons with the QGP are found essential to account for the enhancement of soft particle yield toward the edge of the jet cone.</description>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey recent developments in a novel kind of generalized global symmetry, the non-invertible symmetry, in diverse spacetime dimensions. We start with several different but related constructions of the non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry in the Ising model, and conclude with a new interpretation for the neutral pion decay and other applications. These notes are based on lectures given at the TASI 2023 summer school "Aspects of Symmetry."</description>

      <title>Analytical structure of the binary collision integral and the ultrarelativistic limit of transport coefficients of an ideal gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the analytical properties of the binary collision integral for a gas of ultrarelativistic particles interacting via a constant cross-section. Starting from a near-equilibrium expansion over a complete basis of irreducible tensors in momentum space we compute the linearized collision matrices analytically. Using these results we then numerically compute all transport-coefficients of relativistic fluid dynamics with various power-counting schemes that are second-order in Knudsen and/or inverse Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, we also exactly compute the leading-order contribution with respect to the particle mass to the coefficient of bulk viscosity, the relaxation time, and other second-order transport coefficients of the bulk viscous pressure.</description>

      <title>Inflationary models constrained by reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of reheating in inflationary models is crucial for understanding the early universe and gaining insights into inflationary dynamics and parameters. The reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the duration of the reheating phase, quantified by the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, have significant implications for particle production, thermalization, and the primordial power spectrum. The duration of reheating affects particle abundance, including dark matter, and shapes the primordial power spectrum and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. By combining cosmological observations and theoretical considerations, we can constrain both $T_{re}$ and $N_{re}$, which in turn constrain the spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and inflation model parameters. Utilizing consistency relations among observables, such as $n_s$ and $r$, provides additional constraints on inflationary models and determines bounds for other observables like the running of the scalar spectral index. These bounds are valuable for assessing the viability of models and can serve to specify priors in Bayesian analyses of specific models. As an example of how to proceed, we study in detail a particular case of a generalized $\alpha$-attractor model that accurately reproduces observed quantities. We present equations for the conditions of instantaneous reheating, establish consistency relations, and explore the generalized $\alpha$-attractor model using cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Fast neutrino-flavor swap in high-energy astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assert that non-linear features of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) can be qualitatively different between core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). This argument arises from recent global FFC simulations in BNSM, in which fast flavor swap (FFS) emerges in very narrow spatial regions, whereas neutrinos in CCSN tend to evolve towards flavor equipartition. In this {\it Letter}, we provide the physical mechanism of FFS based on a colliding neutrino beam model. Neutrinos/antineutrinos can undergo FFS when they propagate in ambient neutrino gas that propagates in the opposite direction and also has the opposite sign of ELN-XLN, where ELN and XLN denote electron- and heavy-leptonic neutrino number, respectively. Such environments can be naturally realized in BNSMs, whereas they are unlikely in CCSNe unless the neutrino sphere is strongly deformed aspherically. Our study exhibits the diversity of non-linear dynamics of FFC.</description>

      <title>The resonant history of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Universality of pseudo-Goldstone damping near critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, in studies of holographic models and hydrodynamics with spontaneous breaking of approximate symmetries, it has been proposed that the damping of pseudo-Goldstone modes at finite temperatures is universally constrained in the way that $\Omega_{\varphi}/m_{\varphi}^2\simeq D_{\varphi}$ in the broken phase, where $\Omega_{\varphi}$ and $m_{\varphi} $ are the relaxation rate at zero wavenumber and the mass of pseudo-Goldstones, $D_{\varphi}$ is the Goldstone diffusivity in the limit of purely spontaneous breaking. In this paper, we investigate the pseudo-Goldstone damping in a purely relaxational O($N$) model by performing the functional renormalization group calculations at the full quantum and stochastic level within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We find that, away from the critical temperature, the proposed relation is always valid. When the temperature is very close to the critical value such that the mass of the Higgs mode is comparable to the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone modes, the pseudo-Goldstone damping displays a novel scaling behavior that follows $\Omega_\varphi/m_\varphi^2\propto m_{\varphi}^{\Delta_\eta}$ with a correction $\Delta_\eta$ controlled by the critical universalities. Moreover, we study how the correction depends on the value of $N$ and show that $\Delta_\eta \rightarrow 0$ when fluctuations are infinitely suppressed in the large $N$ limit. In this case, the proposed relation works even in the critical region. Finally, we match our results to the dissipative sector of the pion dynamics near the chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>Bjorken and threshold asymptotics of a space-like structure function in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a coordinate space structure function ${\cal E}(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to the next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. We analytically perform the twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin representations. Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions are naturally generated in their Borel representations with detailed enumerations and explicit expressions provided to all powers. The renormalon cancellation at $t=n$ between the hard functions at powers $p$ and the non-perturbative functions at powers $p+n$ are explicitly verified, and the issue of ``scale-dependency'' of the perturbative and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. Simple expressions for the leading power non-perturbative functions are also provided both in the coordinate space and the momentum-fraction space ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) with ``zero-mode-type'' subtractions at $\alpha=0$ discussed in detail. In addition to the Bjorken limit, we also perform the threshold expansion of the structure function up to the next-to-next-to-leading threshold power exactly and investigate the resurgence relation between threshold and ``Regge'' asymptotics. We also prove that the twist expansion is absolutely convergent for any $0&lt;z^2&lt;\infty$ and any $ \lambda \in iR_{\ge 0}$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>
