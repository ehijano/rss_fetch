      <title>Surface activation of Hastalex by vacuum argon plasma for cytocompatibility enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present surface analysis and biocompatibility evaluation of novel composite material based on graphene oxide traded as Hastalex. First, the surface morphology and elemental analysis of the pristine material were examined by atomic force and scanning electron microscopies, and by energy-dispersive and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, respectively. The Hastalex surface was then modified by plasma, 3 and 8 W with exposure times up to 240 s, the impact of which on the material surface wettability and morphology was further evaluated. In addition, the material aging was studied at room and elevated temperatures. Significant changes in surface roughness, morphology, and area were detected at the nanometre scale after plasma exposure. An increase in oxygen content due to the plasma exposure was observed both for 3 and 8 W. The plasma treatment had an outstanding effect on the cytocompatibility of Hastalex foil treated at both input powers of 3 and 8 W. The cell number of human MRC 5 fibroblasts on Hastalex foils exposed to plasma increased significantly compared to pristine Hastalex and even to tissue culture polystyrene. The plasma exposure also affected the fibroblasts cell growth and shape.</description>

      <title>Porous aluminium decorated with rhodium nanoparticles, preparation and use as platform for UV plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a high current interest for novel plasmonic platforms and materials able to extend their applicability into the ultraviolet (UV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the UV it is possible to explore spectral properties of biomolecules with small cross section in the visible spectral range. However, most used metals in plasmonics have their resonances at wavelengths &gt; 350 nm. Aluminum and rhodium are two interesting candidate materials for UV plasmonics, and in this work we developed a simple and low-cost preparation of functional substrates based on nanoporous aluminum decorated with rhodium nanoparticles. We demonstrate that these functionalized nanoporous metal films can be exploited as plasmonic materials suitable for enhanced UV Raman spectroscopy</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body approach for near-field radiative heat transfer between nonspherical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized fluctuational electrodynamics-based many-body approach for calculating near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between nonspherical dipoles is proposed. The geometric parameters of nonspherical dipoles are implemented in the definition of the self-term of the free-space Green's function and, conversely to previous many-body models of NFRHT, dipole polarizability is defined a posteriori from the free-space Green's function solution such that polarizability calculation is an optional post-processing step rather than a required input. Both strong and weak forms of the generalized many-body approach are presented. It is shown that the approximate weak form is less computationally expensive but is only applicable to small particles characterized by size parameters less than ~0.24. The generalized many-body method is compared against an analytical solution for NFRHT between two spheroidal dipoles. Acceptable agreement is obtained, and the discrepancies are ascribed to differences in approximations for multiple reflections and from the way in which particle orientation is implemented in each method. The generalized many-body method is then applied to analyze the near-field spectral conductance between two SiC ellipsoidal dipoles. Results reveal that changes in the orientation of one of the ellipsoidal dipoles lead to active tuning of localized surface phonon resonance by up to three orders of magnitude. Finally, the spectral radiative thermal conductivity of a metamaterial composed of 1000 SiO2 ellipsoidal particles is studied. The metamaterial displays anisotropic radiative thermal conductivity, with differences in the value at resonance up to 2.8 times between different directions. The generalized many-body model of NFRHT presented in this paper may be used to develop particle-based metamaterials with novel, engineered radiative thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-driven creation of magnetic topological structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present research, we demonstrate the usage of plasmonic effects in thin film structures to control magnetic topological textures, specifically skyrmions and skyrmioniums. We investigate numerically the generation and alteration of these topological structures caused by hemisphere gold nanoparticle placed over a magnetic layer coated with a dielectric material. The electromagnetic and photothermal models are used to clarify the processes of producing heat and absorption, and the results were implemented in micromagnetic formalism to reveal the dynamics of magnetization under various conditions. Our findings demonstrate the significance of the laser pulse duration and the contact area between nanoparticles and the underlying magnetic layer in forming topological textures. In particular, we show how to generate a single skyrmion, multiple skyrmions, and skyrmioniums, and how to dynamically transition between these states. These results highlight the possibility of manipulating magnetic textures by using plasmonic effects, which presents significant opportunities for spintronics and non-conventional computer applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Elevated Temperature Galling in Hardfacings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galling mechanism of Tristelle 5183, an Fe-based hardfacing alloy, was investigated at elevated temperature. The test was performed using a bespoke galling rig. Adhesive transfer and galling were found to occur, as a result of shear at the adhesion boundary and the activation of an internal shear plane within one of the tribosurfaces. During deformation, carbides were observed to have fractured, as a result of the shear train they were exposed to and their lack of ductility. In the case of niobium carbides, their fracture resulted in the formation of voids, which were found to coalesce and led to cracking and adhesive transfer. A tribologically affected zone (TAZ) was found to form, which contained nanocrystalline austenite, as a result of the shear exerted within 30{\mu}m of the adhesion boundaries. The galling of Tristelle 5183 initiated from the formation of an adhesive boundary, followed by sub-surface shear in only one tribosurface, Following further sub-surface shear, an internal shear plane is activated. internal shear and shear at the adhesion boundary continues until fracture occur, resulting in adhesive transfer.</description>

      <title>Electrically Programmable Pixelated Graphene-Integrated Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Coherent Mid-Infrared Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces have recently emerged as compact, lightweight, and efficient platforms for dynamic control of electromagnetic fields and optical responses. However, the complexities associated with their post-fabrication tunability significantly hinder their widespread applications, especially for the mid-infrared range due to material scarcity and design intricacy. Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly dynamic, pixelated modulations of coherent mid-infrared emission based on an electrically programmable plasmonic metasurface integrated with graphene field effect transistors (Gr-FETs). The ultrabroad infrared transparency of graphene allows for free-form control over plasmonic meta-atoms, thus achieving coherent mid-infrared states across a broad range of wavelengths and polarizations. The spatial temperature modulation generated by Gr-FETs is effectively synergized with the emissivity control by the localized surface plasmon polaritons from gold nanoantennas. This integrated temperature-emissivity modulation of metasurfaces is systematically extended to form a pixelated 2D array, envisioning new approaches toward scalable 2D electrical wiring for densely packed, independently controlled pixels.</description>

      <title>Si Metasurface Supporting Multiple Quasi-BICs for Degenerate Four-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) enable high field enhancement with narrow-linewidth resonances in the visible and near-infrared ranges. The resonance emerges when distorting the meta-atom's geometry away from a symmetry-protected BIC condition and, usually, a given design can sustain one or two of these states. In this work, we introduce a silicon-on-silica metasurface that simultaneously supports up to four qBIC resonances in the near-infrared region. This is achieved by combining multiple symmetry-breaking distortions on an elliptical cylinder array. By pumping two of these resonances, the nonlinear process of degenerate four-wave mixing is experimentally realized. By comparing the nonlinear response with that of an unpatterned silicon film, the near-field enhancement inside the nanostructured dielectric is revealed. The presented results demonstrate independent geometric control of multiple qBICs and their interaction trough wave mixing processes, opening new research pathways in nanophotonics, with potential applications in information multiplexing, multi-wavelength sensing and nonlinear imaging.</description>

      <title>Holistic numerical simulation of a quenching process on a real-size multifilamentary superconducting coil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors play a crucial role in the advancement of high-field electromagnets. Unfortunately, their performance can be compromised by thermomagnetic instabilities, wherein the interplay of rapid magnetic and slow heat diffusion can result in catastrophic flux jumps eventually leading to irreversible damage. This issue has long plagued high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn wires at the core of high-field magnets. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm aimed at tackling the complex intertwined effects of electromagnetism, heating, and strain acting concomitantly during the quenching process of superconducting coils. We validate our model by conducting comparisons with magnetization measurements obtained from short multifilamentary Nb$_3$Sn wires and further experimental tests conducted on solenoid coils while subject to ramping transport currents. Furthermore, leveraging our developed numerical algorithm, we unveil the dynamic propagation mechanisms underlying thermomagnetic instabilities (including flux jumps and quenches) within the coils. Remarkably, our findings reveal that the velocity field of flux jumps and quenches within the coil is correlated with the amount of Joule heating experienced by each wire over a specific time interval, rather than solely being dependent on instantaneous Joule heating or maximum temperature. These insights have the potential to pave the way for optimizing the design of next-generation superconducting magnets, thereby directly influencing a wide array of technologically relevant and multidisciplinary applications.</description>

      <title>Focusing Surface Acoustic Waves with a Plasmonic Hypersonic Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas have proven to be efficient transducers of electromagnetic to mechanical energy and vice versa. The sudden thermal expansion of these structures after an ultrafast optical pulsed excitation leads to the emission of hypersonic acoustic waves to the supporting substrate, which can be detected by another antenna that acts as a high-sensitive mechanical probe due to the strong modulation of its optical response. Sophisticated fabrication techniques, together with the implementation of numerical simulations, have allowed the engineering of nanostructures for the controlled directional generation and detection of high-frequency acoustic phonons at the nanoscale, with many potential applications in telecommunications, sensing, mechanical switching, and energy transport. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a nanoscale acoustic lens comprised of 11 gold nanodisks whose collective oscillation gives rise to an interference pattern that results in a diffraction-limited surface acoustic beam of about 340 nm width, with an amplitude contrast of 60%. Via spatially decoupled pump-probe experiments, we were able to map the radiated acoustic energy in the proximity of the focal area, obtaining a very good agreement with the continuum elastic theory.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a detailed computational framework designed to analyze and forecast the complex multiphase characteristics of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are essential for developing sustainable technological advancements. Lead-free piezoelectric materials have a significant thermo-electromechanical response, although their electromechanical characteristics vary throughout different phases of the material. Lead-free piezoelectric materials undergo phase changes, including rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases, when the temperature changes. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Furthermore, multiple phases exist simultaneously under certain temperature, electrical, and mechanical conditions, resulting in the material displaying intricate multiphase behavior. Studying such behaviour is crucial for evaluating the performance of these materials. The computational approach in this research relies on Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to model micro-domain phase changes in the material. This research will enhance our comprehension of the significance of complex multiphase behaviour in creating environment-friendly and sustainable technological solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion control of droplets has generated much attention for its applications to microfluidics, where precise control of small fluid volumes is an imperative requirement. Mechanical vibrations have been shown to be effective at inducing controllable depinning, and activation of different drop motion regimes. However, existing vibration-based strategies involve establishing homogeneous rigid-body dynamics on the substrate, and therefore lack any form of spatial heterogeneity and tuning. Addressing this limitation, metamaterials provide an ideal platform to achieve spectrally and spatially selective drop motion control, which leverages their ability to attenuate vibrations in selected frequency bands and in selected regions of a substrate. In this work, we illustrate the potential of metamaterials-based drop control by experimentally demonstrating a variety of drop motion capabilities on the surface of metaplates endowed with locally resonant stubs. The experiments leverage the design versatility of a LEGO component-enabled reconfigurable design platform and laser vibrometry measurements with high spatial resolution.</description>

Abstract: We report on the realization of ultrasensitive absolute pressure sensors based on silicon nitride membrane sandwiches. These sandwiches consist in a pair of highly-pretensioned, ultrathin (50 nm), large area (0.25 mm2) films, suspended parallel to each other and forming an ultrashort (500 nm), open cavity. The compression of a gas in this cavity leads to a strong squeeze film force, resulting in an increase in the membrane mechanical resonance frequencies which is directly proportional to the absolute gas pressure. These sandwiches show a record high responsitivity of &gt;300 Hz/Pa in terms of squeeze film-induced frequency shift, which, combined with high quality factor mechanical resonances (Q&gt;10^6), allows for bringing the sensitivity of absolute squeeze film pressure sensors down to the sub-millipascal level.</description>

Abstract: Urn models for innovation have proven to capture fundamental empirical laws shared by several real-world processes. The so-called urn model with triggering includes, as particular cases, an urn representation of the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process and the Dirichlet process, seminal in Bayesian non-parametric inference. In this work, we leverage this connection to introduce a novel approach for quantifying closeness between symbolic sequences and test it within the framework of the authorship attribution problem. The method demonstrates high accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in different scenarios, featuring a substantial gain in computational efficiency and theoretical transparency. Beyond the practical convenience, this work demonstrates how the recently established connection between urn models and non-parametric Bayesian inference can pave the way for designing more efficient inference methods. In particular, the hybrid approach that we propose allows us to relax the exchangeability hypothesis, which can be particularly relevant for systems exhibiting complex correlation patterns and non-stationary dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Superionic conductors, or solid-state ion-conductors surpassing 0.01 S/cm in conductivity, can enable more energy dense batteries, robust artificial ion pumps, and optimized fuel cells. However, tailoring superionic conductors require precise knowledge of ion migration mechanisms that are still not well understood, due to limitations set by available spectroscopic tools. Most spectroscopic techniques do not probe ion hopping at its inherent picosecond timescale, nor the many-body correlations between the migrating ions, lattice vibrational modes, and charge screening clouds--all of which are posited to greatly enhance ionic conduction. Here, we develop an ultrafast technique that measures the time-resolved change in impedance upon light excitation which triggers selective ion-coupled correlations. We also develop a cost-effective, non-time-resolved laser-driven impedance method that is more accessible for lab-scale adoption. We use both techniques to compare the relative changes in impedance of a solid-state Li+ conductor Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO) before and after UV to THz frequency excitations to elucidate the corresponding ion-many-body-interaction correlations. From our techniques, we determine that electronic screening and phonon-mode interactions dominate the ion migration pathway of LLTO. Although we only present one case study, our technique can extend to O2-, H+, or other charge carrier transport phenomena where ultrafast correlations control transport. Furthermore, the temporal relaxation of the measured impedance can distinguish ion transport effects caused by many-body correlations, optical heating, correlation, and memory behavior.</description>
