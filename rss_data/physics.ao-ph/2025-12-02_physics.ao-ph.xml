      <title>Tropopause Detection and Analysis in the Mid Latitude Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an advanced framework for tropopause detection and analysis using ERA5 reanalysis data, with particular application to extreme meteorological events affecting Morocco and Southern Europe. The research implements and compares multiple detection methodologies, including classical approaches (thermal/WMO and dynamical/1.5 PVU criteria) alongside novel hybrid techniques combining stability and humidity parameters originally developed by ECMWF. Through systematic validation against January 2010 monthly means and a detailed case study of the October 2024 DANA (Depression Aislada en Niveles Altos) event, this work demonstrates the superior performance of hybrid approaches in capturing tropopause dynamics. The development of an automated Python-based comparison tool enabled a quantitative evaluation against Water Vapor 6.2 {\mu}m satellite imagery, revealing that the hybrid method achieved the highest structural similarity (mean SSIM: 0.5327) and the most consistent performance across the studied meteorological conditions. The findings highlight the critical role of accurate tropopause detection in improving forecasting capabilities for extreme weather events, particularly in topographically complex regions like Southeast Morocco. This research contributes both methodological advancements in tropopause identification and practical insights for operational meteorology, providing a foundation for enhanced early warning systems and improved understanding of atmospheric processes governing high-impact weather phenomena.</description>

      <title>Snow cover over the Iberian mountains in km-scale global climate simulations: evaluation and projected changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mountains represent a crucial natural resource for many regions worldwide, particularly in Mediterranean areas such as the Iberian Peninsula, where climate change can have profound consequences. However, due to their coarse resolution, traditional climate models cannot properly represent the complexity of orographic processes. Storm-resolving models, with horizontal resolutions finer than 10 km, offer a path forward to provide high-quality information for local adaptation even in complex terrain. In this work, we assess the performance of one such model, the IFS-FESOM developed within the EU-NextGEMS project, in simulating the historical seasonal snow cover in the main Iberian mountain ranges and projecting climate change effects. It is evaluated against four high-resolution reanalysis-based products, satellite, and in situ observations. Despite a positive bias in the length of the snow cover season and the number of snowfall days, the model can represent features of the snow climatology, such as its elevation dependency, seasonal cycle, and mean covered area, successfully within the range of uncertainty of the reference data. In addition, the projection under the SSP3-7.0 scenario shows a marked reduction of the snow season across almost all of Iberia, with low- to mid-elevations and the southernmost ranges showing the greatest reductions. These changes are linked to reduced snowfall days, caused primarily by rising temperatures but also by decreasing precipitation, particularly in southern and Mediterranean sectors. Our results suggest that storm-resolving simulations can provide local climate projections of snow information in complex terrain without regional downscaling.</description>

      <title>Buoy observation of high frequency ocean wave energy: accuracy, consistency, and concerns for predictive applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational data from buoys are of primary importance during the development, calibration, and evaluation of ocean wave models, and these data are also used to make real-time corrections to operational models via data assimilation. By association, systematic inaccuracies in any buoy data are equally important, and thus when two buoy types provide systematically inconsistent information, this is a concern for anyone using an ocean wave model. This report is concerned with the accuracy of the high frequency portion of the ocean wave spectrum commonly observable by buoys, roughly 0.2 to 0.6 Hz. We evaluate four buoy types (two moored, two drifting) using two quantitative measures. The first involves comparing each type with a co-located ocean wave model. The second method involves evaluation of high frequency energy level as a function of wind speed. Both evaluation methods suggest that the Datawell Waverider (DWR) buoys have a strong tendency to report higher energy levels than the other three buoy types. We evaluate high frequency energy level using three different metrics (mean square slope, energy in a band of high frequencies, and spectral density at a single, specific band, 0.4 Hz), and the conclusions are found to be insensitive to the parameter used.</description>

      <title>DAISI: Data Assimilation with Inverse Sampling using Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations and heuristic tuning (e.g., inflation and localization) to scale to high dimensions. While often successful, these approximations can make the methods unstable or inaccurate when the underlying distributions of states and observations depart significantly from Gaussianity. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior to assimilate observations via guidance-based conditional sampling while incorporating forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step. This step maps the forecast ensemble into a latent space to provide initial conditions for the conditional sampling, allowing us to encode model dynamics into the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.</description>

      <title>Cold pools, Breezes, and Monsoons: Propagating Convection over New Guinea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diurnal cycle of precipitation near New Guinea involves intricate land-ocean-atmosphere interactions, posing substantial challenges for tropical weather and climate simulations. Using over two decades of GPM satellite observations and convection-permitting WRF simulations, this study examines the physical mechanisms governing the pronounced offshore propagation of diurnal convection over New Guinea. We identify two distinct convective propagation modes: (1) a "ridge-to-coast" mode originated over elevated terrain and migrating toward the coastline, and (2) an "over-ocean" mode initiated near the coast, separated by a spatial gap of approximately 100 km. Our findings highlight the critical role of multi-scale density currents in shaping boundary layer dynamics over warm ocean waters. Specifically, the afternoon sea-breeze front advects cooler air onshore, stabilizing the lower atmosphere and interrupting the continuous propagation of the first mode. At night, the hybrid land breeze, enriched by cold pools, generates offshore moist patches that facilitate the convective regeneration and propagation of the second mode. These offshore convective systems interact with monsoonal background winds, sustaining precipitation well beyond 200-600 km from the coast. Sensitivity experiments indicate that even a modest increase in sea surface temperature can enhance convective intensity and extend offshore propagation. These results shed light on the mechanisms that enable diurnal offshore convection to persist overnight and propagate far from the coastline, highlighting the importance of moist-boundary-layer density currents and offering insights for improving precipitation forecasts and global model performance over the Maritime Continent.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing the Frontier: Advancing Hybrid Physics-ML Climate Simulation via a $50,000 Kaggle Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.</description>

      <title>Capturing methane in a barn environment: the CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CH4 Livestock Emission (CH4rLiE) project explores the development of a prototype system for capturing methane emissions in barn environments, offering an alternative approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming. Methane (CH4), with a global warming potential significantly higher than CO2 (GWP100 = 27), accounts for ~23% of anthropogenic climate impact. In 2021, The Assessment Report 6 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change quantified CH4 livestock emissions in 123 Mt/yr, which, together with substantial N2O and CO2 emissions, contributed with a 12% to global emissions. Unlike strategies focused on altering animal feed, CH4rLiE investigates post-emission capture using porous materials, such as zeolites, to adsorb methane from barn air. The project draws on CERN's experience with gas recovery systems for particle detectors, adapting similar technologies to agricultural settings. Preliminary estimates, based on measured CH4 concentrations (~20 mg/m3) and partial air filtration in a 250-animal barn, suggest a low but detectable recovery potential, subject to validation through simulation and in-situ testing. Prototype development considers the potential for energy-efficient operation - possibly through pressure swing regeneration - and compatibility with existing ventilation infrastructure, though these aspects remain under evaluation. If methane concentrations in barns prove too diluted, the system may be better suited for environments with higher gas levels, such as pigsties or landfills. NH3 capture for fertilizer production is planned as a future enhancement. CH4rLiE aims to assess the feasibility of emission recovery in livestock settings without affecting animal welfare, contributing to sustainable farming practices, resource efficiency, and circular bioeconomy goals.</description>

      <title>Guided Unconditional and Conditional Generative Models for Super-Resolution and Inference of Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of Earth systems are coarse, and Earth observations are sparse and gappy. We apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. Two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider multiple test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantifications of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that the generated super-resolution fields of SDEdit are unphysical, while those of DPS are reasonable but with smoothed fine-scale features; however, neither of these lower-cost models propagates observational information effectively to unobserved regions. The two conditional models require re-training, but reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and predict correct turbulence statistics, including the tails. Further, their mean errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the tradeoffs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment.</description>
