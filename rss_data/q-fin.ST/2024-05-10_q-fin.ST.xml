      <title>High-Frequency Stock Market Order Transitions during the US-China Trade War 2018: A Discrete-Time Markov Chain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of high-frequency stock market order transaction data is conducted to understand order transition dynamics. We employ a first-order time-homogeneous discrete-time Markov chain model to the sequence of orders of stocks belonging to six different sectors during the USA-China trade war of 2018. The Markov property of the order sequence is validated by the Chi-square test. We estimate the transition probability matrix of the sequence using maximum likelihood estimation. From the heat-map of these matrices, we found the presence of active participation by different types of traders during high volatility days. On such days, these traders place limit orders primarily with the intention of deleting the majority of them to influence the market. These findings are supported by high stationary distribution and low mean recurrence values of add and delete orders. Further, we found similar spectral gap and entropy rate values, which indicates that similar trading strategies are employed on both high and low volatility days during the trade war. Among all the sectors considered in this study, we observe that there is a recurring pattern of full execution orders in Finance &amp; Banking sector. This shows that the banking stocks are resilient during the trade war. Hence, this study may be useful in understanding stock market order dynamics and devise trading strategies accordingly on high and low volatility days during extreme macroeconomic events.</description>

      <title>Complex network analysis of cryptocurrency market during crashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies the cryptocurrency market crashes and analyses its dynamics using the complex network. We identify three distinct crashes during 2017-20, and the analysis is carried out by dividing the time series into pre-crash, crash, and post-crash periods. Partial correlation based complex network analysis is carried out to study the crashes. Degree density ($\rho_D$), average path length ($\bar{l}$), and average clustering coefficient ($\overline{cc}$) are estimated from these networks. We find that both $\rho_D$ and $\overline{cc}$ are smallest during the pre-crash period, and spike during the crash suggesting the network is dense during a crash. Although $\rho_D$ and $\overline{cc}$ decrease in the post-crash period, they remain higher than pre-crash levels for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 crashes suggesting a market attempt to return to normalcy. We get $\bar{l}$ is minimal during the crash period, suggesting a rapid flow of information. A dense network and rapid information flow suggest that during a crash uninformed synchronized panic sell-off happens. However, during the 2019-20 crash, the values of $\rho_D$, $\overline{cc}$, and $\bar{l}$ did not vary significantly, indicating minimal change in dynamics compared to other crashes. The findings of this study may guide investors in making decisions during market crashes.</description>
