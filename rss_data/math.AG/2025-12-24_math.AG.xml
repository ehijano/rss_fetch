      <title>Finite subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ arising from configurations of skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3_K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite groups arising from configurations of skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3_K$. Given a finite set ${L}$ of pairwise skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3_K$ and the associated groupoid $C_{L}$, we consider the endomorphism group $G_{L} \subset \operatorname{Aut}(L_i) \cong \operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ for any line $L_i \in {L}$, and we ask which finite subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ can occur in this way.
  Using a matrix description of skew lines, we express the generators of $G_{L}$ in terms of a family of matrices $M_i \in \operatorname{GL}_2(K)$ and analyze $G_{L}$ in the abelian and non-abelian cases. In the abelian situation we show that, after a change of basis, the matrices $M_i$ are simultaneously upper triangular and we obtain explicit families realizing cyclic groups and $p$-semi-elementary groups of the form $C_p^m \rtimes C_n$. In the non-abelian case we prove that no dihedral group $D_n$ with $n \ge 3$ can occur, while we construct configurations with $G_{L} \cong A_4, S_4, A_5$ and describe their orbit structure.
  Viewed through the lens of $(a,b)$-geproci sets, these results provide a group-theoretic description of collinearly complete point sets and yield new examples of half-grid geproci sets.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Koszul Cohomology of Canonical Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the representation-theoretic structure of the Koszul cohomology of a smooth projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, admitting an action of a finite group $G$ of order coprime to ${\rm char}(k)$. Properties of $G$-equivariant functors are employed to show that the associated Koszul complex is a complex of $kG$-modules, and to generalize known dimension formulas to identities between virtual representations. In the case of canonical curves, explicit formulas are obtained by combining the theory of equivariant Euler characteristics and equivariant Riemann-Roch theorems with that of generating functions for Schur functors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct semiorthogonal decompositions of moduli of principal bundles on a curve into its symmetric powers, for both the moduli stack of all $G$-bundles and the coarse moduli space of semistable $G$-bundles. The essential ingredients in the proof include Borel-Weil-Bott theory for loop groups, highest weight structure of current group representation, derived $\Theta$-stratification and local-global compatibility of Kac-Moody localization.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Dieudonn\'e theory and overconvergent extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the proof of Crew's parabolicity conjecture, we established a key property concerning the slopes of $\dagger$-hulls of $F$-isocrystals, extending a result of Tsuzuki. This article presents an alternative proof of this theorem for a specific class of $F$-isocrystals. The central ingredient is a local extension property for \'etale $p$-divisible subgroups. To relate $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, we employ logarithmic Dieudonn\'e theory, as introduced by Kato and further developed by Inoue. Over curves, this leads to an equivalence between the category of potentially semi-stable $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals with slopes in the interval $[0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Weak Fano threefolds arising as the blowup of a hyperquadric in $\mathbb{P}^4$ along a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize smooth irreducible curves $C$ on a smooth hyperquadric $Y$ of $\mathbb{P}^4$ such that the blowup of $Y$ along $C$ is a weak Fano threefold. These are precisely the smooth irreducible curves $C$ of degree $d$ and genus $g$ lying on a smooth hypercubic section of $Y$ such that (i) $C$ has no 4-secant line and no 7-secant conic; (ii) $d&lt; 18$ and $(g,d)\not \in \{(4,7),\:(10, 11)\}$; (iii) either $3d-26&lt;g\leq\frac{d^2-1}{12}$ or $(g,d)\in \{(4,6),\:(13,12)\}$. We prove the geometric realizability of each case, thereby proving the existence of weak Fano threefolds and Sarkisov links constructed from them, which were previously known only as numerical possibilities.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and fundamental groups of complex quasi-projective varieties (III): applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is Part III of a series of three. We begin by introducing the notion of $h$-special varieties, which can be seen as varieties "chain-connected by the Zariski closures of entire curves." We prove that if $X$ is either a special complex quasi-projective variety in the sense of Campana or an $h$-special variety, then for any linear representation $\varrho:\pi_1(X)\to \mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$, the image $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is virtually nilpotent. We also provide examples showing that this result is sharp, leading to a revised form of Campana's abelianity conjecture for smooth quasi-projective varieties. In addition, we prove a structure theorem for quasi-projective varieties with big and semisimple representations of the fundamental groups, thereby addressing a conjecture by Koll\'ar in 1995. We also construct several examples of quasi-projective varieties that are special and $h$-special, highlighting certain atypical properties of the non-compact case in contrast with the projective setting.</description>

      <title>An Arithmetic Topology viewpoint on Descent theory and Equivariant Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified group-theoretic framework bridging the arithmetic homotopy exact sequence of a variety and the Birman exact sequence of a surface. Within this framework, we reinterpret classical arithmetic notions - such as the descent of varieties and of covers - and construct their topological analogues. We formalize the parallel setting between closed subgroups of the absolute Galois group and subgroups of the Mapping Class Group of a base space and their actions on fundamental groups. This provides an analogy between arithmetic and topological invariants, allowing us to define the groups of moduli, definition, and invariance in both settings.
  Using this unified perspective, some purely group-theoretic proofs provide results in both settings simultaneously. Applications include a topological analogue of Weil's Descent Theorem for mapping class groups and an adaptation of D\'ebes and Douai's cohomological obstructions regarding descent of algebraic covers to the topological setting.
  Finally, we elevate these results to the categorical level. We demonstrate that the classical Weil cocycle condition is equivalent to the existence of a linearization in the language of equivariant categories. Applying this perspective to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $\mathsf{D^b}(X)$, we show that the equivariant derived category $\mathsf{D^b}(X)^G$, under the action induced by a Weil descent datum, recovers the derived category of the descended variety.</description>

      <title>On irreducible factors of polynomials over integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain several new factorization results for certain classes of polynomials having integer coefficients. In doing so, we use the information about prime factorization of the value taken up by such polynomials and their higher order formal derivatives at sufficiently large integer arguments. If a lower bound for the minimum possible degree of a factor of such a polynomial is known a priori, then the integer argument becomes significantly smaller, which makes the underlying factorization result easier to apply. A result on explicit lower degree factor bound for the classes of polynomials considered in this paper is also proved via Newton polygons.</description>

      <title>Sign-reversing involutions in moduli spaces of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use sign-reversing involutions to solve two computational problems that arise naturally in the geometry of moduli spaces of curves. In particular, we give an explicit combinatorial formula for arbitrary $\psi$ class intersection products on the genus zero multicolored spaces $\overline{M}_{0,[r_1,\ldots,r_m]}$ using a novel sign reversing involution on decorated diagrams. As an application, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for when these intersection products are nonzero in terms of matchings on graphs.
  We also calculate the analog of the tropical Euler characteristic for the graphical moduli spaces $\overline{M}_{0,\Gamma}$ for graphs with two dominant vertices $P, Q$, by constructing two new sign-reversing involutions to simplify the sum. We show that (up to sign) it is the number of acyclic orientations of $\Gamma \smallsetminus \{P, Q\}$.</description>

      <title>Enumerative geometry via the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.04378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we relate volumes of moduli spaces of super Riemann surfaces to integrals over the moduli space of stable Riemann surfaces $\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}$. This allows us to prove via algebraic geometry a recursion between the volumes of moduli spaces of super hyperbolic surfaces previously proven via super geometry techniques by Stanford and Witten. The recursion between the volumes of moduli spaces of super hyperbolic surfaces is proven to be equivalent to the fact that a generating function for the intersection numbers of a natural collection of cohomology classes $\Theta_{g,n}$ with tautological classes on $\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}$ is a KdV tau function. This is analogous to Mirzakhani's proof of the Kontsevich-Witten theorem regarding a generating function for the intersection numbers of tautological classes on $\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}$ using volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Motivic Steenrod problem away from the characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In topology, the Steenrod problem asks whether every singular homology class is the pushforward of the fundamental class of a closed oriented manifold. Here, we introduce an analogous question in algebraic geometry: is every element on the Chow line of the motivic cohomology of $X$ the pushforward of a fundamental class along a projective derived-lci morphism? If $X$ is a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p \geq 0$, then a positive answer to this question follows up to $p$-torsion from resolution of singularities by alterations. However, if $X$ is singular, then this is no longer necessarily so: we give examples of motivic cohomology classes of a singular scheme $X$ that are not $p$-torsion and are not expressible as such pushforwards. A consequence of our result is that the Chow ring of a singular variety cannot be expressed as a quotient of its algebraic cobordism ring, as suggested by the first-named-author in his thesis.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between higher Du Bois singularities and $K$-regularity, a notion that measures the $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance of the algebraic $K$-groups. Building on this relationship, we establish a strengthened form of Vorst's conjecture for local complete intersections in characteristic zero. Our work also provides tools to construct new examples that illustrate various phenomena in the study of $K$-regularity. The main inputs for our results are vanishing theorems for the Du Bois complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the combinatorial properties of conic arrangements in the complex projective plane that possess certain quasi-homogeneous singularities. First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize the property of being plus-one generated within the class of conic arrangements with some naturally chosen quasi-homogeneous singularities. Next, we present a classification result on plus-one generated conic arrangements admitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results regarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples of strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements -- that is, arrangements having the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules.</description>

      <title>${\mathbb Z}_{p}^{m}$-actions of type $(d;p,n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ${\mathbb Z}_{p}^{m}$-action of type $(d;p,n)$, where $2 \leq d \leq m \leq n$ are integers, is a pair $(S,N)$ where $S$ is a $d$-dimensional compact complex manifold, $N \cong {\mathbb Z}_{p}^{m}$ is a group of holomorphic automorphisms of $S$ such that the quotient orbifold $S/N$ is the $d$-dimensional projective space ${\mathbb P}^{d}$ whose branch locus consists of $n+1$ hyperplanes in general position, each one of branch order $p$.
  If $(d;p,n) \notin \{(2;2,5),(2;4,3)\}$ and $d+1 \leq n$, then we prove that: (i) $N$ is a normal subgroup of ${\rm Aut}(S)$ and (ii) if $(S,M)$ is a ${\mathbb Z}_{\hat{p}}^{\hat{m}}$-action of type $(d;\hat{p},\hat{n})$, then $M=N$. If, moreover, $d+1 \leq n \leq 2d-1$, then we observe that $S$ is not algebraically hyperbolic</description>

      <title>Transfers on $\mathbb A^1$-connected components of quasi-split groups and the norm principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the sheaf of $\mathbb A^1$-connected components of a quasi-split group over a perfect field is a strictly $\mathbb A^1$-invariant sheaf with (Voevodsky) transfers. As a consequence, we show that the norm principle holds for any quasi-split group over a perfect field.</description>

      <title>On the equation $N_{p_1}(E)\cdot N_{p_2}(E)\cdots N_{p_k}(E)=n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.06283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, let $N_p(E)$ be the number of points on $E$ modulo $p$ for a prime of good reduction for $E$. Given integer $n$, let $G_k(E,n)$ be the number of $k$-tuples of $p_1&lt;p_2&lt;\ldots &lt;p_k$ primes of good reduction for $E$, for which the equation in the title holds, then on assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for elliptic curves without CM (and unconditionally if the curves have complex multiplication), I show that $\varlimsup_{n\to\infty} G_k(E,n)=\infty$ for any integer $k\geq 3$. I conjecture that this result also holds for $k=1,2$ i.e. this conjecture says that there are arbitrarily long ``elliptic progressions of primes'' i.e. sequences of primes $p_1&lt;p_2&lt;\cdots &lt;p_m$ of arbitrary lengths $m$ such that $N_{p_1}(E)=N_{p_2}(E)=\cdots =N_{p_m}(E)$.</description>

      <title>Single-element extensions of matroids over skew tracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.05683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matroids over skew tracts provide an algebraic framework simultaneously generalizing the notions of linear subspaces, matroids, oriented matroids, phased matroids, and some other ``matroids with extra structure". A single-element extension of a matroid $\mathcal{M}$ over a skew tract $T$ is a matroid $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$ over $T$ obtained from $\mathcal{M}$ by adding one more element. Crapo characterized single-element extensions of ordinary matroids, and Las Vergnas characterized single-element extensions of oriented matroids, in terms of single-element extensions of their rank 2 contractions. The results of Crapo and Las Vergnas do not generalize to matroids over skew tracts, but we will show a necessary and sufficient condition on skew tracts, called Pathetic Cancellation, such that the result can generalize to weak matroids over skew tracts.
  Stringent skew hyperfields are a special case of skew tracts which behave in many ways like skew fields. We find a characterization of single-element extensions of strong matroids over stringent skew hyperfields.</description>

      <title>Geometric interactions between bricks and $\tau$-rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For finite-dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields, we consider two fundamental classes of modules and their geometric counterparts: bricks and $\tau$-rigid modules, as well as brick components and $\tau$-regular components. We then apply our results in the study of some open conjectures.
  First, we investigate the situation where every brick is $\tau$-rigid. We prove that this occurs exactly when the algebra is locally representation-directed; a family of algebras introduced by Dr\"axler in the 1990s, which are always representation-finite. Then, we adopt a geometric perspective and analyze the brick and $\tau$-regular components of module varieties. In this greater generality, we establish new properties of such components. Inspired by some recent conjectures, we apply our results to the study of minimal brick-infinite algebras. Along the way, we construct some limits of rigid $g$-vectors, under a condition that we call the $\tau$-convergence property. This construction is novel and, in certain cases, yields an integral $g$-vector lying outside the $\tau$-tilting fan (a.k.a. $g$-vector fan). We show how our results provide new tools to the study of some open conjectures and particularly illustrate that for $E$-tame algebras.</description>

      <title>On Hopkins' Picard group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the algebraic Picard group of the category of $K(n)$-local spectra, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$. In particular, we show that it is always finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \geq 2$, is of rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early 1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a full set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on recent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation on Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.</description>

      <title>Descent Theory for Vertex Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertex algebras can be defined over any differential commutative ring. We develop the general descent theory for vertex algebras over such bases. We apply this to the classification of twisted forms of affine and Heisenberg vertex algebras, and to reinterpret and generalize a correspondence of Li.</description>
