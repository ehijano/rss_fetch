      <title>Neural Symbolic Regression of Complex Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks describe important structures in nature and society, composed of nodes and the edges that connect them. The evolution of these networks is typically described by dynamics, which are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge to derive. However, because the complex network involves noisy observations from multiple trajectories of nodes, existing symbolic regression methods are either not applicable or ineffective on its dynamics. In this paper, we propose Physically Inspired Neural Dynamics Symbolic Regression (PI-NDSR), a method based on neural networks and genetic programming to automatically learn the symbolic expression of dynamics. Our method consists of two key components: a Physically Inspired Neural Dynamics (PIND) to augment and denoise trajectories through observed trajectory interpolation; and a coordinated genetic search algorithm to derive symbolic expressions. This algorithm leverages references of node dynamics and edge dynamics from neural dynamics to avoid overfitted expressions in symbolic space. We evaluate our method on synthetic datasets generated by various dynamics and real datasets on disease spreading. The results demonstrate that PI-NDSR outperforms the existing method in terms of both recovery probability and error.</description>

      <title>Computing with Hypergeometric-Type Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Take a multiplicative monoid of sequences in which the multiplication is given by Hadamard product. The set of linear combinations of interleaving monoid elements then yields a ring. For hypergeometric sequences, the resulting ring is a subring of the ring of holonomic sequences. We present two algorithms in this setting: one for computing holonomic recurrence equations from hypergeometric-type normal forms and the other for finding products of hypergeometric-type terms. These are newly implemented commands in our Maple package $HyperTypeSeq$, available at \url{https://github.com/T3gu1a/HyperTypeSeq}, which we also describe.</description>
