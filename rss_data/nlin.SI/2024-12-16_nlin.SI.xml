      <title>Exotic Coherent Structures and Their Collisional Dynamics in a (3+1) dimensional Bogoyavlensky-Konopelchenko Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the (3+1) dimensional Bogoyavlensky - Konopelchenko equation. Using Painlev\'e Truncation approach, we have constructed solutions in terms of lower dimensional arbitrary functions of space and time. By suitably harnessing the arbitrary functions present in the solution, we have generated physically interesting solutions like periodic solutions, kinks, linear rogue waves, line lumps, dipole lumps and hybrid dromions. It is interesting to note that unlike in (2+1) dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations, the line lumps interact and undergo elastic collision without exchange of energy which is confirmed by the asymptotic analysis. The hybrid dromions are also found to retain their amplitudes during interaction undergoing elastic collision. The highlight of the results is that one also observes the two nonparallel ghost solitons as well whose intersection gives rise to hybrid dromions, a phenomenon not witnessed in (2+1) dimensions.</description>

      <title>Echoes and defects in the Calogero model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in 1D displaying $SO(2,1)$ hidden symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally-relevant drive protocols spanning both quasi-static and non-adiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground state echo amplitude and closely related ground state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

      <title>Eikonal 2.0: General Solutions for Modified Eikonal Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find implicit general solutions for modified eikonal equations $u_a u_a=F(u_t)$, where lower indices at dependent variables designate derivatives, $a=1,2,..,n$, and summation is implied over the repeated indices. We will consider the general solutions and symmetries of these equations.</description>

      <title>On study of transition fronts of Fisher-KPP type reaction-diffusion PDEs by non-linear transformations into exactly solvable class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal dynamics of the evolution of population involving growth and diffusion processes can be modeled by class of partial diffusion equations (PDEs) known as reaction-diffusion systems. In this work, we developed a nonlinear transformations method that converts the original nonlinear Fisher-KPP class of PDEs into an exactly solvable class. We then demonstrated that the proposed nonlinear transformation method intrinsically preserves the relaxation behavior of the solutions to asymptotic values of the non-linear dynamical system. We also show that these particular transforms are very amenable to yield an exact closed form solution in terms of the heat kernel and analytical approximations through the two variable Hermite polynomials. With this proposed method, we calculated the front velocity and shape of the propagating wave and showed how the non-linear transformation affects these parameters for both short and long epochs. As applications, we focus on solving pertinent cases of the Fisher-KPP type of PDEs relating to the evolutionary dynamics by assigning fitness to the mutant gene according to zygosity conditions. We calculated the relaxation of velocity with the parameters of the initial conditions in the following cases, namely, the Fisher, the heterozygote inferior fitness, the heterozygote superior fitness, and finally a general nonlinearity case. We also verified previous conjectures through the exact solutions computed using the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>
