      <title>Counting the number of inequivalent arithmetic expressions on $n$ variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An expression is any mathematical formula that contains certain formal variables and operations to be executed in a specified order. In computer science, it is usually convenient to represent each expression in the form of an expression tree. Here, we consider only arithmetic expressions, i.e., those that contain only the four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, alongside additive inversion. We first provide certain theoretical results concerning the equivalence of such expressions and then disclose a $\Theta(n^2)$ algorithm that computes the number of inequivalent arithmetic expressions on $n$ distinct variables.</description>

      <title>Almost Bipartite non-K\"onig-Egerv\'ary Graphs Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(G)$ denote the cardinality of a maximum independent set, while $\mu(G)$ be the size of a maximum matching in $G=\left( V,E\right) $. It is known that if $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)=\left\vert V\right\vert $, then $G$ is a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph.
  The critical difference $d(G)$ is $\max\{d(I):I\in\mathrm{Ind}(G)\}$, where $\mathrm{Ind}(G)$\ denotes the family of all independent sets of $G$. If $A\in\mathrm{Ind}(G)$ with $d\left( X\right) =d(G)$, then $A$ is a critical independent set. For a graph $G$, let $\mathrm{diadem}(G)=\bigcup\{S:S$ is a critical independent set in $G\}$, and $\varrho_{v}\left( G\right) $ denote the number of vertices $v\in V\left( G\right) $, such that $G-v$ is a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph. A graph is called almost bipartite if it has a unique odd cycle.
  In this paper, we show that if $G$ is an almost bipartite non-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph with the unique odd cycle $C$, then the following assertions are true:
  1. every maximum matching of $G$ contains $\left\lfloor {V(C)}/{2}\right\rfloor $ edges belonging to $C$;
  2. $V(C)\cup N_{G}\left[ \mathrm{diadem}\left( G\right) \right] =V$ and $V(C)\cap N_{G}\left[ \mathrm{diadem}\left( G\right) \right] =\emptyset$;
  3. $\varrho_{v}\left( G\right) =\left\vert \mathrm{corona}\left( G\right) \right\vert -\left\vert \mathrm{diadem}\left( G\right) \right\vert $, where $\mathrm{corona}\left( G\right) $ is the union of all maximum independent sets of $G$;
  4. $\varrho_{v}\left( G\right) =\left\vert V\right\vert $ if and only if $G=C_{2k+1}$ for some integer $k\geq1$.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Evaluation of Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Lower Bounds: Bridging Theory and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curvature serves as a potent and descriptive invariant, with its efficacy validated both theoretically and practically within graph theory. We employ a definition of generalized Ricci curvature proposed by Ollivier, which Lin and Yau later adapted to graph theory, known as Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). ORC measures curvature using the Wasserstein distance, thereby integrating geometric concepts with probability theory and optimal transport. Jost and Liu previously discussed the lower bound of ORC by showing the upper bound of the Wasserstein distance. We extend the applicability of these bounds to discrete spaces with metrics on integers, specifically hypergraphs. Compared to prior work on ORC in hypergraphs by Coupette, Dalleiger, and Rieck, which faced computational challenges, our method introduces a simplified approach with linear computational complexity, making it particularly suitable for analyzing large-scale networks. Through extensive simulations and application to synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate the significant improvements our method offers in evaluating ORC.</description>

      <title>Analogical proportions II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogical reasoning is the ability to detect parallels between two seemingly distant objects or situations, a fundamental human capacity used for example in commonsense reasoning, learning, and creativity which is believed by many researchers to be at the core of human and artificial general intelligence. Analogical proportions are expressions of the form ``$a$ is to $b$ what $c$ is to $d$'' at the core of analogical reasoning. The author has recently introduced an abstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions within the general setting of universal algebra. It is the purpose of this paper to further develop the mathematical theory of analogical proportions within that framework as motivated by the fact that it has already been successfully applied to logic program synthesis in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>On the integrality gap of the Complete Metric Steiner Tree Problem via a novel formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the lower bound of the integrality gap of the Metric Steiner Tree Problem (MSTP) on a graph for some small values of number of nodes and terminals. After debating about some limitations of the most used formulation for the Steiner Tree Problem, namely the Bidirected Cut Formulation, we introduce a novel formulation, that we named Complete Metric formulation, tailored for the metric case. We prove some interesting properties of this formulation and characterize some types of vertices. Finally, we define a linear program (LP) by adapting a method already used in the context of the Travelling Salesman Problem. This LP takes as input a vertex of the polytope of the CM relaxation and provides an MSTP instance such that (a) the optimal solution is precisely that vertex and (b) among all of the instances having that vertex as its optimal solution, the selected instance is the one having the highest integrality gap. We propose two heuristics for generating vertices to provide inputs for our procedure. In conclusion, we raise several conjectures and open questions.</description>

      <title>Sparse Induced Subgraphs of Large Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an induced counterpart of treewidth sparsifiers (i.e., sparse subgraphs keeping the treewidth large) provided by the celebrated Grid Minor theorem of Robertson and Seymour [JCTB '86] or by a classic result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy [SODA '15], we show that for any natural numbers $t$ and $w$, and real $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there is an integer $W := W(t,w,\varepsilon)$ such that every graph with treewidth at least $W$ and no $K_{t,t}$ subgraph admits a 2-connected $n$-vertex induced subgraph with treewidth at least $w$ and at most $(1+\varepsilon)n$ edges. The induced subgraph is either a subdivided wall, or its line graph, or a spanning supergraph of a subdivided biclique. This in particular extends a result of Weissauer [JCTB '19] that graphs of large treewidth have a large biclique subgraph or a long induced cycle.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Corrected Graph Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning for node classification on graphs is a prominent area driven by applications such as recommendation systems. State-of-the-art models often use multiple graph convolutions on the data, as empirical evidence suggests they can enhance performance. However, it has been shown empirically and theoretically, that too many graph convolutions can degrade performance significantly, a phenomenon known as oversmoothing. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, based on the contextual stochastic block model (CSBM), of the performance of vanilla graph convolution from which we remove the principal eigenvector to avoid oversmoothing. We perform a spectral analysis for $k$ rounds of corrected graph convolutions, and we provide results for partial and exact classification. For partial classification, we show that each round of convolution can reduce the misclassification error exponentially up to a saturation level, after which performance does not worsen. For exact classification, we show that the separability threshold can be improved exponentially up to $O({\log{n}}/{\log\log{n}})$ corrected convolutions.</description>

      <title>Practical $0.385$-Approximation for Submodular Maximization Subject to a Cardinality Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-monotone constrained submodular maximization plays a crucial role in various machine learning applications. However, existing algorithms often struggle with a trade-off between approximation guarantees and practical efficiency. The current state-of-the-art is a recent $0.401$-approximation algorithm, but its computational complexity makes it highly impractical. The best practical algorithms for the problem only guarantee $1/e$-approximation. In this work, we present a novel algorithm for submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint that combines a guarantee of $0.385$-approximation with a low and practical query complexity of $O(n+k^2)$. Furthermore, we evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm in experiments based on various machine learning applications, including Movie Recommendation, Image Summarization, and more. These experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a signed version of the Hammersley process, a discrete process on words related to a property of integer sequences called heapability (Byers et al., ANALCO 2011). The specific version that we investigate corresponds to a version of this property for signed sequences.
  We give a characterization of the words that can appear as images the signed Hammersley process. In particular we show that the language of such words is the intersection of two deterministic one-counter languages.</description>

      <title>First Order Logic of Sparse Graphs with Given Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider limit probabilities of first order properties in random graphs with a given degree sequence. Under mild conditions on the degree sequence, we show that the closure set of limit probabilities is a finite union of closed intervals. Moreover, we characterize the degree sequences for which this closure set is the interval $[0,1]$, a property that is intimately related with the probability that the random graph is acyclic. As a side result, we compile a full description of the cycle distribution of random graphs and study their fragment (disjoint union of unicyclic components) in the subcritical regime. Finally, we amend the proof of the existence of limit probabilities for first order properties in random graphs with a given degree sequence; this result was already claimed by Lynch~[IEEE LICS 2003] but his proof contained some inaccuracies.</description>

Abstract: We study the graph parameter elimination distance to bounded degree, which was introduced by Bulian and Dawar in their study of the parameterized complexity of the graph isomorphism problem. We prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs, that is, there exists an algorithm that given a planar graph $G$ and integers $d$ and $k$ decides in time $f(k,d)\cdot n^c$ for a computable function~$f$ and constant $c$ whether the elimination distance of $G$ to the class of degree $d$ graphs is at most $k$.</description>

      <title>All Graphs with at most 8 nodes are 2-interval-PCGs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph G is a multi-interval PCG if there exist an edge weighted tree T with non-negative real values and disjoint intervals of the non-negative real half-line such that each node of G is uniquely associated to a leaf of T and there is an edge between two nodes in G if and only if the weighted distance between their corresponding leaves in T lies within any such intervals. If the number of intervals is k, then we call the graph a k-interval-PCG; in symbols, G = k-interval-PCG (T, I1, . . . , Ik). It is known that 2-interval-PCGs do not contain all graphs and the smallest known graph outside this class has 135 nodes. Here we prove that all graphs with at most 8 nodes are 2-interval-PCGs, so doing one step towards the determination of the smallest value of n such that there exists an n node graph that is not a 2-interval-PCG.</description>

      <title>A Strongly Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Weighted General Factors with Three Feasible Degrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General factors are a generalization of matchings. Given a graph $G$ with a set $\pi(v)$ of feasible degrees, called a degree constraint, for each vertex $v$ of $G$, the general factor problem is to find a (spanning) subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that $\text{deg}_F(x) \in \pi(v)$ for every $v$ of $G$. When all degree constraints are symmetric $\Delta$-matroids, the problem is solvable in polynomial time. The weighted general factor problem is to find a general factor of the maximum total weight in an edge-weighted graph. In this paper, we present the first strongly polynomial-time algorithm for a type of weighted general factor problems with real-valued edge weights that is provably not reducible to the weighted matching problem by gadget constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $M,$ path eigenvalues are eigenvalues of its path matrix. The path energy of a simple graph $M$ is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the path eigenvalues of the graph $M$ (Shikare et. al, 2018). We have discovered new upper constraints on path energy in this study, expressed in terms of a graph's maximum degree. Additionally, a relationship between a graph's energy and path energy is given.</description>

Here l(1),...,l(n) is a non-decreasing list of the eigenvalues of K and d(1),..,d(n) is a non-decreasing list of vertex degrees with the additional assumption d(0)=0. We also prove that in general the weak Brouwer-Haemers lower bound d(k) + (n-k) holds for all eigenvalues l(k) of the Kirchhoff matrix of a quiver.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic bounds for the number of closed and privileged words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A word~$w$ has a border $u$ if $u$ is a non-empty proper prefix and suffix of $u$. A word~$w$ is said to be \emph{closed} if $w$ is of length at most $1$ or if $w$ has a border that occurs exactly twice in $w$. A word~$w$ is said to be \emph{privileged} if $w$ is of length at most $1$ or if $w$ has a privileged border that occurs exactly twice in $w$. Let $C_k(n)$ (resp.~$P_k(n)$) be the number of length-$n$ closed (resp. privileged) words over a $k$-letter alphabet. In this paper, we improve existing upper and lower bounds on $C_k(n)$ and $P_k(n)$. We completely resolve the asymptotic behaviour of $C_k(n)$. We also nearly completely resolve the asymptotic behaviour of $P_k(n)$ by giving a family of upper and lower bounds that are separated by a factor that grows arbitrarily slowly.</description>

Abstract: Assouad-Nagata dimension addresses both large and small scale behaviors of metric spaces and is a refinement of Gromov's asymptotic dimension. A metric space $M$ is a minor-closed metric if there exists an (edge-)weighted graph $G$ satisfying a fixed minor-closed property such that the underlying space of $M$ is the vertex-set of $G$, and the metric of $M$ is the distance function in $G$. Minor-closed metrics naturally arise when removing redundant edges of the underlying graphs by using edge-deletion and edge-contraction. In this paper, we determine the Assouad-Nagata dimension of every minor-closed metric. Our main theorem simultaneously generalizes known results about the asymptotic dimension of $H$-minor free unweighted graphs and about the Assouad-Nagata dimension of complete Riemannian surfaces with finite Euler genus.</description>

      <title>Subdivisions in dicritical digraphs with large order or digirth</title>

Abstract: Aboulker et al. proved that a digraph with large enough dichromatic number contains any fixed digraph as a subdivision. The dichromatic number of a digraph is the smallest order of a partition of its vertex set into acyclic induced subdigraphs. A digraph is dicritical if the removal of any arc or vertex decreases its dichromatic number. In this paper we give sufficient conditions on a dicritical digraph of large order or large directed girth to contain a given digraph as a subdivision. In particular, we prove that (i) for every integers $k,\ell$, large enough dicritical digraphs with dichromatic number $k$ contain an orientation of a cycle with at least $\ell$ vertices; (ii) there are functions $f,g$ such that for every subdivision $F^*$ of a digraph $F$, digraphs with directed girth at least $f(F^*)$ and dichromatic number at least $g(F)$ contain a subdivision of $F^*$, and if $F$ is a tree, then $g(F)=|V(F)|$; (iii) there is a function $f$ such that for every subdivision $F^*$ of $TT_3$ (the transitive tournament on three vertices), digraphs with directed girth at least $f(F^*)$ and minimum out-degree at least $2$ contain $F^*$ as a subdivision.</description>

      <title>Online Algorithm for Node Feature Forecasting in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16800</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an online algorithm mspace for forecasting node features in temporal graphs, which captures spatial cross-correlation among different nodes as well as the temporal auto-correlation within a node. The algorithm can be used for both probabilistic and deterministic multi-step forecasting, making it applicable for estimation and generation tasks. Comparative evaluations against various baselines, including temporal graph neural network (TGNN) models and classical Kalman filters, demonstrate that mspace performs at par with the state-of-the-art and even surpasses them on some datasets. Importantly, mspace demonstrates consistent performance across datasets with varying training sizes, a notable advantage over TGNN models that require abundant training samples to effectively learn the spatiotemporal trends in the data. Therefore, employing mspace is advantageous in scenarios where the training sample availability is limited. Additionally, we establish theoretical bounds on multi-step forecasting error of mspace and show that it scales linearly with the number of forecast steps $q$ as $\mathcal{O}(q)$. For an asymptotically large number of nodes $n$, and timesteps $T$, the computational complexity of mspace grows linearly with both $n$, and $T$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nT)$, while its space complexity remains constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We compare the performance of various mspace variants against ten recent TGNN baselines and two classical baselines, ARIMA and the Kalman filter across ten real-world datasets. Additionally, we propose a technique to generate synthetic datasets to aid in evaluating node feature forecasting methods, with the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research. Lastly, we have investigate the interpretability of different mspace variants by analyzing model parameters alongside dataset characteristics to derive model and data-centric insights.</description>

      <title>Discretely Beyond $1/e$: Guided Combinatorial Algorithms for Submodular Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For constrained, not necessarily monotone submodular maximization, all known approximation algorithms with ratio greater than $1/e$ require continuous ideas, such as queries to the multilinear extension of a submodular function and its gradient, which are typically expensive to simulate with the original set function. For combinatorial algorithms, the best known approximation ratios for both size and matroid constraint are obtained by a simple randomized greedy algorithm of Buchbinder et al. [9]: $1/e \approx 0.367$ for size constraint and $0.281$ for the matroid constraint in $\mathcal O (kn)$ queries, where $k$ is the rank of the matroid. In this work, we develop the first combinatorial algorithms to break the $1/e$ barrier: we obtain approximation ratio of $0.385$ in $\mathcal O (kn)$ queries to the submodular set function for size constraint, and $0.305$ for a general matroid constraint. These are achieved by guiding the randomized greedy algorithm with a fast local search algorithm. Further, we develop deterministic versions of these algorithms, maintaining the same ratio and asymptotic time complexity. Finally, we develop a deterministic, nearly linear time algorithm with ratio $0.377$.</description>
