      <title>Joint Optimization of Pattern, Headway, and Fleet Size of Multiple Urban Transit Lines with Perceived Headway Consideration and Passenger Flow Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the urban transit pattern design problem, optimizing stop sequences, headways, and fleet sizes across multiple routes simultaneously to minimize user costs (composed of riding, waiting, and transfer times) under operational constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity and fleet size). A destination-labeled multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) formulation is developed to solve the problem at a large scale more efficiently compared to the previous literature. The model allows for flexible pattern options without relying on pre-defined candidate sets and simultaneously considers multiple operational strategies such as express/local services, short-turning, and deadheading. It evaluates perceived headways of joint patterns for passengers, assigns passenger flows to each pattern accordingly, and allows transfers across patterns in different directions. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is demonstrated with a city-sized network of metro lines in Chicago, USA, achieving near-optimal solutions in hours. The total weighted journey times are reduced by 0.61% and 4.13% under single-route and multi-route scenarios respectively. The model provides transit agencies with an efficient tool for comprehensive service design and resource allocation, improving service quality and resource utilization without additional operational costs.</description>

      <title>Improved formulation for long-duration storage in capacity expansion models using representative periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity and size of capacity expansion models, temporal aggregation has emerged as a common method to improve computational tractability. However, this approach inherently complicates the inclusion of long-duration storage (LDS) systems, whose operation involves the entire time horizon connecting all time steps. This work presents a detailed investigation of LDS modelling with temporal aggregation. A novel compact formulation is proposed to reduce the number of constraints while effectively tracking the storage content and enforcing limits on the state of charge throughout the entire time horizon. The developed method is compared with two leading state-of-the-art formulations. All three methods are implemented in the Dolphyn capacity expansion model and tested on a case study for the continental United States, considering different configurations in terms of spatial resolutions and representative periods. The performance is assessed with both the commercial solver Gurobi and the open-source solver HiGHS. Results show that the developed compact formulation consistently outperforms the other methods in terms of both runtime (30%-70% faster than other methods) and memory usage (1%-9% lower than other methods).</description>

      <title>State estimation for parallel-connected batteries via inverse dynamic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the problem of estimating the states, including state of charge, of battery cells connected in parallel. Previous research highlights the importance of this problem, and presents multiple approaches for solving it. Algorithm scalability and observability analysis can both be challenging, particularly because the underlying pack dynamics are governed by differential algebraic equations. Our work addresses these challenges from a novel perspective that begins by inverting the causality of parallel pack dynamics, which breaks the pack model's underlying algebraic loop. This simplifies observability analysis and observer design significantly, leading to three novel contributions. First, the paper derives mathematical conditions for state observability that apply regardless of the number of battery cells and the order of their individual dynamics. Second, the paper presents an approach for grouping battery cells such that their lumped dynamics are observable. Finally, the paper presents a novel pack state estimator that achieves computational tractability by employing inverse dynamic modeling. We conclude by presenting a Monte Carlo simulation study of this estimator using experimentally-parameterized models of two battery chemistries. The simulation results highlight the computational benefits of both the clustering strategy and inverse dynamics approach for state estimation.</description>

      <title>Safe Delay-Adaptive Control of Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems with Application in Vehicle Platooning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a safe delay-adaptive control for a strict-feedback nonlinear ODE with a delayed actuator, whose dynamic is also a strict-feedback nonlinear ODE and the delay length is unknown. By formulating the delay as a transport PDE, the plant becomes a sandwich configuration consisting of nonlinear ODE-transport PDE-nonlinear ODE, where the transport speed in the PDE is unknown. We propose a predictor-based nonovershooting backstepping transformation to build the nominal safe delay-compensated control, guaranteeing that the output of the distal ODE safely tracks the target trajectory from one side without undershooting. To address the uncertainty in the delay, we incorporate recent delay-adaptive and safe adaptive technologies to build a safe adaptive-delay controller. The adaptive closed-loop system ensures 1) the exact identification of the unknown delay in finite time; 2) the output state stays in the safe region all the time, especially in the original safe region, instead of a subset, after a finite time; 3) all states are bounded, and moreover, they will converge to zero if the target trajectory is identically zero. In the simulation, the proposed control design is verified in the application of safe vehicle platooning. It regulates the spacing between adjacent vehicles to converge to a small distance and avoids collisions by ensuring they do not breach the safe distance at any time, even in the presence of large unknown delays and at a relatively high speed.</description>

      <title>Implicit Euler Discrete-Time Set-Valued Admittance Control for Impact-Contact Force Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Admittance control is a commonly used strategy for regulating robotic systems, such as quadruped and humanoid robots, allowing them to respond compliantly to contact forces during interactions with their environments. However, it can lead to instability and unsafe behaviors like snapping back and overshooting due to torque saturation from impacts with unknown stiffness environments. This paper introduces a novel admittance controller that ensures stable force control after impacting unknown stiffness environments by leveraging the differentiability of impact-contact forces. The controller is mathematically represented by a differential algebraic inclusion (DAI) comprising two interdependent set-valued loops. The first loop employs set-valued first-order sliding mode control (SMC) to limit input torque post-impact. The second loop utilizes the multivariable super-twisting algorithm (MSTA) to mitigate unstable motion caused by impact forces when interacting with unknown stiffness environments. Implementing this proposed admittance control in digital settings presents challenges due to the interconnected structure of the two set-valued loops, unlike implicit Euler discretization methods for set-valued SMCs. To facilitate implementation, this paper offers a new algorithm for implicit Euler discretization of the DAI. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed admittance controller outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Analytical Construction of CBF-Based Safety Filters for Simultaneous State and Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem explored in [1] of guaranteeing satisfaction of multiple simultaneous state constraints applied to a single-input, single-output plant consisting of a chain of n integrators subject to input limitations. For this problem setting, we derive an analytic, easy-to-implement safety filter which respects input limitations and ensures forward-invariance of all state constraints simultaneously. Additionally, we provide a straightforward extension to the multi-input, multi-output chained integrator setting, and provide an analytic safety filter guaranteeing satisfaction of arbitrarily many simultaneous hyperplane constraints on the output vector. Whereas the approach in [1] obtains maximal invariant sets, our approach trades off some degree of conservatism in exchange for a recursive safety filter which is analytic for any arbitrary n &gt;= 1.</description>

      <title>Co-investment with Payoff Sharing Benefit Operators and Users in Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network-based complex systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and performance of subnetworks being interdependent. However, the decisions of self-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users. In this paper, we consider the question of what cooperative mechanisms can benefit both operators and users simultaneously. We address this question in a game theoretical setting, integrating both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. During the non-cooperative stage, subnetwork decision-makers strategically design their local networks. In the cooperative stage, the co-investment mechanism and the payoff-sharing mechanism are developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute them. A case study of the Sioux Falls network is conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. The impact of this interactive network design on environmental sustainability, social welfare and economic efficiency is evaluated, along with an examination of scenarios involving regions with heterogeneous characteristics.</description>

      <title>Construction of the Sparsest Maximally $r$-Robust Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the notion of r-robustness for the communication graph of the network has been introduced to address the challenge of achieving consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Higher r-robustness typically implies higher tolerance to malicious information towards achieving resilient consensus, but it also implies more edges for the communication graph. This in turn conflicts with the need to minimize communication due to limited resources in real-world applications (e.g., multi-robot networks). In this paper, our contributions are twofold. (a) We provide the necessary subgraph structures and tight lower bounds on the number of edges required for graphs with a given number of nodes to achieve maximum robustness. (b) We then use the results of (a) to introduce two classes of graphs that maintain maximum robustness with the least number of edges. Our work is validated through a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>Joint Trajectory Replanning for Mars Ascent Vehicle under Propulsion System Faults: A Suboptimal Learning-Based Warm-Start Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) launch missions, when encountering a thrust drop type of propulsion system fault problem, the general trajectory replanning methods relying on step-by-step judgments may fail to make timely decisions, potentially leading to mission failure. This paper proposes a suboptimal joint trajectory replanning (SJTR) method, which formulates the joint optimization problem of target orbit and flight trajectory after a fault within a convex optimization framework. By incorporating penalty coefficients for terminal constraints, the optimization solution adheres to the orbit redecision principle, thereby avoiding complex decision-making processes and resulting in a concise and rapid solution to the replanning problem. A learning-based warm-start scheme is proposed in conjunction with the designed SJTR method. Offline, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a dataset generated by the SJTR method. Online, the DNN provides initial guesses for the time optimization variables based on the current fault situation, enhancing the solving efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. Numerical simulations of the MAV flight scenario under the thrust drop faults are performed, and Monte Carlo experiments and case studies across all orbit types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Methods for Mitigating Uncertainty in Real-Time Operations of a Connected Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of a two-stage control strategy for the energy management system (EMS) of a grid-connected microgrid under uncertain solar irradiance and load demand using a real-world dataset from an island in Southeast Asia (SEA). The first stage computes a day-ahead commitment for power profile exchanged with the main grid, while the second stage focuses on real-time controls to minimize the system operating cost. Given the challenges in accurately forecasting solar irradiance for a long time horizon, scenario-based stochastic programming (SP) is considered for the first stage. For the second stage, as the most recent weather conditions can be used, several methodologies to handle the uncertainties are investigated, including: (1) the rule-based method historically deployed on EMS, (2) model predictive controller (MPC) using either an explicit forecast or scenario-based stochastic forecast, and (3) Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) computing its own implicit forecast through a distribution of costs. Performances of these methodologies are compared in terms of precision with a reference control assuming perfect forecast -- i.e. representing the minimal achievable operation cost in theory. Obtained results show that MPC with a stochastic forecast outperforms MPC with a simple deterministic prediction. This suggests that using an explicit forecast, even within a short time window, is challenging. Using weather conditions can, however, be more efficient, as demonstrated by DRL (with implicit forecast), outperforming MPC with stochastic forecast by 1.3\%.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Semidefinite Relaxation Model Combined with Clique Graph Merging Strategy for Efficient AC Optimal Power Flow Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) is widely acknowledged as one of the most effective methods for deriving the tightest lower bounds of the optimal power flow (OPF) problems. In this paper, an enhanced semidefinite relaxation model that integrates tighter {\lambda}-based quadratic convex relaxation, valid inequalities, and optimality-based bound tightening algorithms derived in accordance with the branch thermal limit boundary surface into the SDP framework is presented to further tighten the lower bounds of the feasible region of OPF problems, effectively combining the advantages of these recent advancements. Additionally, the utilization of chordal decomposition in the complex matrix formulation of SDP can significantly accelerate the solution time. Notably, for the same SDP problem, different chordal decompositions can result in varying solution time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a clique graph merging strategy within the complex matrix SDP framework, which assesses clique sizes and the computational burden on interior-point solvers, as well as reducing the need for hyperparameter tuning and further enhancing the solution efficiency. Finally, the proposed hybrid relaxation model is evaluated using MATPOWER and PGLib-OPF test cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the optimality gap and validating its computational performance on test cases with up to 13659-node.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation in Optimal Tolling for Traffic Networks Under the Markovian Traffic Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tolling, or congestion pricing, has emerged as an effective tool for preventing gridlock in traffic systems. However, tolls are currently mostly designed on route-based traffic assignment models (TAM), which may be unrealistic and computationally expensive. Existing approaches also impractically assume that the central tolling authority can access latency function parameters that characterize the time required to traverse each network arc (edge), as well as the entropy parameter $\beta$ that characterizes commuters' stochastic arc-selection decisions on the network. To address these issues, this work formulates an online learning algorithm that simultaneously refines estimates of linear arc latency functions and entropy parameters in an arc-based TAM, while implementing tolls on each arc to induce equilibrium flows that minimize overall congestion on the network. We prove that our algorithm incurs regret upper bounded by $O(\sqrt{T} \ln(T) |\arcsMod| \max\{|\nodesMod| \ln(|\arcsMod|/|\nodesMod|), B \})$, where $T$ denotes the total iteration count, $|\arcsMod|$ and $|\nodesMod|$ denote the total number of arcs and nodes in the network, respectively, and $B$ describes the number of arcs required to construct an estimate of $\beta$ (usually $\ll |I|$). Finally, we present numerical results on simulated traffic networks that validate our theoretical contributions.</description>

Abstract: We consider an autonomous vehicle (AV) agent performing a long-term cost-minimization problem in the elapsed time $T$ over sequences of states $s_{1:T}$ and actions $a_{1:T}$ for some fixed, known (though potentially learned) cost function $C(s_t,a_t)$, approximate system dynamics $P$, and distribution over initial states $d_0$. The goal is to minimize the expected cost-to-go of the driving trajectory $\tau = s_1, a_1, ..., s_T, a_T$ from the initial state.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Malicious Agent Detection Scheme for Resilient Power Apportioning in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the framework of distributed aggregation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in power networks to provide ancillary services to the power grid. Existing aggregation schemes work under the assumption of trust and honest behavior of the DERs and can suffer when that is not the case. In this article, we develop a distributed detection scheme that allows the DERs to detect and isolate the maliciously behaving DERs. We propose a model for the maliciously behaving DERs and show that the proposed distributed scheme leads to the detection of the malicious DERs. Further, augmented with the distributed power apportioning algorithm the proposed scheme provides a framework for resilient distributed power apportioning for ancillary service dispatch in power networks. A controller-hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) experimental setup is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed resilient distributed power apportioning scheme on an 8-commercial building distribution network (Central Core) connected to a 55 bus distribution network (External Power Network) based on the University of Minnesota Campus. A diversity of DERs and loads are included in the network to generalize the applicability of the framework. The experimental results corroborate the efficacy of the proposed resilient distributed power apportioning for ancillary service dispatch in power networks.</description>

      <title>A Plug and Play Distributed Secondary Controller for Microgrids with Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed controller for secondary control problems in microgrids with grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) is developed. The controller is based on distributed optimization and is synthesized and implemented distributively enabling each GFM IBR to utilize decentralized measurements and the neighborhood information in the communication network. We present a convergence analysis establishing voltage regulation and reactive power sharing properties. A controller-hardware-in-the-loop experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller. The experimental results corroborate the efficacy of the proposed distributed controller for secondary control.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Constraint Admissible Invariant Set with Neural Lyapunov Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint admissible positively invariant (CAPI) sets play a pivotal role in ensuring safety in control and planning applications, such as the recursive feasibility guarantee of explicit reference governor and model predictive control. However, existing methods for finding CAPI sets for nonlinear systems are often limited to single equilibria or specific system dynamics. This limitation underscores the necessity for a method to construct a CAPI set for general reference tracking control and a broader range of systems. In this work, we leverage recent advancements in learning-based methods to derive Lyapunov functions, particularly focusing on those with piecewise-affine activation functions. Previous attempts to find an invariant set with the piecewise-affine neural Lyapunov function have focused on the estimation of the region of attraction with mixed integer programs. We propose a methodology to determine the maximal CAPI set for any reference with the neural Lyapunov function by transforming the problem into multiple linear programs. Additionally, to enhance applicability in real-time control scenarios, we introduce a learning-based approach to train the estimator, which infers the CAPI set from a given reference. The proposed approach is validated with multiple simulations to show that it can generate a valid CAPI set with the given neural Lyapunov functions for any reference. We also employ the proposed CAPI set estimation method in the explicit reference governor and demonstrate its effectiveness for constrained control.</description>

      <title>Tannenbaum's gain-margin optimization meets Polyak's heavy-ball algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper highlights a relatively unknown link between algorithm design in optimization and control synthesis in robust control. Specifically, quadratic optimization can be recast as a regulation problem within the framework of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. From this vantage point, the optimality of Polyak's fastest heavy-ball algorithm can be ascertained as a solution to a gain margin optimization problem. The approach is independent of Polyak's original and brilliant argument, yet simpler, and relies on the foundational work by Tannenbaum that introduced and solved the gain margin optimization via Nevanlinna--Pick interpolation theory. The link between first-order optimization methods and robust control theory sheds new light into limits of algorithmic performance for such methods, and suggests a new framework where similar computational problems can be systematically studied and algorithms optimized. In particular, it raises the question as to whether periodically scheduled algorithms can achieve faster rates for quadratic optimization, in a manner analogous to periodic control that extends gain margin beyond that of time-invariant control. This turns out not to be the case, due to the analytic obstruction of a transmission zero that is inherent in causal optimization algorithms. Interestingly, this obstruction can be removed with implicit algorithms, cast in a similar manner as feedback regulation problems with causal, but not strictly causal dynamics, thereby devoid of the transmission zero at infinity and able to achieve superior convergence rates. The confluence of the fields of optimization algorithms and control provides a frame to tackle questions pertaining to speed, accuracy, distributed computation, and so forth, and to delineate respective limits to performance and tradeoffs in a systematic manner, utilizing the formalism of robust control.</description>

      <title>A Screening Method for Power System Inertia Zones Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterogeneous distribution of frequency support from dispersed renewable generation sources results in varying inertia within the system. The effects of disturbances exhibit non-uniform variations contingent upon the disturbance's location and the affected region's topology and inertia. A screening method for inertia-zone identification is proposed considering the combination of network structure and generator inertia distribution that will aid in comprehending the response of nodes to disturbances. The nodes' dynamic nodal weight (DNW) is defined using maximal entropy random walk that defines each node's spreading power dynamics. Further, a modified weighted kmeans++ clustering technique is proposed using DNW to obtain the equivalent spatial points of each zone and the system to parameterize the inertia status of each zone. The impact of the proposed scheme is justified by simulating a modified IEEE 39 bus system with doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) integration in the real-time digital simulator.</description>

      <title>Advanced Resilience Planning for Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, posing significant challenges for power distribution systems. In response, this work presents a planning approach in order to enhance the resilience of distribution systems against climatic hazards. The framework systematically addresses uncertainties during extreme events, including weather variability and line damage. Key strategies include line hardening, backup diesel generators, and sectionalizers to strengthen resilience. We model spatio-temporal dynamics and costs through a hybrid model integrating stochastic processes with deterministic elements. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear approach is developed to optimize resilience investments against load loss, generator operations, and repairs. Case studies on the IEEE 15-bus benchmark system and a realistic distribution grid model in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia demonstrate enhanced system robustness as well as cost efficiency of 10% and 15%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Design and validation of a fuzzy logic controller for multi-section continuum robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of multi-section continuum robots (CRs) has captivated researchers and practitioners across diverse industries and medical fields. Accurate modeling of these dexterous manipulators continues to be a significant challenge. This complexity stems primarily from many nonlinearities that plague their behavior, including hysteresis and cable elongation. Researchers have devised a spectrum of model-based and learning-based strategies to navigate this intricate landscape, aiming to conquer the modeling problem and elevate control performance. Despite the advancements in these approaches, they encounter challenges stemming from their complex design and intricate learning processes, impairing versatility and hindering robust closed-loop control. This paper introduces a simple-structured, model-less fuzzy logic controller for the closed-loop control of continuum robots. Unlike traditional methods relying on complex models and numerous sensors, this controller boasts a built-in shape reconstruction algorithm. This algorithm allows it to achieve robust control using only the feedback of end position and orientation, significantly reducing sensor dependence. It efficiently adapts to various nonlinearities like hysteresis, cable elongation, and unexpected external disturbances. The experimental results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed fuzzy controller. On a three-section, six-degree-of-freedom continuum robot, it achieved a miniscule trajectory tracking Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 0.28 to 0.54 mm, representing just 0.17 to 0.32% of the robot's length. Additionally, the controller demonstrates robustness by successfully handling an unexpected external disturbance of 100g during the trajectory tracking.</description>

      <title>A simple controller design to achieve iso-damping robustness: Non-iterative data-driven approach based on fractional-order reference model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a simple controller design approach to achieve a class of robustness, the so-called iso-damping property. The proposed approach can be executed using only one-shot input/output data. An accurate mathematical model of a controlled plant is not required. The model-reference control problem is defined to achieve the desired closed-loop specifications, including the iso-damping, and the reference model is designed on the basis of fractional-order calculus. The optimization problem for the model-reference control is formulated using the one-shot input/output data while considering the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. The iso-damping robust controller is obtained by solving the optimization problem. The representative advantages of the proposed approach over the conventional methods are the simplicity, practicality, and reliability from the viewpoint of the unnecessity of the plant model and explicit consideration of the BIBO stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Metrics for Wildfire Ignition Risk from Geographic Data in Power Shutoff Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faults on power lines and other electric equipment are known to cause wildfire ignitions. To mitigate the threat of wildfire ignitions from electric power infrastructure, many utilities preemptively de-energize power lines, which may result in power shutoffs. Data regarding wildfire ignition risks are key inputs for effective planning of power line de-energizations. However, there are multiple ways to formulate risk metrics that spatially aggregate wildfire risk map data, and there are different ways of leveraging this data to make decisions. The key contribution of this paper is to define and compare the results of employing six metrics for quantifying the wildfire ignition risks of power lines from risk maps, considering both threshold- and optimization-based methods for planning power line de-energizations. The numeric results use the California Test System (CATS), a large-scale synthetic grid model with power line corridors accurately representing California infrastructure, in combination with real Wildland Fire Potential Index data for a full year. This is the first application of optimal power shutoff planning on such a large and realistic test case. Our results show that the choice of risk metric significantly impacts the lines that are de-energized and the resulting load shed. We find that the optimization-based method results in significantly less load shed than the threshold-based method while achieving the same risk reduction.</description>

      <title>Formally Verified Physics-Informed Neural Control Lyapunov Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Lyapunov functions are a central tool in the design and analysis of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems. Constructing such functions, however, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate physics-informed learning and formal verification of neural network control Lyapunov functions. These neural networks solve a transformed Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, augmented by data generated using Pontryagin's maximum principle. Similar to how Zubov's equation characterizes the domain of attraction for autonomous systems, this equation characterizes the null-controllability set of a controlled system. This principled learning of neural network control Lyapunov functions outperforms alternative approaches, such as sum-of-squares and rational control Lyapunov functions, as demonstrated by numerical examples. As an intermediate step, we also present results on the formal verification of quadratic control Lyapunov functions, which, aided by satisfiability modulo theories solvers, can perform surprisingly well compared to more sophisticated approaches and efficiently produce global certificates of null-controllability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in robotics is to design robust policies which enable complex and agile behaviors in the real world. On one end of the spectrum, we have model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL), which is incredibly flexible and general but often results in brittle policies. In contrast, model predictive control (MPC) continually re-plans at each time step to remain robust to perturbations and model inaccuracies. However, despite its real-world successes, MPC often under-performs the optimal strategy. This is due to model quality, myopic behavior from short planning horizons, and approximations due to computational constraints. And even with a perfect model and enough compute, MPC can get stuck in bad local optima, depending heavily on the quality of the optimization algorithm. To this end, we propose Deep Model Predictive Optimization (DMPO), which learns the inner-loop of an MPC optimization algorithm directly via experience, specifically tailored to the needs of the control problem. We evaluate DMPO on a real quadrotor agile trajectory tracking task, on which it improves performance over a baseline MPC algorithm for a given computational budget. It can outperform the best MPC algorithm by up to 27% with fewer samples and an end-to-end policy trained with MFRL by 19%. Moreover, because DMPO requires fewer samples, it can also achieve these benefits with 4.3X less memory. When we subject the quadrotor to turbulent wind fields with an attached drag plate, DMPO can adapt zero-shot while still outperforming all baselines.

      <description>arXiv:2409.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Markov decision process-based state switching is devised, implemented, and analyzed for proximity operations of various autonomous vehicles. The framework contains a pose estimator along with a multi-state guidance algorithm. The unified pose estimator leverages the extended Kalman filter for the fusion of measurements from rate gyroscopes, monocular vision, and ultra-wideband radar sensors. It is also equipped with Mahalonobis distance-based outlier rejection and under-weighting of measurements for robust performance. The use of probabilistic Markov models to transition between various guidance modes is proposed to enable robust and efficient proximity operations. Finally, the framework is validated through an experimental analysis of the docking of two small satellites and the precision landing of an aerial vehicle.</description>

      <title>Calibrating microscopic traffic models with macroscopic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic microsimulation is a crucial tool that uses microscopic traffic models, such as car-following and lane-change models, to simulate the trajectories of individual agents. This digital platform allows for the assessment of the impact of emerging technologies on transportation system performance. While these microscopic models are based on mathematical structures, their parameters must be fitted to real-world data through a process called model calibration. Despite extensive studies on calibration, the focus has predominantly been on fitting microscopic data, such as trajectories, rather than evaluating how well the models reproduce macroscopic traffic patterns, such as congestion, bottlenecks, and traffic waves. In this work, we address this gap by calibrating microscopic traffic flow models using macroscopic (aggregated) data, which is more readily accessible. We designed a SUMO-in-the-loop calibration framework with the goal of replicating observed macroscopic traffic features. To assess calibration accuracy, we developed a set of performance measures that evaluate the models' ability to replicate traffic states across the entire spatiotemporal domain and other qualitative characteristics of traffic flow. The calibration method was applied to both a synthetic scenario and a real-world scenario on a segment of Interstate 24, to demonstrate its effectiveness in reproducing observed traffic patterns.</description>

Abstract: As the world enters the journey toward the 6th generation (6G) of wireless technology, the promises of ultra-high data rates, unprecedented low latency, and a massive surge in connected devices require crucial exploration of network energy saving (NES) solutions to minimize the carbon footprint and overall energy usage of future cellular networks. On the other hand, network-controlled repeaters (NCRs) have been introduced by 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) as a cost-effective solution to improve network coverage. However, their impact on network power consumption and energy efficiency has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper studies NES schemes for next-generation 6G networks aided by NCRs and proposes optimal NES strategies aiming at maximizing the overall energy efficiency of the network. Repeaters are shown to allow for power savings at next-generation nodeB (gNB), and offer higher overall energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE), thus providing an energy-efficient and cost-efficient alternative to increase the performance of future 6G networks</description>

      <title>SensoPatch: A Reconfigurable Haptic Feedback with High-Density Tactile Sensing Glove</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Haptic feedback is integral to the improved experience of prosthetic users and the reduction in prosthesis rejection. Prior studies have explored various methods to encode tactile information and deliver vibration feedback. However, a comprehensive study comparing performance across different stimulation locations and feedback modalities for wearable devices is absent and there is no test platform. This paper proposes an open-source reconfigurable haptic feedback system which incorporates 25 sensors and wireless communication to allow customized number of vibration motors, adjustable motor placement, and programmable encoding of tactile data to change feedback modalities. To demonstrate potential studies that can be investigated using SensoPatch, we conducted two experiments: 1) to assess the vibration discrimination accuracy on 3 body parts 2) to assess the effect of 6 methods of mapping tactile data to varying number of motors on object manipulation. SensoPatch utilizes low-cost off-the-shelf components, enabling large-scale comparative studies of feedback modalities and stimulation sites to optimize vibrotactile feedback and facilitate its deployment in upper limb prostheses.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization via Energy Conservation Laws in Dilated Coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing problems in a distributed manner is critical for systems involving multiple agents with private data. Despite substantial interest, a unified method for analyzing the convergence rates of distributed optimization algorithms is lacking. This paper introduces an energy conservation approach for analyzing continuous-time dynamical systems in dilated coordinates. Instead of directly analyzing dynamics in the original coordinate system, we establish a conserved quantity, akin to physical energy, in the dilated coordinate system. Consequently, convergence rates can be explicitly expressed in terms of the inverse time-dilation factor. Leveraging this generalized approach, we formulate a novel second-order distributed accelerated gradient flow with a convergence rate of $O\left(1/t^{2-\epsilon}\right)$ in time $t$ for $\epsilon&gt;0$. We then employ a semi second-order symplectic Euler discretization to derive a rate-matching algorithm with a convergence rate of $O\left(1/k^{2-\epsilon}\right)$ in $k$ iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the most favorable convergence rate for any distributed optimization algorithm designed for smooth convex optimization. Its accelerated convergence behavior is benchmarked against various state-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms on practical, large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Canonical Correlation Guided Deep Neural Network</title>

Abstract: Learning representations of two views of data such that the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated is appealing in machine learning. In this paper, we present a canonical correlation guided learning framework, which allows to be realized by deep neural networks (CCDNN), to learn such a correlated representation. It is also a novel merging of multivariate analysis (MVA) and machine learning, which can be viewed as transforming MVA into end-to-end architectures with the aid of neural networks. Unlike the linear canonical correlation analysis (CCA), kernel CCA and deep CCA, in the proposed method, the optimization formulation is not restricted to maximize correlation, instead we make canonical correlation as a constraint, which preserves the correlated representation learning ability and focuses more on the engineering tasks endowed by optimization formulation, such as reconstruction, classification and prediction. Furthermore, to reduce the redundancy induced by correlation, a redundancy filter is designed. We illustrate the performance of CCDNN on various tasks. In experiments on MNIST dataset, the results show that CCDNN has better reconstruction performance in terms of mean squared error and mean absolute error than DCCA and DCCAE. Also, we present the application of the proposed network to industrial fault diagnosis and remaining useful life cases for the classification and prediction tasks accordingly. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both tasks when compared to existing methods. Extension of CCDNN to much more deeper with the aid of residual connection is also presented in appendix.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Gradient Estimator for Nonconvex Zeroth-Order Distributed Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates distributed zeroth-order optimization for smooth nonconvex problems. We propose a novel variance-reduced gradient estimator, which randomly renovates one orthogonal direction of the true gradient in each iteration while leveraging historical snapshots for variance correction. By integrating this estimator with gradient tracking mechanism, we address the trade-off between convergence rate and sampling cost per zeroth-order gradient estimation that exists in current zeroth-order distributed optimization algorithms, which rely on either the 2-point or $2d$-point gradient estimators. We derive a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{\frac{5}{2}}/m)$ for smooth nonconvex functions in terms of sampling number $m$ and problem dimension $d$. Numerical simulations comparing our algorithm with existing methods confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed gradient estimator.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Vehicle Dynamics Model Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate dynamic modeling is critical for autonomous racing vehicles, especially during high-speed and agile maneuvers where precise motion prediction is essential for safety. Traditional parameter estimation methods face limitations such as reliance on initial guesses, labor-intensive fitting procedures, and complex testing setups. On the other hand, purely data-driven machine learning methods struggle to capture inherent physical constraints and typically require large datasets for optimal performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Fine-Tuning Hybrid Dynamics (FTHD) method, which integrates supervised and unsupervised Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), combining physics-based modeling with data-driven techniques. FTHD fine-tunes a pre-trained Deep Dynamics Model (DDM) using a smaller training dataset, delivering superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the Deep Pacejka Model (DPM) and outperforming the original DDM. Furthermore, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is embedded within FTHD (EKF-FTHD) to effectively manage noisy real-world data, ensuring accurate denoising while preserving the vehicle's essential physical characteristics. The proposed FTHD framework is validated through scaled simulations using the BayesRace Physics-based Simulator and full-scale real-world experiments from the Indy Autonomous Challenge. Results demonstrate that the hybrid approach significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy, even with reduced data, and outperforms existing models. EKF-FTHD enhances robustness by denoising real-world data while maintaining physical insights, representing a notable advancement in vehicle dynamics modeling for high-speed autonomous racing.</description>

      <title>Obstacle-Aware Quadrupedal Locomotion With Resilient Multi-Modal Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots hold promising potential for applications in navigating cluttered environments with resilience akin to their animal counterparts. However, their floating base configuration makes them vulnerable to real-world uncertainties, yielding substantial challenges in their locomotion control. Deep reinforcement learning has become one of the plausible alternatives for realizing a robust locomotion controller. However, the approaches that rely solely on proprioception sacrifice collision-free locomotion because they require front-feet contact to detect the presence of stairs to adapt the locomotion gait. Meanwhile, incorporating exteroception necessitates a precisely modeled map observed by exteroceptive sensors over a period of time. Therefore, this work proposes a novel method to fuse proprioception and exteroception featuring a resilient multi-modal reinforcement learning. The proposed method yields a controller that showcases agile locomotion performance on a quadrupedal robot over a myriad of real-world courses, including rough terrains, steep slopes, and high-rise stairs, while retaining its robustness against out-of-distribution situations.</description>

      <title>Generating peak-aware pseudo-measurements for low-voltage feeders using metadata of distribution system operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution system operators (DSOs) must cope with new challenges such as the reconstruction of distribution grids along climate neutrality pathways or the ability to manage and control consumption and generation in the grid. In order to meet the challenges, measurements within the distribution grid often form the basis for DSOs. Hence, it is an urgent problem that measurement devices are not installed in many low-voltage (LV) grids. In order to overcome this problem, we present an approach to estimate pseudo-measurements for non-measured LV feeders based on the metadata of the respective feeder using regression models. The feeder metadata comprise information about the number of grid connection points, the installed power of consumers and producers, and billing data in the downstream LV grid. Additionally, we use weather data, calendar data and timestamp information as model features. The existing measurements are used as model target. We extensively evaluate the estimated pseudo-measurements on a large real-world dataset with 2,323 LV feeders characterized by both consumption and feed-in. For this purpose, we introduce peak metrics inspired by the BigDEAL challenge for the peak magnitude, timing and shape for both consumption and feed-in. As regression models, we use XGBoost, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a linear regression (LR). We observe that XGBoost and MLP outperform the LR. Furthermore, the results show that the approach adapts to different weather, calendar and timestamp conditions and produces realistic load curves based on the feeder metadata. In the future, the approach can be adapted to other grid levels like substation transformers and can supplement research fields like load modeling, state estimation and LV load forecasting.</description>

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a significant research area within RL, where integrating constraints with rewards is crucial for enhancing safety and performance across diverse control tasks. In the context of heating systems in the buildings, optimizing the energy efficiency while maintaining the residents' thermal comfort can be intuitively formulated as a constrained optimization problem. However, to solve it with RL may require large amount of data. Therefore, an accurate and versatile simulator is favored. In this paper, we propose a novel building simulator I4B which provides interfaces for different usages and apply a model-free constrained RL algorithm named constrained Soft Actor-Critic with Linear Smoothed Log Barrier function (CSAC-LB) to the heating optimization problem. Benchmarking against baseline algorithms demonstrates CSAC-LB's efficiency in data exploration, constraint satisfaction and performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive event-triggered reinforcement learning control for continuous-time nonlinear systems, subject to bounded uncertainties, characterized by complex interactions. Specifically, the proposed method is capable of jointly learning both the control policy and the communication policy, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computational overhead when learning them separately or only one of them. By augmenting the state space with accrued rewards that represent the performance over the entire trajectory, we show that accurate and efficient determination of triggering conditions is possible without the need for explicit learning triggering conditions, thereby leading to an adaptive non-stationary policy. Finally, we provide several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Generalizability of Graph Neural Networks for Decentralized Unlabeled Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlabeled motion planning involves assigning a set of robots to target locations while ensuring collision avoidance, aiming to minimize the total distance traveled. The problem forms an essential building block for multi-robot systems in applications such as exploration, surveillance, and transportation. We address this problem in a decentralized setting where each robot knows only the positions of its $k$-nearest robots and $k$-nearest targets. This scenario combines elements of combinatorial assignment and continuous-space motion planning, posing significant scalability challenges for traditional centralized approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a decentralized policy learned via a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN enables robots to determine (1) what information to communicate to neighbors and (2) how to integrate received information with local observations for decision-making. We train the GNN using imitation learning with the centralized Hungarian algorithm as the expert policy, and further fine-tune it using reinforcement learning to avoid collisions and enhance performance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The GNN policy trained on 100 robots generalizes to scenarios with up to 500 robots, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by 8.6\% on average and significantly surpassing greedy decentralized methods. This work lays the foundation for solving multi-robot coordination problems in settings where scalability is important.</description>

      <title>Discrete Distributionally Robust Optimal Control with Explicitly Constrained Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimal control (DROC) is gaining interest. This study presents a reformulation method for discrete DROC (DDROC) problems to design optimal control policies under a worst-case distributional uncertainty. The reformulation of DDROC problems impacts both the utility of tractable improvements in continuous DROC problems and the inherent discretization modeling of DROC problems. DROC is believed to have tractability issues; namely, infinite inequalities emerge over the distribution space. Therefore, investigating tractable reformulation methods for these DROC problems is crucial. One such method utilizes the strong dualities of the worst-case expectations. However, previous studies demonstrated that certain non-trivial inequalities remain after the reformulation. To enhance the tractability of DDROC, the proposed method reformulates DDROC problems into one-layer smooth convex programming with only a few trivial inequalities. The proposed method is applied to a DDROC version of a patrol-agent design problem.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Backdoor Threats to Large Language Models: Advancement and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various domains, including Web search, healthcare, and software development. However, as these models scale, they become more vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, particularly backdoor attacks. By exploiting the potent memorization capacity of LLMs, adversaries can easily inject backdoors into LLMs by manipulating a small portion of training data, leading to malicious behaviors in downstream applications whenever the hidden backdoor is activated by the pre-defined triggers. Moreover, emerging learning paradigms like instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) exacerbate these risks as they rely heavily on crowdsourced data and human feedback, which are not fully controlled. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of emerging backdoor threats to LLMs that appear during LLM development or inference, and cover recent advancement in both defense and detection strategies for mitigating backdoor threats to LLMs. We also outline key challenges in addressing these threats, highlighting areas for future research.</description>

      <title>Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of mixed $\mathit{H}_2/\mathit{H}_\infty$ control in the infinite-horizon setting. We identify the optimal causal controller that minimizes the $\mathit{H}_2$ cost of the closed-loop system subject to an $\mathit{H}_\infty$ constraint. Megretski proved that the optimal mixed $\mathit{H}_2/\mathit{H}_\infty$ controller is non-rational whenever the constraint is active without giving an explicit construction of the controller. In this work, we provide the first exact closed-form solution to the infinite-horizon mixed $\mathit{H}_2/\mathit{H}_\infty$ control in the frequency domain. While the optimal controller is non-rational, our formulation provides a finite-dimensional parameterization of the optimal controller. Leveraging this fact, we introduce an efficient iterative algorithm that finds the optimal causal controller in the frequency domain. We show that this algorithm is convergent when the system is scalar and present numerical evidence for exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we show how to find the best (in $\mathit{H}_\infty$ norm) fixed-order rational approximations of the optimal mixed $\mathit{H}_2/\mathit{H}_\infty$ controller and study its performance.</description>

      <title>A Parallel-in-Time Newton's Method for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful framework for optimal control of dynamical systems. However, MPC solvers suffer from a high computational burden that restricts their application to systems with low sampling frequency. This issue is further amplified in nonlinear and constrained systems that require nesting MPC solvers within iterative procedures. In this paper, we address these issues by developing parallel-in-time algorithms for constrained nonlinear optimization problems that take advantage of massively parallel hardware to achieve logarithmic computational time scaling over the planning horizon. We develop time-parallel second-order solvers based on interior point methods and the alternating direction method of multipliers, leveraging fast convergence and lower computational cost per iteration. The parallelization is based on a reformulation of the subproblems in terms of associative operations that can be parallelized using the associative scan algorithm. We validate our approach on numerical examples of nonlinear and constrained dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Stable LLM Training in Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As mobile devices increasingly become focal points for advanced applications, edge computing presents a viable solution to their inherent computational limitations, particularly in deploying large language models (LLMs). However, despite the advancements in edge computing, significant challenges remain in efficient training and deploying LLMs due to the computational demands and data privacy concerns associated with these models. This paper explores a collaborative training framework that integrates mobile users with edge servers to optimize resource allocation, thereby enhancing both performance and efficiency. Our approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, allowing mobile users to adjust the initial layers of the LLM while edge servers handle the more demanding latter layers. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption and delay during training. We also address the common issue of instability in model performance by incorporating stability enhancements into our objective function. Through novel fractional programming technique, we achieve a stationary point for the formulated problem. Simulations demonstrate that our method reduces the energy consumption as well as the latency, and increases the reliability of LLMs across various mobile settings.</description>

      <title>Controlling sharpness, SNR and SAR for 3D FSE at 7T by end-to-end learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To non-heuristically identify dedicated variable flip angle (VFA) schemes optimized for the point-spread function (PSF) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multiple tissues in 3D FSE sequences with very long echo trains at 7T. Methods: The proposed optimization considers predefined SAR constraints and target contrast using an end-to-end learning framework. The cost function integrates components for contrast fidelity (SNR) and a penalty term to minimize image blurring (PSF) for multiple tissues. By adjusting the weights of PSF/SNR cost-function components, PSF- and SNR-optimized VFAs were derived and tested in vivo using both the open-source Pulseq standard on two volunteers as well as vendor protocols on a 7T MRI system with parallel transmit extension on three volunteers. Results: PSF-optimized VFAs resulted in significantly reduced image blurring compared to standard VFAs for T2w while maintaining contrast fidelity. Small white and gray matter structures, as well as blood vessels, are more visible with PSF-optimized VFAs. Quantitative analysis shows that the optimized VFA yields 50% less deviation from a sinc-like reference PSF than the standard VFA. The SNR-optimized VFAs yielded images with significantly improved SNR in a white and gray matter region relative to standard (81.2\pm18.4 vs. 41.2\pm11.5, respectively) as trade-off for elevated image blurring. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of end-to-end learning frameworks to optimize VFA schemes in very long echo trains for 3D FSE acquisition at 7T in terms of PSF and SNR. It paves the way for fast and flexible adjustment of the trade-off between PSF and SNR for 3D FSE.</description>

      <title>Design, manufacturing, and inverse dynamic modeling of soft parallel robots actuated by dielectric elastomer actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft parallel robots with their manipulation safety and low commercial cost show a promising future for delicate operations and safe human-robot interactions. However, promoting the use of electroactive polymers (EAPs) is still challenging due to the under-improving quality of the product and the dynamic modelling of the collaborations between multiple actuators. This article presents the design, fabrication, modelling and control of a parallel kinematics Delta robot actuated by dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs). The trade-off between the actuation force and stroke is retaken by an angular stroke amplification mechanism, and the weight of the robot frame is reduced by utilizing 3D puzzling strip structures. A generic way of constructing a high-stability conductive paint on a silicon-based film has been achieved by laser scanning the DE-film and then sandwiching a conductive particle-based electrode with a paint which is mixed by the particles and photosensitive resin. Compared to the wildly used carbon grease, the fabricated electrode shows a higher consistency in its dynamic behaviour before and after the on-stand test. Finally, to predict the output force and inverse motion of the robot end effector, we constructed the inverse dynamic model by introducing an expanded Bergstrom-Boyce model to the constitutive behavior of the dielectric film. The experimental results show a prediction of robot output force with RSME of 12.4% when the end effector remains stationary, and a well-followed trajectory with less than RSME 2.5%.</description>

      <title>Visual collective behaviors on spherical robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implementation of collective motion, traditionally, disregard the limited sensing capabilities of an individual, to instead assuming an omniscient perception of the environment. This study implements a visual flocking model in a ``robot-in-the-loop'' approach to reproduce these behaviors with a flock composed of 10 independent spherical robots. The model achieves robotic collective motion by only using panoramic visual information of each robot, such as retinal position, optical size and optic flow of the neighboring robots. We introduce a virtual anchor to confine the collective robotic movements so to avoid wall interactions. For the first time, a simple visual robot-in-the-loop approach succeed in reproducing several collective motion phases, in particular, swarming, and milling. Another milestone achieved with by this model is bridging the gap between simulation and physical experiments by demonstrating nearly identical behaviors in both environments with the same visual model. To conclude, we show that our minimal visual collective motion model is sufficient to recreate most collective behaviors on a robot-in-the-loop system that is scalable, behaves as numerical simulations predict and is easily comparable to traditional models.</description>

      <title>Continuously Improving Mobile Manipulation with Autonomous Real-World RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully autonomous real-world RL framework for mobile manipulation that can learn policies without extensive instrumentation or human supervision. This is enabled by 1) task-relevant autonomy, which guides exploration towards object interactions and prevents stagnation near goal states, 2) efficient policy learning by leveraging basic task knowledge in behavior priors, and 3) formulating generic rewards that combine human-interpretable semantic information with low-level, fine-grained observations. We demonstrate that our approach allows Spot robots to continually improve their performance on a set of four challenging mobile manipulation tasks, obtaining an average success rate of 80% across tasks, a 3-4 improvement over existing approaches.

      <title>Sufficient Conditions on Bipartite Consensus of Weakly Connected Matrix-weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in bipartite consensus, a scenario where agents are divided into two disjoint sets with agents in the same set agreeing on a certain value and those in different sets agreeing on opposite or specifically related values, have highlighted its potential applications across various fields. Traditional research typically relies on the presence of a positive-negative spanning tree, which limits the practical applicability of bipartite consensus. This study relaxes that assumption by allowing for weak connectivity within the network, where paths can be weighted by semidefinite matrices. By exploring the algebraic constraints imposed by positive-negative trees and semidefinite paths, we derive sufficient conditions for achieving bipartite consensus. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Safety Control of Uncertain MIMO Systems Using Dynamic Output Feedback Barrier Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety control of dynamical systems using barrier functions relies on knowing the full state information. This paper introduces a novel approach for safety control in uncertain MIMO systems with partial state information. The proposed method combines the synthesis of a vector norm barrier function and a dynamic output feedback safety controller to ensure robust safety enforcement. The safety controller guarantees the invariance of the barrier function under uncertain dynamics and disturbances. To address the challenges associated with safety verification using partial state information, a barrier function estimator is developed. This estimator employs an identifier-based state estimator to obtain a state estimate that is affine in the uncertain model parameters of the system. By incorporating a priori knowledge of the limits of the uncertain model parameters and disturbances, the state estimate provides a robust upper bound for the barrier function. Comparative analysis with existing control barrier function based methods shows the advantage of the proposed approach in enforcing safety constraints under tight input constraints and the utilization of estimated state information.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Opinion Dynamics under Social Pressure in Arbitrary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social pressure is a key factor affecting the evolution of opinions on networks in many types of settings, pushing people to conform to their neighbors' opinions. To study this, the interacting Polya urn model was introduced by Jadbabaie et al., in which each agent has two kinds of opinion: inherent beliefs, which are hidden from the other agents and fixed; and declared opinions, which are randomly sampled at each step from a distribution which depends on the agent's inherent belief and her neighbors' past declared opinions (the social pressure component), and which is then communicated to her neighbors. Each agent also has a bias parameter denoting her level of resistance to social pressure. At every step, each agent updates her declared opinion (simultaneously with all other agents) according to her neighbors' aggregate past declared opinions, her inherent belief, and her bias parameter. We study the asymptotic behavior of this opinion dynamics model and show that the agents' declaration probabilities approaches a set of equilibrium points of the expected dynamics using Lyapunov theory and stochastic approximation techniques. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the agents to approach consensus on their declared opinions. Our work provides further insight into the difficulty of inferring the inherent beliefs of agents when they are under social pressure.</description>

      <title>Robust Multivariate Detection and Estimation with Fault Frequency Content Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of fault detection and estimation (FDE) for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with a particular focus on frequency content information of faults, possibly as multiple disjoint continuum ranges, and under both disturbances and stochastic noise. To ensure the worst-case fault sensitivity in the considered frequency ranges and mitigate the effects of disturbances and noise, an optimization framework incorporating a mixed H_/H2 performance index is developed to compute the optimal detection filter. Moreover, a thresholding rule is proposed to guarantee both the false alarm rate (FAR) and the fault detection rate (FDR). Next, shifting attention to fault estimation in specific frequency ranges, an exact reformulation of the optimal estimation filter design using the restricted Hinf performance index is derived, which is inherently non-convex. However, focusing on finite frequency samples and fixed poles, a lower bound is established via a highly tractable quadratic programming (QP) problem. This lower bound together with an alternating optimization (AO) approach to the original estimation problem leads to a suboptimality gap for the overall estimation filter design. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is validated through applications of a non-minimum phase hydraulic turbine system and a multi-area power system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic gears offer advantages over mechanical gears, including contactless power transfer, but require robust analysis tools for optimization and commercialization. This study proposes a rapid and accurate 2D nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model for radial flux magnetic gears (RFMG). The model, featuring a parameterized gear geometry and adjustable flux tube distribution, accommodates nonlinear effects like magnetic saturation while maintaining quick simulation times. Comparison with a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) model demonstrates the MEC's accuracy in torque and flux density predictions across diverse designs. Additionally, a parametric optimization study of 140,000 designs confirms the MEC's high accuracy, achieving close agreement with FEA torque predictions, with simulations running up to 100 times faster. Finally, the MEC shows good agreement with 2D FEA for a prototype RFMG.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-time Cooperative Output Regulation of Linear Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite-time protocol for a multi-agent systems (MASs) can guarantee the convergence of every agent in a finite time interval in contrast to the asymptotic convergence, but the settling time depends on the initial condition and design parameters and is inconsistent across the agents. In this paper, we study the prescribed-time cooperative output regulation (PTCOR) problem for a class of linear heterogeneous MASs under a directed communication graph, where the settling time of every agent can be specified a priori and thus consistent. As a special case of PTCOR, the necessary and sufficient condition for prescribed-time output regulation of an individual system is first discussed. Then, the PTCOR problem is converted into two cascaded subsystem, where the first one composed of distributed estimate errors and local estimate errors and the second one is for local tracking errors.
  The criterion for prescribed-time stabilization of the cascaded system is proposed and is found to be different from that of traditional asymptotic stabilization of a cascaded system. Under the criterion and sufficient condition, the general PTCOR problem is studied in two scenarios including state feedback control and measurement output feedback control. In particular, a distributed prescribed-time observer for each subsystem is explicitly constructed to estimate the exosystem's state. Based on the observer, a distributed controller is proposed to achieve convergence of the regulated output to zero within a prescribed-time.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Equitable Load Shedding: Real-time Solution via Learning Binding Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely and effective load shedding in power systems is critical for maintaining supply-demand balance and preventing cascading blackouts. To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economical and equity considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering equitable and real-time load shedding decisions.</description>

      <title>Relax, Estimate, and Track: a Simple Battery State-of-charge and State-of-health Estimation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery management is a critical component of ubiquitous battery-powered energy systems, in which battery state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimations are of crucial importance. Conventional SOC and SOH estimation methods, especially model-based methods, often lack accurate modeling of the open circuit voltage (OCV), have relatively high computational complexity, and lack theoretical analysis. This study introduces a simple SOC and SOH estimation method that overcomes all these weaknesses. The key idea of the proposed method is to momentarily set the cell's current to zero for a few minutes during the charging, perform SOC and SOH estimation based on the measured data, and continue tracking the cell's SOC afterward. The method is based on rigorous theoretical analysis, requires no hyperparameter fine-tuning, and is hundreds of times faster than conventional model-based methods. The method is validated on six batteries charged at different C rates and temperatures, realizing fast and accurate estimations under various conditions, with a SOH root mean square error (RMSE) of around 3% and a SOC RMSE of around 1.5%.</description>

      <title>Robust Backstepping Control of a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Under Colored Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in software and hardware technologies have facilitated the production of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Quadrotor UAVs are used in important missions such as search and rescue, counter terrorism, firefighting, surveillance and cargo transportation. While performing these tasks, quadrotors must operate in noisy environments. Therefore, a robust controller design that can control the altitude and attitude of the quadrotor in noisy environments is of great importance. While many researchers focus only on white Gaussian noise in their studies, all colored noises should be considered during quadrotor's operation. In this study, it is aimed to design a robust controller that is resistant to all colored noises. Firstly, a nonlinear model of the quadrotor was created with MATLAB. Then, a backstepping control design that is resistant to colored noises was realized. The designed backstepping controller was tested under Gaussian white noise, pink noise, brown noise, blue noise and purple noise. PID and Lyapunov-based controller designs were also carried out and their time responses (rise time, overshoot, settling time) were compared with those of backstepping controller. When the values obtained was examined, it was proven that the proposed backstepping controller had the least overshoot and shortest settling time under all noise types.</description>

      <title>Combining Switching Mechanism with Re-Initialization and Anomaly Detection for Resiliency of Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) play a pivotal role in numerous critical real-world applications that have stringent requirements for safety. To enhance the CPS resiliency against attacks, redundancy can be integrated in real-time controller implementations by designing strategies that switch among multiple controllers. However, existing switching strategies typically overlook remediation measures for compromised controllers, opting instead to simply exclude them. Such a solution reduces the CPS redundancy since only a subset of controllers are used. To address this gap, this work proposes a multi-controller switching strategy with periodic re-initialization to remove attacks. Controllers that finish re-initialization can be reused by the switching strategy, preserving the CPS redundancy and resiliency. The proposed switching strategy is designed to ensure that at each switching moment, a controller that has just completed re-initialization is available, minimizing the likelihood of compromise. Additionally, the controller's working period decreases with the number of involved controllers, reducing the controller's exposure time to attacks. An anomaly detector is used to detect CPS attacks during the controller's working period. Upon alarm activation, the current control signal is set to a predefined value, and a switch to an alternative controller occurs at the earliest switching moment. Our switching strategy is shown to be still effective even if the anomaly detector fails to detect (stealthy) attacks.</description>

      <title>RL + Model-based Control: Using On-demand Optimal Control to Learn Versatile Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17842v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a control framework that combines model-based optimal control and reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve versatile and robust legged locomotion. Our approach enhances the RL training process by incorporating on-demand reference motions generated through finite-horizon optimal control, covering a broad range of velocities and gaits. These reference motions serve as targets for the RL policy to imitate, leading to the development of robust control policies that can be learned with reliability. Furthermore, by utilizing realistic simulation data that captures whole-body dynamics, RL effectively overcomes the inherent limitations in reference motions imposed by modeling simplifications. We validate the robustness and controllability of the RL training process within our framework through a series of experiments. In these experiments, our method showcases its capability to generalize reference motions and effectively handle more complex locomotion tasks that may pose challenges for the simplified model, thanks to RL's flexibility. Additionally, our framework effortlessly supports the training of control policies for robots with diverse dimensions, eliminating the necessity for robot-specific adjustments in the reward function and hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Active Inverse Learning in Stackelberg Trajectory Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic inverse learning is the problem of inferring a player's objectives from their actions. We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating System-Level Anomalies of Vision-Based Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, have made significant strides in recent years by leveraging visual inputs and machine learning for decision-making and control. Despite their impressive performance, these vision-based controllers can make erroneous predictions when faced with novel or out-of-distribution inputs. Such errors can cascade to catastrophic system failures and compromise system safety. In this work, we introduce a run-time anomaly monitor to detect and mitigate such closed-loop, system-level failures. Specifically, we leverage a reachability-based framework to stress-test the vision-based controller offline and mine its system-level failures. This data is then used to train a classifier that is leveraged online to flag inputs that might cause system breakdowns. The anomaly detector highlights issues that transcend individual modules and pertain to the safety of the overall system. We also design a fallback controller that robustly handles these detected anomalies to preserve system safety. We validate the proposed approach on an autonomous aircraft taxiing system that uses a vision-based controller for taxiing. Our results show the efficacy of the proposed approach in identifying and handling system-level anomalies, outperforming methods such as prediction error-based detection, and ensembling, thereby enhancing the overall safety and robustness of autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Path Planning in Large Unknown Environments with Switchable System Models for Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large environments are challenging for path planning algorithms as the size of the configuration space increases. Furthermore, if the environment is mainly unexplored, large amounts of the path are planned through unknown areas. Hence, a complete replanning of the entire path occurs whenever the path collides with newly discovered obstacles. We propose a novel method that stops the path planning algorithm after a certain distance. It is used to navigate the algorithm in large environments and is not prone to problems of existing navigation approaches. Furthermore, we developed a method to detect significant environment changes to allow a more efficient replanning. At last, we extend the path planner to be used in the U-Shift concept vehicle. It can switch to another system model and rotate around the center of its rear axis. The results show that the proposed methods generate nearly identical paths compared to the standard Hybrid A* while drastically reducing the execution time. Furthermore, we show that the extended path planning algorithm enables the efficient use of the maneuvering capabilities of the concept vehicle to plan concise paths in narrow environments.</description>

      <title>CARTOS: A Charging-Aware Real-Time Operating System for Intermittent Batteryless Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents CARTOS, a charging-aware real-time operating system designed to enhance the functionality of intermittently-powered batteryless devices (IPDs) for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. While IPDs offer significant advantages such as extended lifespan and operability in extreme environments, they pose unique challenges, including the need to ensure forward progress of program execution amidst variable energy availability and maintaining reliable real-time time behavior during power disruptions. To address these challenges, CARTOS introduces a mixed-preemption scheduling model that classifies tasks into computational and peripheral tasks, and ensures their efficient and timely execution by adopting just-in-time checkpointing for divisible computation tasks and uninterrupted execution for indivisible peripheral tasks. CARTOS also supports processing chains of tasks with precedence constraints and adapts its scheduling in response to environmental changes to offer continuous execution under diverse conditions. CARTOS is implemented with new APIs and components added to FreeRTOS but is designed for portability to other embedded RTOSs. Through real hardware experiments and simulations, CARTOS exhibits superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that it can serve as a practical platform for developing resilient, real-time sensing applications on IPDs.</description>

      <title>Complete and Near-Optimal Robotic Crack Coverage and Filling in Civil Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simultaneous sensor-based inspection and footprint coverage (SIFC) planning and control design with applications to autonomous robotic crack mapping and filling. The main challenge of the SIFC problem lies in the coupling of complete sensing (for mapping) and robotic footprint (for filling) coverage tasks. Initially, we assume known target information (e.g., cracks) and employ classic cell decomposition methods to achieve complete sensing coverage of the workspace and complete robotic footprint coverage using the least-cost route. Subsequently, we generalize the algorithm to handle unknown target information, allowing the robot to scan and incrementally construct the target map online while conducting robotic footprint coverage. The online polynomial-time SIFC planning algorithm minimizes the total robot traveling distance, guarantees complete sensing coverage of the entire workspace, and achieves near-optimal robotic footprint coverage, as demonstrated through experiments. For the demonstrated application, we design coordinated nozzle motion control with the planned robot trajectory to efficiently fill all cracks within the robot's footprint. Experimental results illustrate the algorithm's design, performance, and comparisons. The SIFC algorithm offers a high-efficiency motion planning solution for various robotic applications requiring simultaneous sensing and actuation coverage.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the distributed broadcast problem within the context of network communications, a critical challenge in decentralized information dissemination. We put forth a novel hypergraph-based approach to address this issue, focusing on minimizing the number of broadcasts to ensure comprehensive data sharing among all network users. The key contributions of this work include the establishment of a general lower bound for the problem using the min-cut capacity of hypergraphs, and a distributed broadcast for quasi-trees (DBQT) algorithm tailored for the unique structure of quasi-trees, which is proven to be optimal. This paper advances both network communication strategies and hypergraph theory, with implications for a wide range of real-world applications, from vehicular and sensor networks to distributed storage systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Navigation of a Robotic Fish Swimming Across the Vortical Flow Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating efficiently across vortical flow fields presents a significant challenge in various robotic applications. The dynamic and unsteady nature of vortical flows often disturbs the control of underwater robots, complicating their operation in hydrodynamic environments. Conventional control methods, which depend on accurate modeling, fail in these settings due to the complexity of fluid-structure interactions (FSI) caused by unsteady hydrodynamics. This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, trained in a data-driven manner, to enable efficient navigation of a robotic fish swimming across vortical flows. Our proposed algorithm incorporates the LSTM architecture and uses several recent consecutive observations as the state to address the issue of partial observation, often due to sensor limitations. We present a numerical study of navigation within a Karman vortex street, created by placing a stationary cylinder in a uniform flow, utilizing the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). The aim is to train the robotic fish to discover efficient navigation policies, enabling it to reach a designated target point across the Karman vortex street from various initial positions. After training, the fish demonstrates the ability to rapidly reach the target from different initial positions, showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm. Analysis of the results reveals that the robotic fish can leverage velocity gains and pressure differences induced by the vortices to reach the target, underscoring the potential of our proposed algorithm in enhancing navigation in complex hydrodynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Adaptive Bitrate Algorithms for Virtual Reality Streaming over Wi-Fi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive Virtual Reality (VR) streaming over Wi-Fi networks encounters significant challenges due to bandwidth fluctuations caused by channel contention and user mobility. Adaptive BitRate (ABR) algorithms dynamically adjust the video encoding bitrate based on the available network capacity, aiming to maximize image quality while mitigating congestion and preserving the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we experiment with ABR algorithms for VR streaming using Air Light VR (ALVR), an open-source VR streaming solution. We extend ALVR with a comprehensive set of metrics that provide a robust characterization of the network's state, enabling more informed bitrate adjustments. To demonstrate the utility of these performance indicators, we develop and test the Network-aware Step-wise ABR algorithm for VR streaming (NeSt-VR). Results validate the accuracy of the newly implemented network performance metrics and demonstrate NeSt-VR's video bitrate adaptation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Fast Robust Monitoring for Signal Temporal Logic with Value Freezing Operators (STL*)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers have previously proposed augmenting Signal Temporal Logic (STL) with the value freezing operator in order to express engineering properties that cannot be expressed in STL. This augmented logic is known as STL*. The previous algorithms for STL* monitoring were intractable, and did not scale formulae with nested freeze variables. We present offline discrete-time monitoring algorithms with an acceleration heuristic, both for Boolean monitoring as well as for quantitative robustness monitoring. The acceleration heuristic operates over time intervals where subformulae hold true, rather than over the original trace sample-points. We present experimental validation of our algorithms, the results show that our algorithms can monitor over long traces for formulae with two or three nested freeze variables.
  Our work is the first work with monitoring algorithm implementations for STL* formulae with nested freeze variables.</description>

      <title>iWalker: Imperative Visual Planning for Walking Humanoid Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, with the potential to perform a broad range of tasks in environments designed for humans, have been deemed crucial for the basis of general AI agents. When talking about planning and controlling, although traditional models and task-specific methods have been extensively studied over the past few decades, they are inadequate for achieving the flexibility and versatility needed for general autonomy. Learning approaches, especially reinforcement learning, are powerful and popular nowadays, but they are inherently "blind" during training, relying heavily on trials in simulation without proper guidance from physical principles or underlying dynamics. In response, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline that seamlessly integrates perception, planning, and model-based control for humanoid robot walking. We refer to our method as iWalker, which is driven by imperative learning (IL), a self-supervising neuro-symbolic learning framework. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, significantly improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. In experiments, iWalker demonstrates effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward versatile and autonomous humanoid robots.</description>
