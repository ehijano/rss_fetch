      <title>Programmable photonic waveguide arrays: opportunities and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of programmable photonics has advanced significantly in recent decades, driven by the rising demand for complex applications, such as optical quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, as the complexity of these applications increases, there is an increasing need for novel designs that enhance circuit transmission and enable further miniaturization. Photonic waveguide arrays (WAs) hold a unique position in integrated photonics, as they implement ``always-on'' Hamiltonians and have no direct analogs in free-space optics. They find applications in various fields, including light propagation studies, quantum walks, and topological photonics. Despite their versatility, the lack of reconfigurability has limited their utility and hindered further advancements for a long time. Recently, programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs) have emerged as a promising solution for overcoming the limitations of static WAs and PWA-based architectures have been proven to be universal. This perspective proposes a vision for photonic circuits based on PWAs as a new, interdisciplinary field. We review the history of the development of PWAs and outline their potential in areas such as simulation, communication, sensing, and classical and quantum information processing. This technology is expected to become increasingly feasible with advancements in programmable photonics, nanofabrication, and quantum control.</description>

      <title>Gigahertz- and mmWave-repetition-rate soliton microcombs on X-cut lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs are a cornerstone of integrated frequency comb technologies, with applications spanning photonic computing, ranging, microwave synthesis, optical communications, and quantum light generation. In nearly all such applications, electro-optic (EO) components play a critical role in generating, monitoring, stabilizing, and modulating the solitons. Towards building photonic integrated circuits for next-generation applications, that will simultaneously maximize system performance and minimize size, weight, and power consumption metrics, achieving soliton microcombs and efficient EO modulation on a chip is essential. X-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a leading photonic platform for the realization of high-performance integrated EO devices and systems. However, despite extensive research, soliton microcombs have remained elusive to X-cut TFLN due to its multiple strong Raman-active modes, in-plane refractive index anisotropy, and photorefractive effects. Here, we address this long-standing challenge and demonstrate versatile soliton microcombs on X-cut TFLN, with repetition-rates spanning from the gigahertz (~26 GHz) up to the millimeter-wave (~0.156 THz) regime. Our finding broadly advances both the fundamental science and practical applications of integrated comb sources by enabling efficient EO modulation and broadband coherent solitons to be monolithically combined on the same chip.</description>

      <title>Harmonics-assisted optical phase amplification with a self-mixing thin-slice Nd:GdVO4 laser operating in the self-induced skew cosh Gaussian mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic-assisted phase amplification was achieved in a 300-micrometer-thick Nd:GdVO4 laser in the self-mixing interference scheme. The key event is the self-induced skew cosh Gaussian (e.g., skew-chG) mode oscillation in a thin-slice solid-state laser with wide-aperture laser-diode pumping. The skew-chG mode was proved to be formed by the phase-locking of nearly frequency-degenerate TEM00 and annular fields. The resultant modal-interference-induced gain modulation at the beat frequency between the two modal fields, which is far above the relaxation oscillation frequency, increased experimental self-mixing modulation bandwidth accordingly. Fifty-fold phase amplification was achieved in a strong optical feedback regime.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of bulk Fermi arc in single dielectric resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk Fermi arc is a fundamental non-Hermitian topological feature that connects two exceptional points (EPs), featuring the transition between Hermitian and non-Hermitian worlds. The bulk Fermi arc emerges when losses are introduced into a Hermitian system, causing a Dirac point to split into two EPs, where both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions coalesce. Although theoretically predicted in various systems, experimental confirmation has been limited to a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab. Here, we present the first experimental observation of a bulk Fermi arc in a single dielectric resonator. Specifically, we consider a ring resonator made of high-refractive index ceramic. The inner radius and height are varied, enabling the observation of a two-sheeted Riemann surface with two EPs connected by a bulk Fermi arc, confirmed through numerical calculations and experimentally measured extinction spectra at GHz frequencies. These results establish dielectric resonators as a powerful platform for investigating non-Hermitian topological physics and open new avenues for designing topologically robust photonic devices and EP-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Directional optical parametric amplification in a hyperbolic metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical parametric amplification (OPA) comprises essentially a nonlinear four-wave mixing process in which a "pump" and a "signal" field give rise to an "idler" field under certain phase-matching conditions. Here we use a photonic crystal waveguide strongly-coupled with an excitonic reservoir to generate this process between different guided modes at optical wavelengths. Differently from classical nonlinear optical crystals, where the pump and idler photons travel almost collinearly, our exciton-polaritons are naturally separated in the waveguide due to their opposite group velocities. Due to the high efficiency of the process we can generate the idler field of the parametric process by pumping with a continuous wave laser and choose its direction of propagation in the waveguide by adjusting the angle of incidence of the seed laser. We show the OPA process to be robust against surface defects of the waveguide and can lead to simple-to-fabricate devices compared to microcavities that take advantage of strong signal-idler correlations in a propagating geometry. Our results closely agree with mean-field numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Automatically setting arbitrary magnitude and phase of Mach-Zehnder interferometers for scalable optical computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12869v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on an automated control strategy to set and stabilize a 2x2 integrated optical gate implemented with a balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The control strategy reliably configures the gate in any desired working point without any prior calibration or complex algorithm for the correction of hardware non-idealities. It has been tested on a multistage silicon photonic chip comprising a coherent input vector generator, the 2x2 gate used as matrix-vector multiplier and a coherent receiver for phase measurement. By leveraging the presence of transparent photodiodes in key positions, precise control of light beams in any point of the circuit is obtained, which translates into a resolution in the computation of the matrix-vector product of 7.2 and 8.5 bits for the output power and phase, respectively. High accuracy, robustness against non-idealities and stability over long-term operation, ensured by the feedback-controlled architecture, provide scalability towards optical processors of any size. Additionally, the possibility of using the MZI both as computing gate and phase validation unit avoids propagation of programming errors, solving a significant issue of coherent optical computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Confined Electromagnetic Waves in Media Composed of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are quantum materials combining insulating bulk properties with conductive surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry. Their unique electromagnetic behavior originates from the topological magnetoelectric effect encoded in an axion-like $\theta$-term ($\theta$ = $\pi$ mod 2$\pi$). This $\theta$-electrodynamics modifies Maxwell's equations specifically at material interfaces through altered boundary conditions, preserving conventional bulk electrodynamics while enabling surface-mediated optical effects like polarization rotation and hybrid wave modes.
  This thesis explores electromagnetic wave confinement in TI-based waveguides. Key advances include: (1) Controlled modification of reactive and dissipated energies through polarization engineering in waveguide geometries; (2) Experimental realization of transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves violating Earnshaw's theorem via $\theta$ discontinuities in coaxial TI structures, demonstrating unique polarization rotation mechanisms and low-loss propagation through bent fibers; (3) TEM wave confinement with fewer than two conductors using imaginary $\theta$ parameters, explained through self-consistent surface charge dynamics; (4) First-principles identification of hybrid TE-TM modes in TI slab waveguides, contrasting with conventional magnetoelectric material responses. These findings establish how surface boundary condition modifications from $\theta$ enable new electromagnetic solutions despite unchanged bulk equations.
  The demonstrated phenomena -- including modified propagation modes, non-trivial polarization dynamics, and unconventional confinement -- suggest photonic applications in polarization control and optical routing. By connecting topological electrodynamics with waveguide physics, this work provides both fundamental insights and practical design principles for topological photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Second Harmonic Generation in Monolayer WS2 by Feedback-Based Wavefront Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) are of great interest for second harmonic (SH) generation due to their large second-order susceptibility, atomically thin structure, and relaxed phase-matching conditions. TMDs are also promising candidates for miniaturizing nonlinear optical devices due to their versatile applications in photon manipulation, quantum emission and sensing, and nanophotonic circuits. However, their strong SH response is limited by nanometer-scale light-matter interaction and material impurities. Although there is considerable work towards engineering TMDs for enhancing their nonlinear responses, all-optical methods are still in the exploration stages. In this work, we incorporate, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental demonstrations of feedback-based wavefront shaping (WFS) techniques in atomically thin media to reveal and enhance the weak SH generation of monolayer WS2. Phase tuning of the incident wavefront leads to localized regions of high-intensity fundamental light, increasing the intensity of SH generation by up to an order of magnitude in targeted regions. We enhance the local conversion efficiencies from monolayer WS2 up to 41 times from phase-only modulation. Furthermore, by introducing a shift in the transverse phase structure, we generate observable SH generation at the destructively interfering grain boundaries of polycrystalline monolayers. This method allows for all-optical tuning of TMDs nonlinear responses, opening up possibilities for dynamic signal routing and on-demand enhancement in nanoscale photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12358v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce wavefront shaping as a tool for optimizing the sensitivity in nano-optomechanical measurement schemes. We perform multimode output analysis of an optomechanical system consisting of a focused laser beam coupled to the transverse motion of a tapered cantilever, and demonstrate that wavefront shaping enables a 350-fold enhancement of the measurement signal-to-noise (+25.5 dB) compared to standard split-detection, close to the quantum precision limit. Our results open new perspectives in terms of sensitivity and control of the optomechanical interaction.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced spectroscopy in the deep cryogenic regime -- new hydrogen technologies for quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectrometers based on high-finesse optical cavities have proven to be powerful tools for applied and fundamental studies. Extending this technology to the deep cryogenic regime is beneficial in many ways: Doppler broadening is reduced, peak absorption is enhanced, the Boltzmann distribution of rotational states is narrowed, all unwanted molecular species disturbing the spectra are frozen out, and dense spectra of complex polyatomic molecules become easier to assign. We demonstrate a cavity-enhanced spectrometer fully operating in the deep cryogenic regime down to 4 K. We solved several technological challenges that allowed us to uniformly cool not only the sample but also the entire cavity, including the mirrors and cavity length actuator, which ensures the thermodynamic equilibrium of a gas sample. Our technology well isolates the cavity from external noise and cryocooler vibrations. This instrument enables a variety of fundamental and practical applications. We demonstrate a few examples based on accurate spectroscopy of cryogenic hydrogen molecules: accurate test of the quantum electrodynamics for molecules; realization of the primary SI standards for temperature, concentration and pressure in the deep cryogenic regime; measurement of the H$_{2}$ phase diagram; and determination of the ortho-para spin isomer conversion rate.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Multilayered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a single layer placed in the middle of the optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation in the cavity quantization direction. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multilayered materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a {\it bright layer} description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayer material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical approaches for wavefront shaping traditionally rely on phase modulation through holographic techniques. Shaping the phase determines a wave's diffraction and hence its intensity distribution in space. We instead show that shaping the polarization introduces a novel framework that permits the spatial modulation of polarization to control wavefront propagation and resulting amplitude distributions. We develop two distinct computational phase retrieval approaches for calculating the required polarization transformations and experimentally validate these. The first method extends the established Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, while the second employs machine learning optimization to determine optimal polarization patterns. By implementing both amplitude and polarization control simultaneously using a single polarization mask, our approach significantly reduces system complexity compared to traditional methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the potential of polarization-based wavefront shaping as an efficient alternative to conventional techniques, paving the way for applications in optical manipulation and imaging.</description>

Abstract: A novel, copper-based plasmonic system is presented to provide optical to microwave photon conversion. The process uses highly excited levels in Cu2O Rydberg excitons and takes advantage of spoof plasmons, which allow for significant enhancement of the transition probability between specific excitonic energy levels. The theoretical results are verified with numerical simulations. The proposed system is very flexible, allowing for emission of microwaves wavelength from 0.1 mm to 10 mm.</description>

Abstract: Combining the microscopic calculation of superlattice minibands and the macroscopic real density matrix approach one can obtain electric susceptibilities of the superlattice system irradiated by an electromagnetical wave. It is shown how to compute the dispersion relation, excitonic resonances positions and susceptibility of Cu$_2$O/MgO based superlattice (SL), when Rydberg Exciton-Polaritons appear, including the effect of the coherence between the electron-hole pair and the electromagnetic field and the polaritonic effect. Using the Kronig-Penney model for computing miniband SL parameters the analytical expressions for optical functions are obtained and the numerical calculations for Cu$_2$O/MgO SL are performed.</description>

      <title>$\textit{In vivo}$ fundus imaging and computational refocusing with a diffuser-based fundus camera</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significance: Access to diagnostic eye care could be expanded with high-throughput and easy-to-use tools. Phase mask-based imaging may improve the fundus camera by enabling computational refocusing with no moving parts. While phase mask-based imaging has been demonstrated in a model eye, this approach has not been shown $\textit{in vivo}$.
  Aim: A computational fundus camera was designed, constructed, and evaluated with the goal of determining the feasibility and performance of phase mask-based computational imaging of the $\textit{in vivo}$ fundus.
  Approach: A holographic diffuser was introduced in a modified commercial fundus camera at a plane conjugate to the ocular pupil, resulting in a linear and shift-invariant point spread function that varies with refractive error. The image could be digitally refocused across a range of $\geq\pm$ 10 diopters of defocus error. The device was tested for ocular safety, and a human imaging pilot study was performed.
  Results: The device captured and digitally refocused color human fundus images. The field of view was $\geq$35 degrees and resolution was 7.7-9.6 line pairs per mm.
  Conclusions: We present the first $\textit{in vivo}$ diffuser-based fundus images, demonstrating the feasibility of computational imaging for ocular diagnostics.</description>

      <title>On the localization of the high-intensity region of simultaneous space-time foci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous space-time focusing (SSTF) is sometimes claimed to reduce the longitudinal extent of the high-intensity region near the focus, in contradiction to the original work on this topic. Here we seek to address this confusion by using numerical and analytical methods to investigate the degree of localization of the spatio-temporal intensity of an SSTF pulse. The analytical method is found to be in excellent agreement with numerical calculations and yields, for bi-Gaussian input pulses, expressions for the three-dimensional spatio-temporal intensity profile of the SSTF pulse, and for the on-axis bandwidth, pulse duration, and pulse-front tilt (PFT) of the SSTF pulse. To provide further insight, we propose a method for determining the transverse input profile of a non-SSTF pulse with equivalent spatial focusing. We find that the longitudinal variations of the peak axial intensities of the SSTF and spatially equivalent (SE) pulses are the same, apart from a constant factor, and hence that SSTF does not constrain the region of high intensity more than a non-SSTF pulse with equivalent focusing. We demonstrate that a simplistic method for calculating the pulse intensity exaggerates the degree of intensity localization, unless the spatio-temporal couplings inherent to SSTF pulses are accounted for.</description>

Abstract: The absorptive chiral metasurface shows evidence of giant nonlinear chiroptical effects, including chiral third harmonic generation, chiral saturated absorption, and chiral reverse saturable absorption. We finally demonstrate proof of concept circular polarized light limiter based on the refractory chiral Mo metasurface and paves the way for nonlinear chiral sensing, nonlinear hot electron generation, and XOR gate of the all-optical full-adder, showcasing the potential of refractory chiral Mo metasurfaces in overcoming the limitations of traditional chiral plasmonic materials.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Non-Gaussian Noise on Auto-correlative Weak-value Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the spectral features of noise and their influence on open quantum systems is fundamental for quantitative understanding and prediction of the dynamics in a realistic environment. For the weak measurements of two-level systems, the weak value obtained from experiments will inevitably be affected by the noise of the environment. Following our earlier work on the technique of the auto-correlative weak-value amplification (AWVA) approach under a Gaussian noise environment, here we study the effect of non-Gaussian noise on the AWVA technique.In particular, two types of noise with a negative-dB signal-to-noise ratio, frequency-stationary noises and frequency-nonstationary noises are studied. The various frequency-stationary noises, including low-frequency (1/f) noises, medium-frequency noises, and high-frequency noises, are generated in Simulink by translating the Gaussian white noise with different band-pass filters. While impulsive noise is studied as an example of frequency-non stationary noises. Our simulated results demonstrate that 1/f noises and impulsive noises have greater disturbance on the AWVA measurements. In addition, adding one kind of frequency-stationary noise, clamping the detected signals, and dominating the measurement range may have the potential to improve the precision of the AWVA technique with both a smaller deviation of the mean value and a smaller error bar in the presence of many hostile non-Gaussian noises.</description>

      <title>Superlens with copper and copper oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the imaging properties of copper-based superlens surrounded by copper oxide (Cu$_2$O). A subwavelength image resolution of the order $\lambda/9$ is demonstrated theoretically and verified in numerical simulations. It is shown that the existence of excitons in Cu$_2$O influence the static and dynamical optical properties of the lens. In particular, an improvement of image quality caused by absorption in the spectral region of excitonic resonances is investigated. The plasmon-exciton interaction in the system may pave the way to a tunable, highly nonlinear superlens designs.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Higher-Order Non-Hermitian Skin and Boundary Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that Amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.</description>

      <title>A Silicon Photonic Neural Network for Chromatic Dispersion Compensation in 20 Gbps PAM4 Signal at 125 km and Its Scalability up to 100 Gbps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A feed-forward photonic neural network (PNN) is tested for chromatic dispersion compensation in Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection optical links. The PNN is based on a sequence of linear and nonlinear transformations. The linear stage is constituted by an 8-tap time-delayed complex perceptron implemented on a Silicon-On-insulator platform and acting as a tunable optical filter. The nonlinear stage is provided by the square modulus of the electrical field applied at the end-of-line photodetector. The training maximizes the separation between the optical levels (i.e. the eye diagram aperture), with consequent reduction of the Bit Error Rate. Effective equalization is experimentally demonstrated for 20 Gbps 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated signal up to 125 km. An evolutionary algorithm and a gradient-based approach are tested for the training and then compared in terms of repeatability and convergence time. The optimal weights resulting from the training are interpreted in light of the theoretical transfer function of the optical fiber. Finally, a simulative study proves the scalability of the layout to larger bandwidths, up to 100 Gbps.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic clustering through interaction-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and opens new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</description>
