      <title>SymTFT Approach for Mixed States with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying phases of mixed states with strong and weak symmetries, including non-invertible or categorical symmetries. The central idea is to consider a purification of the mixed state density matrix, which lives in a doubled Hilbert space. We propose a systematic classification of phases in this doubled Hilbert space, relying crucially on the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach. This framework applies not only to group symmetries but also, importantly, to non-invertible symmetries. We illustrate the approach in 1+1d to classify phases with strong (non-)invertible symmetries, which include strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) phases and mixed strong/weak symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs). We also develop an approach for studying symmetries that involve a combination of strong and weak symmetries. A noteworthy example of this has weak non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry and strong $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The continuum description is complemented by a lattice model analysis informed by the SymTFT framework.</description>

      <title>Looking elsewhere: improving variational Monte Carlo gradients by importance sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Quantum Code Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to modify the stabilizer code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and parity checks. Motivations may include embedding a high-dimensional quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) code into finite-dimensional Euclidean space, or reducing the weights of an arbitrary CSS code. During this embedding, it is essential that the modified CSS code possesses an isomorphic set of logical qubits as the original CSS code. However, despite numerous explicit constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our framework.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Determination of Local Magnetic Fields and Sensor Orientation with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Nanodiamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds have emerged as a promising quantum sensing platform for biomedical imaging applications, yet random orientations of individual particles present significant challenges in large-scale sensor calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to simultaneously determine each particle's crystallographic axes and the surrounding local vector magnetic field. Specifically, a minimum of four distinct bias fields is required to unambiguously extract both the orientation and the local field. We validate our method experimentally using NV centers in two scenarios: (1) in a bulk diamond with known crystal orientation as a proof of concept, and (2) on various single nanodiamonds to mimic real-world applications. Our work represents a crucial step towards unlocking the full potential of nanodiamonds for advanced applications such as in-situ biomedical imaging and nanoscale sensing in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Solving Large-Scale Vehicle Routing Problems with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-level decomposition strategy for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. A Problem-Level Decomposition partitions a 13-node (156-qubit) VRP into smaller Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances. Each TSP is then further cut via Circuit-Level Decomposition, enabling execution on near-term quantum devices. Our approach achieves up to 95\% reductions in the circuit depth, 96\% reduction in the number of qubits and a 99.5\% reduction in the number of 2-qubit gates. We demonstrate this hybrid algorithm on the standard edge encoding of the VRP as well as a novel amplitude encoding. These results demonstrate the feasibility of solving VRPs previously too complex for quantum simulators and provide early evidence of potential quantum utility.</description>

      <title>Engineering giant transmon molecules as mediators of conditional two-photon gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial atoms non-locally coupled to waveguides -- the so-called giant atoms -- offer new opportunities for the control of light and matter. In this work, we show how to use an array of non-locally coupled transmon "molecules" to engineer a passive photonic controlled gate for waveguide photons. In particular, we show that a conditional elastic phase shift between counter-propagating photons arises from the interplay between direction-dependent couplings, engineered through an interplay of non local interactions and molecular binding strength; and the nonlinearity of the transmon array. We analyze the conditions under which a maximal $\pi$-phase shift -- and hence a CZ gate -- is obtained, and characterize the gate fidelity as a function of key experimental parameters, including finite transmon nonlinearities, emitter spectral inhomogeneities, and limited cooperativity. Our work opens the use of giant atoms as key elements of microwave photonic quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Probing Defects with Quantum Simulator Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snapshots, i.e. projective measurements of local degrees of freedom, are the most standard data taken in experiments on quantum simulators. Snapshots are usually used to probe local physics. In this work we propose a simple protocol to experimentally probe physics of defects with these snapshots. Our protocol relies only on snapshots from the bulk system, without introducing the defect explicitly; as such, the physics of different kinds of defects can be probed using the same dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that with snapshots of local spin configurations of, for example, the $1d$ Rydberg atom realization of the quantum Ising criticality, we can (1) extract the ``defect entropy", and (2) access the continuous line of fixed points of effective defect conformal field theory, which was recently discussed in the context of the ``weak-measurement altered criticality".</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Good Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing quantum codes with good parameters and useful transversal gates is a central problem in quantum error correction. In this paper, we continue our work in arXiv:2502.01864 and construct the first family of asymptotically good quantum codes (over qubits) supporting transversally addressable non-Clifford gates. More precisely, given any three logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks, the logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate can be executed on those three logical qubits via a depth-one physical circuit of $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates. This construction is based on the transitive, iso-orthogonal algebraic geometry codes constructed by Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2006). This improves upon our construction from arXiv:2502.01864, which also supports transversally addressable $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates and has inverse-polylogarithmic rate and relative distance.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Induced Nonclassicality in a Generalized Jaynes-Cummings Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of spatial curvature on the Jaynes-Cummings model. We employ an analog model of general relativity, representing the field inside a cavity using oscillators arranged in a circle instead of a straight line, where increasing curvature corresponds to a smaller circle radius. We investigate the nonclassical features of this quantum system arising from the interaction between a two-level atom and a deformed harmonic oscillator on a circle, which serves as curved-space counterpart to the flat oscillator. We analyze the time evolution of atom-field states and, based on this dynamic, examine how spatial curvature influences the Mandel parameter, entropy, and the behavior of the Wigner distribution function. Our results demonstrate that the spatial curvature plays critical roles in controlling these nonclassical properties.</description>

      <title>Accessible Quantum Gates on Classical Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of physical qubits exhibiting strong noise bias, it becomes increasingly relevant to identify which quantum gates can be efficiently implemented on error-correcting codes designed to address a single dominant error type. Here, we consider $[n,k,d]$-classical stabilizer codes addressing bit-flip errors where $n$, $k$ and $d$ are the numbers of physical and logical qubits, and the code distance respectively. We prove that operations essential for achieving a universal logical gate set necessarily require complex unitary circuits to be implemented. Specifically, these implementation circuits either consists of $h$ layers of $r$-transversal operations on $c$ codeblocks such that $c^{h-1}r^h \geq d$ or of $h$ gates, each operating on at most $r$ physical qubits on the same codeblock, such that $hr\geq d$. Similar constraints apply not only to classical codes designed to correct phase-flip errors, but also to quantum stabilizer codes tailored to biased noise. This motivates a closer examination of alternative logical gate constructions using eg.~magic state distillation and cultivation within the framework of biased-noise stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>An order-theoretic circuit syntax and characterisation of the concept lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take an order-theoretic approach to circuit (string diagram) syntax, treating a circuit as a partial order with additional input-output structure. We define morphisms between circuits and prove a factorisation theorem showing that these can, in the finite case, be regarded as formalising a notion of syntactical circuit rewrites, with quotient maps in particular corresponding to gate composition. We then consider the connectivity of a circuit, expressed as a binary relation between its inputs and outputs, and characterise the concept lattice from formal concept analysis as the unique smallest circuit that admits morphisms from all other circuits with the same connectivity. This has significance for quantum causality, particularly to the study of causal decompositions of unitary transformations. We close by constructing the circuit characterised by the dual statement.</description>

      <title>Generated multi-transparency windows, Fano resonances, and slow/fast light in an opto-magnomechanical system through magnon Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a theoretical investigation of magnomechanically induced transparency, Fano resonance, and slow/fast light phenomena within a hybrid optomagnomechanical system. The system consists of a mechanical membrane within a cavity and a ferrimagnetic crystal with a magnon squeezing mode that couples directly to a microwave cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction and indirectly to an optical cavity through the crystal's deformation displacement. The optical cavity is influenced by the mechanical displacement, which is driven by magnetostrictive forces through radiation pressure. The interactions among photon, phonons, magnons, and microwave within the cavity give rise to optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) and magnon-induced transparency (MIT). We analyze how the presence of magnon squeezing modifies the absorption and dispersion properties of the optical spectrum. Additionally, the emergence of Fano resonance via photon-phonon coupling in the presence of the magnon squeezing is examined. By tuning the microwave-magnon interactions and the magnon squeezing parameters, we enhance slow/light effects. Our results aim to contribute to the development of quantum information processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Secure Quantum Relay Networks Using Distributed Entanglement without Classical Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum communication protocols rely heavily on classical authentication for message origin verification, leaving them vulnerable to evolving attacks that exploit classical trust assumptions. In this work, we propose a novel framework for secure quantum relay networks that completely avoids classical authentication. Instead, we leverage pre-distributed entanglement graphs and non-classical correlation-assisted decoding to enable exclusive message retrieval by designated nodes without broadcasting any key or handshake. The system routes messages across multiple relay nodes, yet ensures that no intermediate node can access the message unless it possesses the entangled state partner. We demonstrate that even in multi-path scenarios with asynchronous entanglement distribution, the protocol guarantees quantum-forward secrecy and end-to-end origin integrity without trusted intermediaries. Simulation results confirm both functionality and robustness under entanglement loss and imperfect detection. This architecture paves the way for scalable quantum communication systems where physical quantum states replace classical authentication mechanisms entirely.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Cryptosystems: Integration of Entanglement-Assisted Decryption and Physical Phase Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid cryptographic framework for quantum communication that integrates entanglement-assisted decryption with phase-based physical obfuscation. While conventional quantum protocols often rely on explicit transmission of decryption keys or phase parameters, such models expose critical vulnerabilities to eavesdropping. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage encryption-decryption mechanism. The first stage employs randomized phase modulation protected by active electromagnetic shielding to conceal the quantum signal from unauthorized interception. The second stage enables legitimate receivers to retrieve encrypted phase data using entangled quantum states, eliminating the need for classical key transfer. A formal mathematical framework is developed to describe the two-stage encoding and decryption process, including phase-modulated entangled states and their transformation under nonlocal correlation and adversarial noise. Simulation metrics confirm that the hybrid system preserves quantum coherence with visibility above 94% and entanglement negativity of 0.86, even under dynamic shielding and transmission noise. Simulation results demonstrate that the combined protocol enhances anti-eavesdropping resilience while maintaining quantum coherence. This architecture is suitable for large-scale secure quantum networks, where multi-layered defense strategies are essential against classical and quantum threats.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enhanced Entanglement Detection Under Noisy Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements are inherently noisy, hindering reliable entanglement detection and limiting the scalability of quantum technologies. While error mitigation and correction strategies exist, they often impose prohibitive resource overheads. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to achieve noise-resilient entanglement classification even with imperfect measurements. Using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on features extracted from Pauli measurements, we develop a robust optimal entanglement witness (ROEW) that remains effective under unknown measurement noise. By optimizing SVM parameters against worst-case errors, our protocol significantly outperforms conventional methods in classification accuracy.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that ROEW achieves high-fidelity entanglement detection with minimal measurements, even when measurement errors exceed 10\%. This work bridges machine learning and quantum information science, offering a practical tool for noise-robust quantum characterization and advancing the feasibility of entanglement-based technologies in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Electron-molecule scattering via R-matrix variational algorithms on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron--molecule collisions play a central role in both natural processes and modern technological applications, particularly in plasma processing. Conventional computational strategies such as the R-matrix method have been widely adopted yet encounter significant scaling challenges in treating more complex systems. In this work we present a quantum computational approach that utilises the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and variations thereof to overcome these limitations. We explore a number of methods, including the use of number projection operators and simultaneous optimisation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on a model problem of electron scattering from the hydrogen molecule. We recover the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian within a chosen symmetry sector. Moreover, the optimal circuit parameters directly encode the R-matrix boundary amplitudes needed for subsequent scattering computations.</description>

      <title>Special-Unitary Parameterization for Trainable Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SUN-VQC, a variational-circuit architecture whose elementary layers are single exponentials of a symmetry-restricted Lie subgroup, $\mathrm{SU}(2^{k}) \subset \mathrm{SU}(2^{n})$ with $k \ll n$. Confining the evolution to this compact subspace reduces the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension from $\mathcal{O}(4^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(4^{k})$, ensuring only polynomial suppression of gradient variance and circumventing barren plateaus that plague hardware-efficient ans\"atze. Exact, hardware-compatible gradients are obtained using a generalized parameter-shift rule, avoiding ancillary qubits and finite-difference bias. Numerical experiments on quantum auto-encoding and classification show that SUN-VQCs sustain order-of-magnitude larger gradient signals, converge 2--3$\times$ faster, and reach higher final fidelities than depth-matched Pauli-rotation or hardware-efficient circuits. These results demonstrate that Lie-subalgebra engineering provides a principled, scalable route to barren-plateau-resilient VQAs compatible with near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Theory Framework of Multiplexed Photon-Number-Resolving Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon counting is a fundamental component in quantum optics and quantum information. However, implementing ideal photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors remains experimentally challenging. Multiplexed PNR detection offers a scalable and practical alternative by distributing photons across multiple modes and detecting their presence using simple ON-OFF detectors, thereby enabling approximate photon-number resolution. In this work, we establish a theoretical model for such detectors and prove that the estimation error in terms of photon number moments decreases inverse proportionally to the number of detectors. Thanks to the enhanced PNR capability, multiplexed PNR detector provides an advantage in cat-state breeding protocols. Assuming a two-photon subtraction case, 7dB of squeezing, and an array of 20 detectors of efficiency 95%, our calculation predicts fidelity ~ 0.88 with a success probability ~ 3.8%, representing orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous works. Similar enhancement also extends to cat-state generation with the generalized photon number subtraction. With experimentally feasible parameters, our results suggest that megahertz-rate cat-state generation is achievable using an on-chip array of tens of ON-OFF detectors.</description>

      <title>Universal Long-Time Behavior of the Quantum Fisher Information in Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in quantum systems that possess well-defined classical limits, focusing on the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. We diagnose the DQPTs with the long-time average of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) showing that it abruptly changes at the transition point. Using mean-field and semiclassical approximations, we demonstrate that the long-time average of the QFI reveals universal behavior that persists across different systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor network algorithm to solve polaron impurity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii) measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC. We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future method developments.</description>

      <title>Noise-Canceling Quantum Feedback: non-Hermitian Dynamics with Applications to State Preparation and Magic State Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-continuous quantum measurement allows for the tracking of a quantum system in real time via sequences of short, and individually weak, measurement intervals. Such measurements are necessarily invasive, imparting backaction to the system, and allowing the observer to update their state estimate based on stochastic measurement outcomes. Feedback control then involves real-time interventions by an observer, conditioned on the time-continuous measurement signal that they receive. We here consider diffusive quantum trajectories, and focus on the "noise-canceling" subset of feedback protocols that aim to minimize the degree of stochasticity in the dynamics. We derive such a class of feedback operations, showing that under the idealized assumptions of pure states, unit measurement efficiency, and zero time-delay in implementing feedback operations, perfectly noise-canceling feedback always exists. We consider the resulting noise-canceled dynamics generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian; while non-Hermitian Hamiltonians from continuous monitoring generally describe rare dynamics (accessible by costly post-selection), the use of noise-canceling feedback here leads to non-Hermitian dynamics that occur deterministically. We demonstrate this via examples of entangled state preparation and stabilization. We then illustrate the potential for the application of noise-cancellation to boost success rates in magic state distillation protocols. We show that adding feedback based on noise-cancellation into a time-continuous 5-to-1 distillation protocol leads to higher probabilities of successful distillation across a range of input errors, and extends the threshold on input errors for which the protocol is effective. Our results highlight the efficacy of noise-canceling feedback-aided protocols for quantum state preparation and stabilization tasks.</description>

      <title>Learnable quantum spectral filters for hybrid graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator. Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an $N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when geometric structure plays a significant role.</description>

      <title>Quantum Latin squares with all possible cardinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $n$ (denoted as QLS$(n)$) is an $n\times n$ array whose entries are unit column vectors from the $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_n$, such that each row and column forms an orthonormal basis. Two unit vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_n$ are regarded as identical if there exists a real number $\theta$ such that $|u\rangle=e^{i\theta}|v\rangle$; otherwise, they are considered distinct. The cardinality $c$ of a QLS$(n)$ is the number of distinct vectors in the array. In this paper, we use sub-QLS$(4)$s to prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$ and any integer $c\in [4m,16m^2]\setminus \{4m+1\}$, there is a QLS$(4m)$ with cardinality $c$.</description>

      <title>Superior Frequency Stability and Long-Lived State-Swapping in Cubic-SiC Mechanical Mode Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multimode cavity optomechanical system offers versatile applications including state transduction, coherent interconnection, and many-body simulations. In this study, we developed a cavity electromechanical system that integrates a 3C-SiC membrane and a rectangular superconducting cavity to observe the generation of nearly degenerate pairs of mechanical modes. Subsequently, we derive the expression for intrinsic frequency under nonuniform stress and find that this method supports a remarkably resolution for stress analysis in thin films. Experimentally, we perform collective fitting on the measured set of 57 mechanical modes, revealing deviations in biaxial non-uniform stress on the order of MPa. These degeneracy-broken mechanical modes exhibit exceptional quality factors as high as $10^8$ in a thermal bath of 10 mK. Furthermore, Allan deviation indicates that these modes exhibit extremely stable frequencies compared with different types of optomechanical devices. We then performed state-swapping between near-degenerate mode pairs, demonstrating the transfer efficiency exceeding 78\%, attributed to their exceptionally long lifetimes. This study paves the way for the design of compact quantum phononic devices featuring high-quality-factor mechanical multimode.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Skin-scale-free Localization and Criticality under M\"obius Boundary Conditions in a Non-Hermitian Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems possess exotic localization phenomena beyond their Hermitian counterparts, exhibiting massive accumulation of eigenstates at the system boundaries with different scaling behaviors. In this study, we investigate two weakly coupled non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains under M\"obius boundary conditions (MBCs), and reveal the coexistence of two distinct localization behaviors for eigenstates. Namely, eigenstates exhibit non-Hermitian skin effect in one chain and scale-free localization in the other. Notably, the localization characteristics of eigenstates can exchange between the two chains depending on their eigenenergies. This phenomenon is found to emerge from the critical behaviors induced by the weak interchain coupling, which can even be enhanced by MBCs in comparison \red{to} the system under other boundary conditions. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian localization and criticality, and offer new insights into engineering tunable edge-localized states in synthetic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum relative entropies as a single-copy criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental goal of information theory is to characterize complex operational tasks using efficiently computable information quantities, Shannon's capacity formula being the prime example of this. However, many tasks in quantum information can only be characterized by regularized entropic measures that are often not known to be computable and for which efficient approximations are scarce. It is thus of fundamental importance to understand when regularization is not needed, opening the door to an efficiently computable characterization based on additive quantities. Here, we demonstrate that for a large class of problems, the question of whether regularization is needed or not can be determined at the single-copy level. Specifically, we demonstrate that regularization of the Umegaki relative entropy, along with related quantities such as the Petz and sandwiched relative entropies, is not needed if and only if a single-copy optimizer satisfies a certain property. These problems include hypothesis testing with arbitrarily varying hypotheses as well as quantum resource theories used to derive fundamental bounds for entanglement and magic state distillation. We derive the Stein, Chernoff, and Hoeffding exponents for these problems and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for their additivity, while also presenting partial results for the strong converse exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal engines have been one of the principal topics of thermodynamics ever since its beginning. Today, in the era of the second quantum revolution, although the thermal processes in constant temperatures are relatively well understood in the language of resource theories, a framework to describe thermal engines is still in its infancy. In this work we formalize the resource theory of engines, initially put forward in [Quantum 8, 1222], and define such quantities as engine efficiency. Then, we turn to a detailed study of thermal engines based on free operations arising from the resource theory of athermality under different restrictions: thermal operation, semilocal thermal operations and local thermal operation with classical communication. In order to provide analytic lower bounds for thermal engine operation we construct tree-states -- free states, which can be obtained from Gibbs state in simple protocol consisting solely of two-level operations. Furthermore, we derive a full description of the engine based on semilocal thermal operations describing e.g. free states, faithful monotones and catalytic advantages.</description>

      <title>Observation of hierarchy of Hilbert space ergodicities in the quantum dynamics of a single spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergodicity, the property that all allowed configurations are explored over time, plays a pivotal role in explaining the equilibrium behavior of classical dynamical systems. Yet, such a property is typically precluded in quantum systems owing to the presence of energy eigenstates, which are stationary states in dynamics. However, recent theoretical works have argued that ergodic explorations of the Hilbert space, occurring at varying levels as measured by statistical pseudorandomness of the time-evolved quantum states, may be exhibited for quantum systems driven by Hamiltonians with aperiodic time dependencies, which do not face such obstacles. Here, we experimentally investigate the hierarchy of Hilbert-space ergodicities (HSE) achievable in the dynamics of a single quantum spin realized by a solid-state defect in diamond, upon subjecting it to various time-dependent modulations. Through continuous monitoring of spin trajectories with full state tomography, different degrees of HSE were observed, ranging from no HSE in a time-periodic (Floquet) drive, to partial HSE in a smoothly kicked time-quasiperiodic drive, to complete HSE in a drive composed of a sequence of kicks generated by the Fibonacci word. We formulate a theoretical understanding of the increasing levels of HSE observed by attributing them to increasing levels of complexities associated with the drive sequences, whose notions we elucidate. Our work constitutes the first unambiguous experimental evidence of Hilbert space ergodicity and promotes deeper investigations into the mechanisms and fine-grained levels with which closed quantum systems reach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Reservoir-engineered squeezed lasing through the parametric coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of squeezed lasing in a reservoir-engineered optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO provides a basis of squeezed states and parametric amplification in lasing emission, whose vacuum reservoir is coupled to a squeezed vacuum generated by a second OPO. With a precisely controlled squeezing angle and strong squeezing injection, the parametric interaction in the first OPO is exponentially enhanced. It successfully circumvents the decoherence in the system, and eliminates the undesired noise of spontaneous photon emission in the OPO. As a result, the amplified parametric process simultaneously reserves the coherence and quantum properties in the first OPO, and yields a -6.1 dB squeezed laser in optical domain with a narrow linewidth and high brightness. Our work sheds light on potential applications of squeezed lasing in quantum metrology and quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task: approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown $d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound $\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an average-case distance error. Moreover, our result implies a query lower bound $\Omega(d^2)$ for approximately implementing control-$U$ up to an irrelevant phase, which is also tight with respect to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Mixed states for reference frames transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced laser phase noise filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum noise is the fundamental limit of laser phase noise filter. We cannot realize the effective quantum-enhanced phase noise suppression through simply utilizing amplitude noise suppression scheme. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of a quantum-enhanced laser phase noise filter, achieved by employing a noise ellipse rotation phase noise readout technique combined with an excess amplitude noise suppression scheme. We address the primary limitations in the extracting of laser phase noise, and make the quantum enhancement via squeezed vacuum injection feasible. A maximum of 5 dB quantum-enhanced phase noise suppression is realized across the Fourier frequencies from 5 kHz to 60 kHz. The demonstration unlocks the application of squeezed vacuum state in laser phase noise suppression.</description>

      <title>Structural Perspectives from Quantum States and Measurements in Optimal State Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state discrimination is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory, which refers to a class of techniques to identify a specific quantum state through a positive operator-valued measure. In this work, we investigate how structural information about either the quantum states or the measurement operators can influence our ability to determine or bound the optimal discrimination probability. First, we observe that for single-qubit states, pairwise fidelities are sufficient to completely characterize the optimal discrimination. In contrast, for multi-qubit states, this correspondence breaks down. Motivated by this, we analytically derive the optimal discrimination probability for three equiprobable single-qubit states with equal pairwise fidelities in terms of fidelity. Secondly, we consider partial information about the optimal measurement, specifically the measurement operators that vanish in the optimal solution. We show that such information can be leveraged to tighten existing upper bounds on the optimal discrimination probability. Lastly, we show that in some cases, subsets and supersets of nonvanishing operators can be identified without semidefinite programming.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Noise from Dynamical Mode Decomposition in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise fundamentally limits the performance of quantum systems by degrading coherence and reducing control fidelity. Characterizing this noise is essential for improving measurement accuracy, understanding environmental interactions, and designing effective control strategies. However, extracting its spectral characteristics and associated dephasing times from limited experimental data remains a key challenge.
  Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on Dynamical Mode Decomposition (DMD) to analyze the dynamics of quantum systems under stochastic noise. We reinterpret DMD modes as statistical weights over an ensemble of quantum trajectories and use this mapping to construct a noise power spectral density (PSD) via a nonlinear transformation. This enables identification of dominant frequency contributions in both white and $1/f$ noise environments and directly yields the pure dephasing time $T_2^*$ from DMD eigenvalues. To overcome instability in standard DMD reconstruction, we develop a constrained extrapolation scheme using the extracted $T_2^*$ as a physical bound and the learned PSD as mode weights. We demonstrate our method on simulated Ramsey-type dynamics and validate its ability to recover spectral features and coherence decay. This approach offers a robust, data-driven tool for diagnostic and predictive noise analysis in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We report the cavity quantum electrodynamics conditions using a composite photonic crystal symmetric cavity (CPCSC) on an optical nanocapillary fiber (NCF). The CPCSC is formed by combining the NCF and the symmetric defect mode nano-grating. The maximum channeling efficiency up to 87% is realized by placing the single quantum emitter at the anti-node position of the CPCSC. The current platform paves the way for manipulating single photons with applications in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Wave/particle duality in monitored Jaynes--Cummings resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We operationally uncover aspects of wave/particle duality for the open driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model in its strong-coupling limit. We lay special emphasis on the vacuum Rabi resonance, and determine the corresponding normalized intensity-field correlation function via mapping to ordinary resonance fluorescence. We demonstrate that temporal wave-particle fluctuations of light emanating from an established vacuum Rabi resonance are explicitly non-classical, while the limit of vanishing spontaneous emission restores detailed balance. When photon blockade sets in, individual realizations show a rapidly increasing frequency of fluctuations towards the two-photon resonance, arising as a direct consequence of a resolved JC spectrum. About the two-photon resonance peak, spontaneous emissions are more likely to revive a high-frequency quantum beat in the conditioned electromagnetic field amplitude than photons escaping out of the cavity mode. The beat originates from a coherent superposition of the first excited JC couplet states, and sets the background against which nonclassical phase shifts are observed in the conditioned quadrature amplitudes. We also find that the onset of steady-state bimodality reduces the variation of the normalized intensity-field correlation, at the expense of its temporal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Selective reflection Casimir-Polder spectroscopy in vapor cells: the influence of the thermal velocity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective reflection is a high-resolution spectroscopic method that allows the probing of atomic and molecular gases in the near field of dielectric cell windows. It is a sensitive technique for measuring interactions between excited atoms and surfaces, thus providing a unique tool to probe resonant effects in Casimir-Polder physics. The theoretical modelling of selective reflection spectra has thus far employed the infinite Doppler approximation which assumes that the Doppler shift dominates over the atom-surface interactions as well as the homogeneous transition linewidth. Here we extend the theoretical treatment of selective reflection spectra to include the effects of finite Doppler width. This allows us to analyse the regime of very large Casimir-Polder interactions, relevant for Rydberg atom spectroscopy, and revisit previous analyses of experiments with low-lying excited states. Further, this will aid in determining the signatures of quantum friction in vapor cell spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product entanglement characterizing the optimality of state-preparation quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement offers a powerful framework for understanding the complex collective phenomena in quantum many-body systems that are often beyond the description of conventional bipartite entanglement measures. Here, we propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs with specified virtual bond dimensions $\chi$, and thus are dubbed as $\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\chi$-MPE with respect to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing $\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing $\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\mathcal{H}_{\chi} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{D}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs and $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$ layer circuits. We provide an exact proof that $\mathcal{H}_{\chi=2} \equiv \mathcal{H}_{D=1}$. Our results establish tensor networks as a powerful and general tool for developing parametrized measures of multipartite entanglement. The matrix product form adopted in $\chi$-MPE can be readily extended to other tensor network ans\"atze, whose scaling behaviors are expected to assess the optimality of quantum circuit in preparing the corresponding tensor network states.</description>

      <title>COMS-Integrated Atomic Vapor Cells with Ultra-long Optical Access for Highly Sensitive and Scalable Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most appealing features of chip-scale quantum sensors are their capability to maintain extreme sensitivity while enabling large-scale batch manufacturing. This necessitates high-level integration and wafer-level fabrication of atomic vapor cells. In this paper, we describe a micromachining paradigm for wafer-level atomic vapor cells functionalized by CMOS-compatible non-magnetic heaters and temperature sensors and demonstrate several innovative applications. Leveraging standard micro-nanofabrication technology, the integrated vapor cells achieved an ultra-long optical access of 5 mm, nearly four time that of previously microfabricated vapor cells. The feasibility of the integrated atomic vapor cells fabrication process was verified by a consecutive 30-day aging test in a harsh environment (operating temperature of 473 K and vacuum of approximately 1 Pa). Benefiting from the ultra-long optical path, we observed several typical quantum effects, including the saturation absorption and spin fluctuations, a regime previously inaccessible with conventional micromachined vapor cells. Finally, a zero-field quantum magnetometry with an ultra-high magnetic sensitivity of 12 fT/Hz1/2 was also demonstrated. Our achievements broaden the potential applications of microfabricated atomic vapor cells and pave the way for scalable manufacturing of ultrasensitive, chip-scale quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Instance-Optimal Quantum State Certification with Entangled Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22], they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method, which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15], i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometry can be viewed generally as the measurement of a relative phase between two subsystems. I consider the problem of interfering a quantum resource state with a thermal bath, drawing a precise connection between the athermality of the resource and the resulting phase sensitivity. This is done by finding the fundamental sensing precision limit under the minimal conditions of global unitarity and energy conservation. The results here apply both to general finite-dimensional systems and to linear quantum optics. The same techniques further upper-bound the speed at which a system and bath can jointly evolve under an energy-conserving interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the mathematical model and numerical calculation results for the tunneling of the wave function in a time-periodic double-well potential. The bi-quadratic potential of a double-well form is used. Based on a mathematical model of the time evolution of the wave function, a numerical algorithm has been developed and a program has been created for solving the Schr\"odinger equation, which describes the time evolution of the particle's wave function. As a result of numerical modeling, modulation regimes have been obtained at which tunneling took place. In a stationary double well potential, no tunneling was observed. On the contrary, in the time periodic potential, tunneling was observed, the rate of which depended on the modulation frequency. Adjusting the modulation parameters, it is possible to control the particle wave function tunneling rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06065v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions. Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal correlations are fundamental in quantum physics, yet their computation is often challenging. The regression theorem (or hypothesis) serves as a key tool in this context, offering a seemingly straightforward approach. However, it fails for systems strongly coupled to their surroundings, where memory effects become significant. Here, we extend the analysis of temporal correlations beyond the regression theorem, revealing what can be learned about open quantum systems when this hypothesis fails. We introduce robust, operationally meaningful methods to explore how the breakdown of the regression hypothesis can uncover fundamental quantum features of non-Markovian open systems, including entanglement, coherence, and quantum memory, namely, the fundamental impossibility of simulating memory in non-Markov processes with classical feedback mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate how these quantum features are linked to microscopic properties such as the bath spectral density and heat flow.</description>

      <title>Bounding quantum uncommon information with quantum neural estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Low-depth quantum error correction via three-qubit gates in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires the execution of deep quantum circuits with large numbers of physical qubits to protect information against errors. Designing protocols that can reduce gate and space-time overheads of QEC is therefore crucial to enable more efficient QEC in near-term experiments. Multiqubit gates offer a natural path towards fast and low-depth stabilizer measurement circuits. However, they typically introduce high-weight correlated errors that can degrade the circuit-level distance, leading to slower scalings of the logical error probabilities. In this work, we show how to realize fast and efficient surface code stabilizer readout using only two $CZ_2$ gates -- instead of four $CZ$ -- while preserving fault tolerance, and provide a blueprint for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays. We derive the time-optimal pulses implementing the gates and perform extensive QEC numerical simulations with leakage errors. Compared to the standard protocol using four $CZ$ gates, our scheme is faster, uses fewer gates and crucially maintains fault tolerance with comparable logical error probabilities. Fault-tolerant generalizations of this scheme to other QEC codes, such as quantum Low-Density Parity-Check codes, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometric Invariants of Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a previously unexplored conservation law for the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) expressed as follows; when the QFIM is constructed from a set of observables closed under commutation, i.e., a Lie algebra, the spectrum of the QFIM is invariant under unitary dynamics generated by these same operators. Each Lie algebra therefore endows any quantum state with a fixed "budget" of metrological sensitivity -- an intrinsic resource that we show, like optical squeezing in interferometry, cannot be amplified by symmetry-preserving operations. The Uhlmann curvature tensor (UCT) naturally inherits the same symmetry group, and so quantum incompatibility is similarly fixed. As a result, a metrological analog to Liouville's theorem appears; statistical distances, volumes, and curvatures are invariant under the evolution generated by the Lie algebra. We discuss this as it relates to the quantum analogs of classical optimality criteria. This enables one to efficiently classify useful classes of quantum states at the level of Lie algebras through geometric invariants.</description>

      <title>What's my phase again? Computing the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of quadratic bosonic evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians and their associated unitary transformations form a fundamental class of operations in quantum optics, modeling key processes such as squeezing, displacement, and beam-splitting. Their Heisenberg-picture dynamics simplifies to linear (or possibly affine) transformations on quadrature operators, enabling efficient analysis and decomposition into optical gate sets using matrix operations. However, this formalism discards a phase, which, while often neglected, is essential for a complete unitary characterization. We present efficient methods to recover this phase directly from the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of the unitary, using calculations that scale polynomially with the number of modes and avoid Fock space manipulations. We reduce to integration the general problem, including the case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, and provide analytical results for key cases including when the Hamiltonian is positive definite, passive, active, or single-mode.</description>

      <title>How the Kerr-Cat Qubit Dies-And How to Rescue It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr-cat qubits have been experimentally shown to exhibit a large noise bias, with one decay channel suppressed by several orders of magnitude. In superconducting implementations, increasing the microwave drive on the nonlinear oscillator that hosts the Kerr-cat qubit should, in principle, further enhance this bias. Instead, experiments reveal that above a critical drive amplitude the tunneling time - the less dominant decay channel - ceases to increase and even decreases. Here, we show that this breakdown arises from the multimode nature of the circuit implementation: specifically, the buffer mode used to control the Kerr-cat qubit can induce multiphoton resonances that sharply degrade Kerr-cat coherence if its frequency is not carefully chosen. We uncover this mechanism by retaining the full circuit nonlinearities and treating the strong drive exactly within a Floquet-Markov framework that incorporates quasidegeneracies in the Kerr-cat spectrum. Our results not only provide an explanation for the sudden reduction of the tunneling time but also demonstrate the robustness of the Kerr-cat qubit when its surrounding electromagnetic environment is carefully engineered.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of a noisy classical nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of simulating dynamics of classical nonlinear dissipative systems with $N\gg 1$ degrees of freedom. To make the problem tractable for quantum computers, we add a weak Gaussian noise to the equation of motion and the initial state. Our main result is an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating the noisy dynamics of nonlinear systems satisfying certain sparsity and divergence-free conditions. For any constant nonzero noise rate, the quantum runtime scales polynomially with $\log{(N)}$, evolution time, inverse error tolerance, and the relative strength of nonlinearity and dissipation. Our main technical tool is the Kolmogorov partial differential equation describing time evolution of scalar functions of solutions, averaged over noise. To enable efficient quantum simulation, we project the Kolmogorov equation onto the space of low degree polynomials and derive a rigorous upper bound on the resulting approximation error, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show that the considered simulation problem is BQP-complete, meaning that it is as hard as simulating the universal quantum computer. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm by simulating it numerically for two paradigmatic nonlinear systems: an anharmonic oscillator and the 2D Navier Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Surface-Code Hardware Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable framework for accurately modeling many-body interactions in surface-code quantum processor units (QPUs). Combining a concise diagrammatic formalism with high-precision numerical methods, our approach efficiently evaluates high-order, long-range Pauli string couplings and maps complete chip layouts onto exact effective Hamiltonians. Applying this method to surface-code architectures, such as Google's Sycamore lattice, we identify three distinct operational regimes: computationally stable, error-dominated, and hierarchy-inverted. Our analysis reveals that even modest increases in residual qubit-qubit crosstalk can invert the interaction hierarchy, driving the system from a computationally favorable phase into a topologically ordered regime. This framework thus serves as a powerful guide for optimizing next-generation high-fidelity surface-code hardware and provides a pathway to investigate emergent quantum many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>

      <title>Mapping phase diagrams of quantum spin systems through semidefinite-programming relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of operator monomials for different model parameters, we identify all first- and second-order transitions based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying and understanding quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the heart of both black hole physics and Wigner's friend scenarios lies the question of unitarity. In Wigner's friend setups, sealed-lab measurements are modeled unitarily, probing the measurement problem. In black hole physics, the unitarity problem concerns information preservation in evaporation. We extend a recent analogy between these two puzzles exposed by Hausmann and Renner [arXiv:2504.03835v1] by constructing new paradoxes that merge black hole physics with nonlocal extensions of Wigner's friend scenarios into a unified argument. We briefly discuss possible resolutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Identifying Transient Events in X-ray Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether a novel method of quantum machine learning (QML) can identify anomalous events in X-ray light curves as transient events and apply it to detect such events from the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR14 catalog. The architecture we adopt is a quantum version of the long-short term memory (LSTM) where some fully connected layers are replaced with quantum circuits. The LSTM, making predictions based on preceding data, allows identification of anomalies by comparing predicted and actual time-series data. The necessary training data are generated by simulating active galactic nucleus-like light curves as the species would be a significant population in the XMM-Newton catalog. Additional anomaly data used to assess trained quantum LSTM (QLSTM) models are produced by adding flares like quasi-periodic eruptions to the training data. Comparing various aspects of the performances of the quantum and classical LSTM models, we find that QLSTM models incorporating quantum superposition and entanglement slightly outperform the classical LSTM (CLSTM) model in expressive power, accuracy, and true-positive rate. The highest-performance QLSTM model is then used to identify transient events in 4XMM-DR14. Out of 40154 light curves in the 0.2--12 keV band, we detect 113 light curves with anomalies, or transient event candidates. This number is $\approx$ 1.3 times that of anomalies detectable with the CLSTM model. By utilizing SIMBAD and four wide-field survey catalogs made by ROSAT, SkyMapper, Pan-STARRS, and WISE, no possible counterparts are found for 12 detected anomalies.</description>

      <title>Temporal Incompatibility of Quantum Superposition and Relativistic Causality in Toponium Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-particle duality, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, faces a stringent test in toponium formation. Quantum superposition predicts instantaneous projection into bound states upon top quark pair creation, while relativistic causality requires a finite formation time of $\sim n^3 \times 10^{-25}$ s for the $nS$ states. This temporal conflict challenges the coexistence of wavelike and particlelike behavior at ultrashort timescales. Exploiting the top quark's intrinsic lifetime ($\tau_t \sim 5 \times 10^{-25}$ s) as a quantum chronometer, we simulate the cross-section ratio $R_b = \sigma(e^+e^- \to b\bar{b})/\sum_q \sigma(e^+e^- \to q\bar{q})$ ($q = u,d,s,c,b$) near $\sqrt{s} = 343$ GeV at future lepton colliders (CEPC/FCC-ee). Wavelike and particlelike scenarios yield distinct $R_b$ profiles, enabling $&gt;5\sigma$ discrimination with 1500 fb$^{-1}$ of data. Preliminary LHC data provide independent $2$--$3\sigma$ support. This framework establishes a collider-based probe of quantum state formation with yoctosecond ($10^{-24}$ s) resolution, offering new insight into wavefunction collapse and relativistic quantum information.</description>

Abstract: We investigate bipartite entanglement between a photoelectron and its parent ion when the latter undergoes Rabi oscillations, following the recent experiment of [Nandi et al. Science Advances 10, eado0668 (2024)]. Using numerical simulations on a model atom, we show that this entanglement results from ionization events occurring at different times, with the photoelectron leaving the ion in distinct superpositions of internal states due to the Rabi coupling. Our interpretation brings forward the possibility to access the purity of the photoion state from photoelectron spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate a tomographic reconstruction of the dressed ionic state dynamics from the observable spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a bunching of ~3 photon states, which is a coherent superposition of emitted photons and resonantly scattered laser photons, arising upon excitation by even-$\pi$ pulses of a two-level system represented by a charged quantum dot in a microcavity. This phenomenon emerges because the exciting laser pulse contains several tens of photons whose quantum amplitude distribution creates such a superposition, and the polarization of the scattered photons is changed by the interaction with the charged resonant system. Such a beam is a high-order member of the Fock space, promising for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A simpler probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in closed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local relaxation of closed quantum systems through the relative entropy between the reduced density matrix and its long time limit. We show, using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a significant computational advantage. We go on to relate this to the entanglement asymmetry of the subsystem with respect to time translation invariance. In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states.</description>

      <title>A Hydrodynamic Theory for Non-Equilibrium Full Counting Statistics in One-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of charge fluctuations after homogeneous quantum quenches in one-dimensional systems with ballistic transport. For short but macroscopic times where the non-trivial dynamics is largely dominated by long-range correlations, a simple expression for the associated full counting statistics can be obtained by hydrodynamic arguments. This formula links the non-equilibrium charge fluctuation after the quench to the fluctuations of the associated current after a charge-biased inhomogeneous modification of the original quench which corresponds to the paradigmatic partitioning protocol. Under certain assumptions, the fluctuations in the latter case can be expressed by explicit closed form formulas in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities via the Ballistic Fluctuations Theory. In this work, we identify precise physical conditions for the applicability of a fully hydrodynamic theory, and provide a detailed analysis explicitly demonstrating how such conditions are met and how this leads to such hydrodynamic treatment. We discuss these conditions at length in non-relativistic free fermions, where calculations become feasible and allow for cross-checks against exact results. In physically relevant cases, strong long-range correlations can complicate the hydrodynamic picture, but our formula still correctly reproduces the first cumulants.</description>

Abstract: We present a mathematical formulation of black hole complementarity based on recent rules for including the observer in quantum cosmology. We argue that this provides a self-consistent treatment of the interior of an evaporating black hole throughout its history, as well as the Antonini-Sasieta-Swingle-Rath configuration where a closed universe is entangled with a pair of AdS universes.</description>

      <title>Harmonic emission as a probe to coherent transitions in the topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical behavior of a topological superconducting system, demonstrating that its static configuration undergoes a transition driven by an intrinsic supercurrent. By analyzing the band population, we confirm the quasiparticle nature of the system both in the presence and absence of an external laser field. Under laser driving, we observe an enhancement in static emission forming a plateau-like structure, accompanied by multiple coherent transitions in the population. These transitions exhibit Rabi-like oscillations, attributed to the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS), further reinforcing the quasiparticle character of the model. Our results highlight the efficacy of laser driving as a probe of the system's topological and dynamical stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) framework to open quantum systems. Using canonical purification, we embed mixed states into a doubled (2+1)-dimensional topological order and employ the slab construction to study (1+1)-dimensional mixed-state phases through condensable algebras in the doubled SymTFT. Hermiticity and positivity of the density matrix impose additional constraints on allowable anyon condensations, enabling a systematic classification of mixed-state phases - including strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases. We present examples of mixed-state phase transitions involving SWSSB and show how gauging within the open SymTFT framework reveals connections among different mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds of quantum speed limit for noisy dynamics via maximum rotation angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:1601.00150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laws of quantum physics place a limit on the speed of computation. In particular, the evolution time of a system from an initial state to a final state cannot be arbitrarily short. Bounds on the speed of evolution for unitary dynamics have long been studied. A few bounds on the speed of evolution for noisy dynamics have also been obtained recently, which are, however, not tight. In this paper, we present a new framework for quantum speed limit concerning noisy dynamics. Within this framework, we obtain the exact maximum rotation angle that noisy dynamics can achieve at any given time, which gives rise to a tight bound on the evolution time for noisy dynamics. The bound obtained through semi-definite programming highlights the fundamental differences between noisy dynamics and unitary dynamics. Furthermore, we show that the \textit{orthogonalization} time, defined as the minimum time required to evolve any initial state to a state with zero fidelity with respect to the initial state, is generally not applicable to noisy dynamics.</description>

      <title>Undecidability in resource theory: can you tell theories apart?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.09341v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central question in resource theory is whether one can construct a set of monotones that completely characterise the allowed transitions dictated by a set of free operations. A similar question is whether two distinct sets of free operations generate the same class of transitions. These questions are part of the more general problem of whether it is possible to pass from one characterisation of a resource theory to another. In the present letter we prove that in the context of quantum resource theories this class of problems is undecidable in general. This is done by proving the undecidability of the membership problem for CPTP maps, which subsumes all the other results.</description>

Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a collection of observables that can characterize separable states and, experimentally, estimating EWs can verify entangled states. In this work, we show that a fixed measurement setting on a multipartite entangled state, which we introduce as a network state for the purpose, can estimate EWs. Namely, entangled states can be fully verified in a measurement-based manner, in which experimenters do not necessarily change measurement settings. We present a fixed measurement setting and network states for estimating decomposable EWs, equivalent to the partial transpose criteria. We also consider non-decomposable EWs that detect bound entangled states beyond the partial transpose criteria. The results can be extended to multipartite states such as graph states, a resource for measurement-based quantum computing, and readily applied to distributed settings such as quantum metrology or sensor networks where multipartite entangled states are resourceful.</description>

      <title>Estimating Eigenenergies from Quantum Dynamics: A Unified Noise-Resilient Measurement-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground state energy estimation in physical, chemical, and materials sciences is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid approach that finds the eigenenergies by collecting real-time measurements and post-processing them using the machinery of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). From the perspective of quantum dynamics, we establish that our approach can be formally understood as a stable variational method on the function space of observables available from a quantum many-body system. We also provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that our method converges rapidly even in the presence of a large degree of perturbative noise, and show that the method bears an isomorphism to robust matrix factorization methods developed independently across various scientific communities. Our numerical benchmarks on spin and molecular systems demonstrate an accelerated convergence and a favorable resource reduction over state-of-the-art algorithms. The DMD-centric strategy can systematically mitigate noise and stands out as a leading hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Quantum States which are Zero on the Symmetric Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system of n qudits and the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the associated Hilbert space. In this decomposition, one of the subspaces is the so-called symmetric subspace or symmetric sector, that is, the subspace of all states that are invariant under the action of the symmetric group. We prove that any separable state must have a nonzero component on the symmetric sector, or, equivalently, any state which has zero component on the symmetric sector must be entangled. For the cases of n=2,3 particles, and in arbitrary dimension d, this result can be refined by providing sharp lower bounds on the size of the component of separable states on the symmetric sector. This leads us to identify a class of entanglement witnesses for these systems. We provide an example showing that in the multipartite case, this class of witnesses detects PPT entangled states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of quantum acoustics has enabled the cooling of mechanical objects to their quantum ground state, generation of mechanical Fock-states, and Schrodinger cat states. Such demonstrations have made mechanical resonators attractive candidates for quantum information processing, metrology, and macroscopic tests of quantum mechanics. However, generating large-amplitude phonon states in quantum acoustic systems has been elusive. In this work, a single superconducting qubit coupled to a high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator is used to generate a large phonon population in an acoustic mode of a high-overtone resonator. We observe extended ringdowns of the qubit, confirming the generation of a large amplitude phonon state, and also observe an upper threshold behavior, a consequence of phonon quenching predicted by our model. This work provides a key tool for generating arbitrary phonon states in circuit quantum acoustodynamics, which is important for fundamental and quantum information applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random and uncontrollable noises from the environment during the design and measurement of superconducting qubits lead to limitations in qubit coherence time and gate fidelity, which is a major challenge in the current state of the art for superconducting quantum computing. To advance superconducting qubits technologies it is essential to understand and mitigate environmentally induced errors. This requires modeling superconducting qubits as open quantum systems coupled to their surroundings. The present study aims to provide useful open quantum system approaches to analyze and quantify the interaction between the superconducting qubits and their environment. We provide an accessible introduction to open quantum systems for newcomers to the field. For experts we discuss recently developed methods for analyzing qubit dynamics under realistic noises. We outline how these techniques provide quantitative insights into the decoherence mechanism and how they can guide design improvements to enhance qubits' coherence time. This self-contained review of open quantum system approaches can be used to model, understand, and improve superconducting qubit performance in the presence of unavoidable environmental noises.</description>

      <title>Quantum PCPs: on Adaptivity, Multiple Provers and Reductions to Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a general formulation of quantum PCPs, which captures adaptivity and multiple unentangled provers, and give a detailed construction of the quantum reduction to a local Hamiltonian with a constant promise gap. The reduction turns out to be a versatile subroutine to prove properties of quantum PCPs, allowing us to show: (i) Non-adaptive quantum PCPs can simulate adaptive quantum PCPs when the number of proof queries is constant. In fact, this can even be shown to hold when the non-adaptive quantum PCP picks the proof indices simply uniformly at random from a subset of all possible index combinations, answering an open question by Aharonov, Arad, Landau and Vazirani (STOC '09). (ii) If the $q$-local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap can be solved in $\mathsf{QCMA}$, then $\mathsf{QPCP}[q] \subseteq \mathsf{QCMA}$ for any $q \in O(1)$. (iii) If $\mathsf{QMA}(k)$ has a quantum PCP for any $k \leq \text{poly}(n)$, then $\mathsf{QMA}(2) = \mathsf{QMA}$, connecting two of the longest-standing open problems in quantum complexity theory. Moreover, we also show that there exist (quantum) oracles relative to which certain quantum PCP statements are false. Hence, any attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture requires, just as was the case for the classical PCP theorem, (quantumly) non-relativizing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic codes encode quantum information into a single infinite-dimensional physical system endowed with error correction capabilities. This reduces the need for complex management of many physical constituents compared with standard approaches employing multiple physical qubits. Recent discussions of bosonic codes centre around correcting only boson-loss errors, with phase errors either actively suppressed or deferred to subsequent layers of encoding with standard qubit codes. Rotationally symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, which include the well-known cat and binomial codes, are capable of simultaneous correction of loss and phase errors, offering an alternate route that deals with arbitrary errors already at the base layer. Here, we investigate the robustness of such codes, moving away from the more idealistic past studies towards a circuit-level noise analysis closer to the practical situation where every physical component in the device is potentially faulty. We extend the concept of fault tolerance to the case of RSB codes, and then examine the performance of two known error correction circuits under circuit-level noise. Our analysis reveals a significantly more stringent noise threshold for fault-tolerant operation than found in past works; nevertheless, we show how, through waiting-time optimization and the use of squeezing, we can restore the noise requirements to a regime achievable with near-term quantum hardware. While our focus here is on cat codes for concreteness, a similar analysis applies for general RSB codes.</description>

      <title>On the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational quantum learning models</title>

Abstract: The quest for successful variational quantum machine learning (QML) relies on the design of suitable parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), as analogues to neural networks in classical machine learning. Successful QML models must fulfill the properties of trainability and non-dequantization, among others. Recent works have highlighted an intricate interplay between trainability and dequantization of such models, which is still unresolved. In this work we contribute to this debate from the perspective of machine learning, proving a number of results identifying, among others when trainability and non-dequantization are not mutually exclusive. We begin by providing a number of new somewhat broader definitions of the relevant concepts, compared to what is found in other literature, which are operationally motivated, and consistent with prior art. With these precise definitions given and motivated, we then study the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational QML. Next, we also discuss the degrees of "variationalness" of QML models, where we distinguish between models like the hardware efficient ansatz and quantum kernel methods. Finally, we introduce recipes for building PQC-based QML models which are both trainable and nondequantizable, and corresponding to different degrees of variationalness. We do not address the practical utility for such models. Our work however does point toward a way forward for finding more general constructions, for which finding applications may become feasible.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</description>

      <title>Efficient tensor network simulation of multi-emitter non-Markovian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical method to simulate a system of multiple emitters coupled to a non-interacting bath, in any parameter regime. Our method relies on a Block Lanczos transformation that maps the whole system onto a strip geometry, whose width is given by the number of emitters. Utilizing the spatial symmetries of the problem and identifying the relevant range of energies of the bath we achieve a more efficient simulation, which we perform using tensor network techniques. As a demonstration, we study the collective emission from multiple emitters coupled to a square lattice of bosons and observe how the departure from Markovianity as coupling strength and emitter number is increased prevents collective radiation. We also simulate the dynamic preparation of an excitation in a bound state from a multi-excitation initial state. Our work opens new possibilities for the systematic exploration of non-Markovian effects in the dynamics and equilibrium properties of multi-emitter systems. Furthermore, it can easily be extended to other setups, including finite bath temperature or impurities coupled to fermionic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study their analogues for systems composed of Majorana fermions. In this case, a crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system with fundamentally fermionic degrees of freedom. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving Majorana Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\F$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group when acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on the same sector.</description>

      <title>Experimental Quantum State Certification by Actively Sampling Photonic Entangled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled quantum states are essential ingredients for many quantum technologies, but they must be validated before they are used. As a full characterization is prohibitively resource-intensive, recent work has focused on developing methods to efficiently extract a few parameters of interest, in a so-called verification framework. Most existing approaches are based on preparing an ensemble of nominally identical and independent (IID) quantum states, and then measuring each copy of the ensemble. However, this leaves no states left for the intended quantum tasks and the IID assumptions do not always hold experimentally. To overcome these challenges, we experimentally implement quantum state certification (QSC) proposed by Gocanin \textit{et al.}, which measures only a subset of the ensemble, certifying the fidelity of multiple copies of the remaining states. We use active optical switches to randomly sample from sources of two-photon Bell states and three-photon GHZ states, reporting statistically-sound fidelities in real time without destroying the entire ensemble. Additionally, our QSC protocol removes the assumption that the states are identically distributed (but still assumes independent copies), can achieve close $N^{-1}$ scaling, in the number of states measured $N$, and can be implemented in a device-independent manner. Altogether, these benefits make our QSC protocol suitable for benchmarking large-scale quantum computing devices and deployed quantum communication setups relying on entanglement in both standard and adversarial situations.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <title>Quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs, and more particularly in the unidirectional model, where the algorithm is allowed to query only the outgoing edges of a vertex. In the classical unidirectional model, the problem of testing $k$-star-freeness, and more generally $k$-source-subgraph-freeness, is almost maximally hard for large $k$. We prove that this problem has almost quadratic advantage in the quantum setting. Moreover, we show that this advantage is nearly tight, by showing a quantum lower bound using the method of dual polynomials on an intermediate problem for a new, property testing version of the $k$-collision problem that was not studied before.
  To illustrate that not all problems in graph property testing admit such a quantum speedup, we consider the problem of $3$-colorability in the related undirected bounded-degree model, when graphs are now undirected. This problem is maximally hard to test classically, and we show that also quantumly it requires a linear number of queries.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics I: phenomenology of quantum observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.</description>

      <title>When Quantum and Classical Models Disagree: Learning Beyond Minimum Norm Least Square</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning algorithms based on Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) are important candidates for useful application of quantum computing. It is known that a VQC is a linear model in a feature space determined by its architecture. Such models can be compared to classical ones using various sets of tools, and surrogate models designed to classically approximate their results were proposed. At the same time, quantum advantages for learning tasks have been proven in the case of discrete data distributions and cryptography primitives. In this work, we propose a general theory of quantum advantages for regression problems. Using previous results, we establish conditions on the weight vectors of the quantum models that are necessary to avoid dequantization. We show that this theory is compatible with previously proven quantum advantages on discrete inputs, and provides examples of advantages for continuous inputs. This separation is connected to large weight vector norm, and we suggest that this can only happen with a high dimensional feature map. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to design quantum models that cannot be classically approximated with good generalization. Finally, we discuss how concentration issues must be considered to design such instances. We expect that our work will be a starting point to design near-term quantum models that avoid dequantization methods by ensuring non-classical convergence properties, and to identify existing quantum models that can be classically approximated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing robust quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors operating at molecular scales. However, current noise spectroscopies rely on severe approximations that sacrifice accuracy and precision. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. It self-consistently extracts noise spectra that characterize the interactions between a quantum sensor and its environment from commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is resilient to measurement errors. We quantify confidence intervals and sensitivity measures to identify experiments that improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that previous measurements had overestimated the strength of low-frequency noise by an order of magnitude. Our method uncovers previously hidden structure with unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</description>

Abstract: The spectral structure of a photonic reservoir shapes radiation phenomena for embedded quantum emitters. We implement an all-optical analog to study such an effect, particularly to observe the non- Markovian radiation dynamics of an emitter coupled to two-dimensional structured reservoirs. Its dynamics is simulated by light propagating through a photonic lattice, acting as a reservoir for an adjacent waveguide that mimics a coupled quantum emitter. We study radiation dynamics in square and Lieb lattices under different coupling regimes and observe how the flat band properties of the Lieb lattice significantly enhances light-matter coupling and non-Markovianity. Our platform opens a path for the experimental exploration of single-photon quantum optical phenomena in structured reservoirs to enhance light-matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson sampling stands out as a promising approach toward experimental demonstration of quantum computational advantage. However, the presence of physical noise in near-term experiments hinders the realization of the quantum computational advantage with boson sampling. Since physical noise in near-term boson sampling devices is inevitable, precise characterization of the boundary of noise rates where the classical intractability of boson sampling is maintained is crucial for quantum computational advantage using near-term devices. In this work, we identify the level of partial distinguishability noise that upholds the classical intractability of boson sampling. We find that boson sampling with on average $O(\log N)$ number of distinguishable photons out of $N$ input photons maintains the equivalent complexity to the ideal boson sampling case. By providing strong complexity theoretical evidence for the classical intractability of noisy boson sampling, we expect that our findings will ultimately facilitate the demonstration of quantum computational advantage with noisy boson sampling experiments in the near future.</description>

      <title>Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of quantum codes with good error correction parameters and useful sets of transversal gates is a problem of major interest in quantum error-correction. Abundant prior works have studied transversal gates which are restricted to acting on all logical qubits simultaneously. In this work, we study codes that support transversal gates which induce $\textit{addressable}$ logical gates, i.e., the logical gates act on logical qubits of our choice. As we consider scaling to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead, addressable logical operations presents an important problem for both theoretical and practical purposes.
  Our primary result is the construction of an explicit qubit code for which $\textit{any}$ triple of logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks can be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a depth-one circuit of physical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, and whose parameters are asymptotically good, up to polylogarithmic factors. The result naturally generalizes to other gates including the $\mathsf{C}^{\ell} Z$ gates for $\ell \neq 2$.
  Going beyond this, we develop a formalism for constructing quantum codes with $\textit{addressable and transversal}$ gates. Our framework, called $\textit{addressable orthogonality}$, encompasses the original triorthogonality framework of Bravyi and Haah (Phys. Rev. A 2012), and extends this and other frameworks to study addressable gates. We demonstrate the power of this framework with the construction of an asymptotically good qubit code for which $\textit{pre-designed}$, pairwise disjoint triples of logical qubits within a single codeblock may be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a physical depth-one circuit of $\mathsf{Z}$, $\mathsf{CZ}$ and $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates. In an appendix, we show that our framework extends to addressable and transversal $T$ gates, up to Clifford corrections.</description>

      <title>Study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective</title>

Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>

      <title>Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline states in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering processes involve iterative design evaluations requiring numerous computationally intensive numerical simulations. Quantum algorithms promise up to exponential speedups for specific tasks relevant to numerical simulations. However, these advantages quickly vanish when considering data input and output on quantum computers. The recently introduced Quantum Simulation-Based Optimization (QuSO) algorithm circumvents this fundamental impediment by treating simulations as subproblems within a larger optimization problem. In this paper, we adapt and implement QuSO for a cooling system design problem. We validate the algorithm through statevector simulations and provide a detailed algorithmic complexity analysis indicating that the achievable speedup for this particular example is at most polynomial. Notably, we also specify the conditions under which QuSO could deliver exponential advantages. By providing this comprehensive demonstration, we highlight both the promise and practical constraints of QuSO in an engineering context, motivating further research into quantum algorithms for classical simulations and the search for suitable applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is key in drug discovery, but classical methods face limitations when handling high-dimensional data and capturing complex molecular interactions. This research proposes enhancing QSAR techniques through Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), which leverage quantum computing principles to process information Hilbert spaces. By using quantum data encoding and quantum kernel functions, we aim to develop more accurate and efficient predictive models.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality ellipse and application in quantum imaging with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to quantify the interplay between coherence and wave-particle duality in generic two-path interference systems. Our analysis reveals a closed-form duality ellipse (DE) equality, that rigorously unifies visibility (a traditional waveness measure) and predictability (a particleness measure) with degree of coherence, providing a complete mathematical embodiment of Bohr's complementarity principle. Extending this framework to quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP), where both path information and photon interference are inherently linked to spatial object reconstruction, we establish an imaging duality ellipse (IDE) that directly connects wave-particle duality to the object's transmittance profile. This relation enables object characterization through duality measurements alone and remains robust against experimental imperfections such as decoherence and misalignment. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of quantum duality while offering a practical toolkit for optimizing coherence-driven quantum technologies, from imaging to sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum state of ultracold atoms is often determined through measurement of the spatial distribution of the atom cloud. Absorption imaging of the cloud is regularly used to extract this spatial information. Accurate determination of the parameters which describe the spatial distribution of the cloud is crucial to the success of many ultracold atom applications. In this work, we present modified deep learning image classification models for image regression. To overcome challenges in data collection, we train the model on simulated absorption images. We compare the performance of the deep learning models to least-squares techniques and show that the deep learning models achieve accuracy similar to least-squares, while consuming significantly less computation time. We compare the performance of models which take a single atom image against models which use an atom image plus other images that contain background information, and find that both models achieved similar accuracy. The use of single image models will enable single-exposure absorption imaging, which simplifies experiment design and eases imaging hardware requirements.</description>

      <title>Scalable Simulation of Fermionic Encoding Performance on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compelling application of quantum computers with thousands of qubits is quantum simulation. Simulating fermionic systems is both a problem with clear real-world applications and a computationally challenging task. In order to simulate a system of fermions on a quantum computer, one has to first map the fermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian. The most popular such mapping is the Jordan-Wigner encoding, which suffers from inefficiencies caused by the high weight of some encoded operators. As a result, alternative local encodings have been proposed that solve this problem at the expense of a constant factor increase in the number of qubits required. Some such encodings possess local stabilizers, i.e., Pauli operators that act as the logical identity on the encoded fermionic modes. A natural error mitigation approach in these cases is to measure the stabilizers and discard any run where a measurement returns a -1 outcome. Using a high-performance stabilizer simulator, we classically simulate the performance of a local encoding known as the Derby-Klassen encoding and compare its performance with the Jordan-Wigner encoding and the ternary tree encoding. Our simulations use more complex error models and significantly larger system sizes (up to $18\times18$) than in previous work. We find that the high sampling requirements of postselection methods with the Derby-Klassen encoding pose a limitation to its applicability in near-term devices and call for more encoding-specific circuit optimizations.</description>

      <title>Entropic Dynamics approach to Relational Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general framework of Entropic Dynamics (ED) is used to construct non-relativistic models of relational quantum mechanics from well known inference principles - probability, entropy and information geometry. Although only partially relational - the absolute structures of simultaneity and Euclidean geometry are still retained - these models provide a useful testing ground for ideas that will prove useful in the context of more realistic relativistic theories. The fact that in ED the positions of particles have definite values, just as in classical mechanics, has allowed us to adapt to the quantum case some intuitions from Barbour and Bertotti's classical framework. Here, however, we propose a new measure of the mismatch between successive states that is adapted to the information metric and the symplectic structures of the quantum phase space. We make explicit that ED is temporally relational and we construct non-relativistic quantum models that are spatially relational with respect to rigid translations and rotations. The ED approach settles the longstanding question of what form should the constraints of a classical theory take after quantization: the quantum constraints that express relationality are to be imposed on expectation values. To highlight the potential impact of these developments, the non-relativistic quantum model is parametrized into a generally covariant form and we show that the ED approach evades the analogue of what in quantum gravity has been called the problem of time.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Theorems for the Equivalence of Parameterized Quantum Circuits (Extended)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many promising quantum algorithms in economics, medical science, and material science rely on circuits that are parameterized by a large number of angles. To ensure that these algorithms are efficient, these parameterized circuits must be heavily optimized. However, most quantum circuit optimizers are not verified, so this procedure is known to be error-prone. For this reason, there is growing interest in the design of equivalence checking algorithms for parameterized quantum circuits. In this paper, we define a generalized class of parameterized circuits with arbitrary rotations and show that this problem is decidable for cyclotomic gate sets. We propose a cutoff-based procedure which reduces the problem of verifying the equivalence of parameterized quantum circuits to the problem of verifying the equivalence of finitely many parameter-free quantum circuits. Because the number of parameter-free circuits grows exponentially with the number of parameters, we also propose a probabilistic variant of the algorithm for cases when the number of parameters is intractably large. We show that our techniques extend to equivalence modulo global phase, and describe an efficient angle sampling procedure for cyclotomic gate sets.</description>

      <title>Entropic characterization of Tunneling and State Pairing in a Quasi-Exactly Solvable Sextic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the (de)localization properties of a quasi-exactly solvable (QES) sextic potential $V_{\text{QES}}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x^6 + 2x^4 - 2(2\lambda + 1)x^2)$ as a function of the tunable parameter $\lambda \in [-\frac{3}{4}, 6]$. For $\lambda &gt; -\frac{1}{2}$, the potential exhibits a symmetric double-well structure, with tunneling emerging for the ground state level at $\lambda \approx 0.732953$. {For the lowest energy states \( n = 0,1,2,3 \), we construct physically meaningful variational wavefunctions that $i)$ respect parity symmetry under the transformation $x \rightarrow -x$, $ii)$ exhibit the correct asymptotic behavior at large distances, and $iii)$ allow for exact analytical Fourier transforms. Variational energies match Lagrange Mesh and available exact analytical QES results with relative errors $\simeq 10^{-8}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2$ and $\simeq 10^{-6}$ for the third excited state $n=3$. We demonstrate that entropic measures (Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler, and Cumulative Residual Jeffreys divergences) surpass conventional variance-based methods in revealing tunneling transitions, wavefunction symmetry breaking, and quantum state pairing. Our results confirm that the Beckner-Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski entropic uncertainty relation holds across all examined values of $n$ and $\lambda$. The quality of the trial function is also validated by the small $\sim10^{-10}$ Cumulative Residual Jeffreys divergences from the exact QES solutions.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics II: deducing the formalism from experimental observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel, non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the established theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Emergent criticality in a constrained boson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12107v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify. This emergence leads to a critical theory which seems to be different from those in the Ising universality class. Instead, within the data obtained from finite-size scaling analysis, we find the critical theory to be not inconsistent with Ashkin-Teller universality in the sense that the transitions of the model reproduces a critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$ close to unity. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Variational Monte Carlo method has recently seen important advances through the use of neural network quantum states. While more and more sophisticated ans\"atze have been designed to tackle a wide variety of quantum many-body problems, modest progress has been made on the associated optimisation algorithms. In this work, we revisit the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature, an optimiser that has been used extensively in a variety of simulations. We suggest improvements on the scaling and the direction of this optimiser, and find that they substantially increase its performance at a negligible additional cost. We also reformulate the Variational Monte Carlo approach in a game theory framework, to propose a novel optimiser based on decision geometry. We find that, on a practical test case for continuous systems, this new optimiser consistently outperforms any of the KFAC improvements in terms of stability, accuracy and speed of convergence. Beyond Variational Monte Carlo, the versatility of this approach suggests that decision geometry could provide a solid foundation for accelerating a broad class of machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer State Representation and Pairing in the Fermionic Tonks-Girardeau Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative expression for the ground state wave function of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. Our wave function is constructed based on the occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the one-body density matrix. We demonstrate that the newly found wave function describes the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas under any external potential. By expressing the proposed wave function in the framework of second quantization, we show that the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a number-conserving Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. We provide explicit expressions for the corresponding coefficients that describe the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Additionally, the suitable form of the proposed wave function in second quantization allows us to derive the necessary expectation values to experimentally detect pairing in the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. With this, we prove and show how to detect that the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas not only exhibits non-trivial quantum correlations but is also a paired state.</description>

Abstract: An ensemble of electrons trapped above superfluid helium offers a paradigm system for investigating and controlling collective charge dynamics in low-dimensional electronic matter. Of particular interest is the ability to spatially control and engineer surface plasmons for integration with hybrid quantum systems and circuit quantum electrodynamic device architectures. Here we present experiments using an electron-on-helium microchannel device that hosts microwave-frequency plasmons, generated via local microwave excitation in an electrostatically defined central channel. By precisely varying the electron density, we demonstrate tunability of plasmon mode frequencies over several GHz. Additionally, we find that the power dependence of these modes can be used to investigate both homogeneous and inhomogeneous sources of spectral broadening. These results demonstrate the versatility of electrons on helium for probing collective excitations in low-dimensional Coulomb liquids and solids, and demonstrate a path for integrating engineered plasmons in electrons on helium with hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) that interchanges fermions and bosons is of great theoretical importance but has not yet been revealed experimentally in particle physics. It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models. Inspired by the recent experiments of Floquet engineering of Rydberg atom arrays, we propose to simulate quantum mechanical supersymmetric model and realize quantum mechanical SUSY in Floquet Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments. This work sheds light on the future experimental exploration of SUSY with the help of Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Engineering of self-bending surface plasmon polaritons through Hermite-Gaussian mode expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons have received much attention over the last decades in photonics or nanotechnology due to their inherent high sensitivity to metal surface variations (e.g., presence of adsorbates or changes in the roughness). It is thus expected that they will find promising major applications in widely cross-disciplinary areas, from material science to medicine. Here we introduce a novel theoretical framework suitable for designing new types of structured paraxial surface plasmon beams and controlling their propagation. More specifically, this method relies on a convenient Hermite--Gaussian mode expansion, which constitutes a complete basis set upon which new types of structured paraxial plasmon beams can be generated. The family of beams generated in this way presents a rather peculiar feature: they exhibit local intensity maxima at different propagation distances, which enables the control over where to place the beam energy. This, thus, opens up worthwhile pathways to manipulate light propagation along metal surfaces at the nanoscale. As a proof-of-concept, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of the method by analyzing the propagation of Airy-based surface plasmon polaritons along an air--silver interface.</description>

      <title>A high optical access cryogenic system for Rydberg atom arrays with a 3000-second trap lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optical tweezer array of $^{87}$Rb atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4 K cryopumping surface, a &lt;50 K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model for broad range of strongly correlated phases, particularly the high-Tc superconductor. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</description>

      <title>The trace distance between density matrices, a nifty tool in new-physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information methods have been brought to bear on high-energy physics, including the study of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in collider experiments. Quantum information observables have also been employed to constrain possible new physics effects. We improve on this point by introducing quantum information tools routinely used to compare quantum states: the trace distance and the fidelity. We find that the former outperforms other quantum information observables considered in the literature and, together with the cross section, yields the strongest bounds on possible departures from the Standard Model. The power of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with three examples of new physics searches. The first concerns the chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark and yields the first bound computed by means of quantum tomography and actual experimental data. The other two examples use Monte Carlo simulations and set the projected limits on the anomalous couplings of the $\tau$ leptons at Belle and at a future collider, which is taken to be LEP3. For these new physics searches we also compare the sensitivity of the trace distance to those of other quantum information quantities like concurrence, magic, and the fidelity distance. In passing, we provide the first determinations of magic in colliders data by analyzing the top-quark pair production at the LHC and the charmonium decays. The significance is well above the $5\sigma$ level in both the cases.</description>

      <title>Classical representation of the dynamics of quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of quantum mechanics, classical probability interpretations have faced significant challenges. A notable issue arises with the emergence of negative probabilities when attempting to define the joint probability of non-commutative observables. In this work, we propose a resolution to this dilemma for quantum spin chains, by introducing an exact representation of their dynamics in terms of classical continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). These CTMCs effectively model the creation, annihilation, and propagation of pairs of classical particles and antiparticles. The quantum dynamics then emerges by averaging over various realizations of this classical process.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact simple gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on ``link complements'', i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger state (GHZ)-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three dimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic modulation of the stronger intra-cell couplings in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <title>Dissipation engineering of fermionic long-range order beyond Lindblad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. Phys.Rev.Lett. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator systems of matrices can be viewed as quantum analogues of finite graphs. This analogy suggests many natural combinatorial questions in linear algebra. We determine the quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$ and the lower quantum Tur\'an numbers $T^\downarrow(n, m)$ with $m \geq n/4$. In particular, we conclude that $QR(2,2) = 4$ and confirm Weaver's conjecture that $T^\downarrow(4, 1) = 4$. We also obtain a new result for the existence of anticliques in quantum graphs of low dimension.</description>

      <title>Linking diffusive fields to virtual waves as their propagative duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In non-destructive and biomedical imaging, spatial patterns inside a sample are imaged without destroying it. Therefore, propagating waves, including electromagnetic or ultrasonic signals, or even diffuse heat are generated or modified by these internal patterns and transmit this structural information to the sample surface. There, the signals can be detected, and an image of the internal structure can be reconstructed from the measured signals. The amount of information about the interior of the sample that can be obtained from the detected signals at the sample surface is significantly influenced by the propagation from the internal structure to the surface. In the real world, all signal propagation is more or less irreversible. The entropy generated during propagation corresponds to the loss of information.
  In an idealized model, such propagating waves, called virtual waves, are described by the wave equation. They remain valid solutions of this equation when the direction of time is reversed, thus exhibiting reversibility and showing no entropy production and therefore no loss of information during propagation.
  We have used the locally computed virtual waves from the measured diffusive surface signals for image reconstruction using established time-of-flight methods from ultrasound or RADAR imaging. This improves the spatial resolution in thermography and compensates for the dispersion of quantum wave packets in atom probe tomography.</description>
