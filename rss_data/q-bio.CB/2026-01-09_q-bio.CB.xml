      <title>Thermodynamic Constraints Drive Hierarchical Preemption in Cellular Decision-Making: A Hybrid Petri Net Framework with Application to Bacillus subtilis Sporulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular decision-making under stress involves rapid pathway selection despite energy scarcity. Here we demonstrate that thermodynamic constraints actively drive energy-efficient sporulation, where continuous metabolic sources enable system robustness through dynamic energy management. Using hybrid Petri nets (stochastic transitions with continuous sources) to model Bacillus subtilis sporulation, we show that stress conditions (ATP = 300 mM, 94% depletion) enable sporulation completion with extreme energy efficiency: 0.73 mM ATP per mature spore versus 11.6 mM ATP under normal conditions--a 16-fold efficiency gain. Despite ATP dropping to 1 mM (99.7% depletion) during the crisis, continuous ATP regeneration rescues the system, producing 67 mM mature spores (89% of normal yield) with only 49 mM total ATP consumption. This efficiency emerges from the interplay between stochastic regulatory transitions and continuous metabolic sources, where GTP accumulation (+4974 mM, 166% increase) provides an energy buffer while ATP regeneration (+240 mM) prevents complete depletion. The hybrid Petri net formalism--combining stochastic transitions for regulatory events with continuous sources for metabolic flux--extended with thermodynamic constraints through inhibitor arcs and energy-coupled rate functions, provides the mathematical foundation enabling this discovery by integrating discrete regulatory logic with continuous energy dynamics in a resource-aware concurrency model.</description>

      <title>Cell size control in bacteria is modulated through extrinsic noise, single-cell- and population-growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living cells maintain size homeostasis by actively compensating for size fluctuations. Here, we present two stochastic maps that unify phenomenological models by integrating fluctuating single-cell growth rates and size-dependent noise mechanisms with cell size control. One map is applicable to mother machine lineages and the other to lineage trees of exponentially-growing cell populations, which reveals that population dynamics alter size control measured in mother machine experiments. For example, an adder can become more sizer-like or more timer-like at the population level depending on the noise statistics. Our analysis of bacterial data identifies extrinsic noise as the dominant mechanism of size variability, characterized by a quadratic conditional variance-mean relationship for division size across growth conditions. This finding contradicts the reported independence of added size relative to birth size but is consistent with the adder property in terms of the independence of the mean added size. Finally, we derive a trade-off between population-growth-rate gain and division-size noise. Correlations between size control quantifiers and single-cell growth rates inferred from data indicate that bacteria prioritize a narrow division-size distribution over growth rate maximisation.</description>
