      <title>$\Delta$-Nets: Interaction-Based System for Optimal Parallel $\lambda$-Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a model of universal parallel computation called $\Delta$-Nets, and a method to translate $\lambda$-terms into $\Delta$-nets and back. Together, the model and the method constitute an algorithm for optimal parallel $\lambda$-reduction, solving the longstanding enigma with groundbreaking clarity. I show that the $\lambda$-calculus can be understood as a projection of $\Delta$-Nets -- one that severely restricts the structure of sharing, among other drawbacks. Unhindered by these restrictions, the $\Delta$-Nets model opens the door to new highly parallel programming language implementations and computer architectures that are more efficient and performant than previously possible.</description>

      <title>INTERLEAVE: A Faster Symbolic Algorithm for Maximal End Component Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel symbolic algorithm for the Maximal End Component (MEC) decomposition of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The key idea behind our algorithm INTERLEAVE is to interleave the computation of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) with eager elimination of redundant state-action pairs, rather than performing these computations sequentially as done by existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Even though our approach has the same complexity as prior works, an empirical evaluation of INTERLEAVE on the standardized Quantitative Verification Benchmark Set demonstrates that it solves 19 more benchmarks (out of 379) than the closest previous algorithm. On the 149 benchmarks that prior approaches can solve, we demonstrate a 3.81x average speedup in runtime.</description>

      <title>Stopping Criteria for Value Iteration on Concurrent Stochastic Reachability and Safety Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-player zero-sum concurrent stochastic games (CSGs) played on graphs with reachability and safety objectives. These include degenerate classes such as Markov decision processes or turn-based stochastic games, which can be solved by linear or quadratic programming; however, in practice, value iteration (VI) outperforms the other approaches and is the most implemented method. Similarly, for CSGs, this practical performance makes VI an attractive alternative to the standard theoretical solution via the existential theory of reals.
  VI starts with an under-approximation of the sought values for each state and iteratively updates them, traditionally terminating once two consecutive approximations are $\epsilon$-close. However, this stopping criterion lacks guarantees on the precision of the approximation, which is the goal of this work. We provide bounded (a.k.a. interval) VI for CSGs: it complements standard VI with a converging sequence of over-approximations and terminates once the over- and under-approximations are $\epsilon$-close.</description>

      <title>Concrete Domains Meet Expressive Cardinality Restrictions in Description Logics (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Description Logics (DLs) can encode quantitative aspects of an application domain through either number restrictions, which constrain the number of individuals that are in a certain relationship with an individual, or concrete domains, which can be used to assign concrete values to individuals using so-called features. These two mechanisms have been extended towards very expressive DLs, for which reasoning nevertheless remains decidable. Number restrictions have been generalized to more powerful comparisons of sets of role successors in $\mathcal{ALCSCC}$, while the comparison of feature values of different individuals in $\mathcal{ALC}(\mathfrak{D})$ has been studied in the context of $\omega$-admissible concrete domains $\mathfrak{D}$. In this paper, we combine both formalisms and investigate the complexity of reasoning in the thus obtained DL $\mathcal{ALCOSCC}(\mathfrak{D})$, which additionally includes the ability to refer to specific individuals by name. We show that, in spite of its high expressivity, the consistency problem for this DL is ExpTime-complete, assuming that the constraint satisfaction problem of $\mathfrak{D}$ is also decidable in exponential time. It is thus not higher than the complexity of the basic DL $\mathcal{ALC}$. At the same time, we show that many natural extensions to this DL, including a tighter integration of the concrete domain and number restrictions, lead to undecidability.</description>

      <title>The flattening operator in team-based logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic study of the so-called flattening operator in team semantics. This operator was first introduced by Hodges in 1997, and has not been studied in more detail since. We begin a systematic study of the expressive power this operator adds to the most well-known team-based logics, such as dependence logic, anonymity logic, inclusion logic and exclusion logic.</description>

      <title>VeriThoughts: Enabling Automated Verilog Code Generation using Reasoning and Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces VeriThoughts, a novel dataset designed for reasoning-based Verilog code generation. We establish a new benchmark framework grounded in formal verification methods to evaluate the quality and correctness of generated hardware descriptions. Additionally, we present a suite of specialized small-scale models optimized specifically for Verilog generation. Our work addresses the growing need for automated hardware design tools that can produce verifiably correct implementations from high-level specifications, potentially accelerating the hardware development process while maintaining rigorous correctness guarantees. Our code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/wilyub/VeriThoughts}{this URL}.</description>

      <title>Reasoning in Neurosymbolic AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge representation and reasoning in neural networks have been a long-standing endeavor which has attracted much attention recently. The principled integration of reasoning and learning in neural networks is a main objective of the area of neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this chapter, a simple energy-based neurosymbolic AI system is described that can represent and reason formally about any propositional logic formula. This creates a powerful combination of learning from data and knowledge and logical reasoning. We start by positioning neurosymbolic AI in the context of the current AI landscape that is unsurprisingly dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify important challenges of data efficiency, fairness and safety of LLMs that might be addressed by neurosymbolic reasoning systems with formal reasoning capabilities. We then discuss the representation of logic by the specific energy-based system, including illustrative examples and empirical evaluation of the correspondence between logical reasoning and energy minimization using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Learning from data and knowledge is also evaluated empirically and compared with a symbolic, neural and a neurosymbolic system. Results reported in this chapter in an accessible way are expected to reignite the research on the use of neural networks as massively-parallel models for logical reasoning and promote the principled integration of reasoning and learning in deep networks. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the importance of positioning neurosymbolic AI within a broader framework of formal reasoning and accountability in AI, discussing the challenges for neurosynbolic AI to tackle the various known problems of reliability of deep learning.</description>

      <title>REAL-Prover: Retrieval Augmented Lean Prover for Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school and competition-level mathematics, but few of them generalize to more advanced mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).</description>

      <title>Thread and Memory-Safe Programming with CLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLASS is a proof-of-concept general purpose linear programming language, flexibly supporting realistic concurrent programming idioms, and featuring an expressive linear type system ensuring that programs (1) never misuse or leak stateful resources or memory, (2) never deadlock, and (3) always terminate. The design of CLASS and the strong static guarantees of its type system originates in its Linear Logic and proposition-as-types foundations. However, instead of focusing on its theoretical foundations, this paper briefly illustrates, in a tutorial form, an identifiable CLASS session-based programming style where strong correctness properties are automatically ensured by type-checking. Our more challenging examples include concurrent thread and memory-safe mutable ADTs, lazy stream programming, and manipulation of linear digital assets as used in smart contracts.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Implementation of Guard-Based Synchronization for an Object-Oriented Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the shared variable model of concurrency, guarded atomic actions restrict the possible interference between processes by regions of atomic execution. The guard specifies the condition for entering an atomic region. That is a convenient model for the specification and verification of concurrent programs, but has eschewed efficient execution so far. This article shows how guarded atomic actions, when attached to objects, can be implemented highly efficiently using a combination of coroutines, operating-system worker threads, and dedicated management of object queues and stacks. The efficiency of an experimental language, Lime, is shown to compare favourably with that of C/Pthreads, Go, Erlang, Java, and Haskell on synthetic benchmarks.

      <title>Full LTL Synthesis over Infinite-state Arenas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, interest has increased in applying reactive synthesis to richer-than-Boolean domains. A major (undecidable) challenge in this area is to establish when certain repeating behaviour terminates in a desired state when the number of steps is unbounded. Existing approaches struggle with this problem, or can handle at most deterministic games with B\"uchi goals. This work goes beyond by contributing the first effectual approach to synthesis with full LTL objectives, based on Boolean abstractions that encode both safety and liveness properties of the underlying infinite arena. We take a CEGAR approach: attempting synthesis on the Boolean abstraction, checking spuriousness of abstract counterstrategies through invariant checking, and refining the abstraction based on counterexamples. We reduce the complexity, when restricted to predicates, of abstracting and synthesising by an exponential through an efficient binary encoding. This also allows us to eagerly identify useful fairness properties. Our discrete synthesis tool outperforms the state-of-the-art on linear integer arithmetic (LIA) benchmarks from literature, solving almost double as many syntesis problems as the current state-of-the-art. It also solves slightly more problems than the second-best realisability checker, in one-third of the time. We also introduce benchmarks with richer objectives that other approaches cannot handle, and evaluate our tool on them.</description>

      <title>Elementary first-order model checking for sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that for subgraph-closed graph classes the first-order model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if the class is nowhere dense [Grohe, Kreutzer, Siebertz, STOC 2014]. However, the dependency on the formula size is non-elementary, and in fact, this is unavoidable even for the class of all trees [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002]. On the other hand, it is known that the dependency is elementary for classes of bounded degree [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002] as well as for classes of bounded pathwidth [Lampis, ICALP 2023]. In this paper we generalise these results and almost completely characterise subgraph-closed graph classes for which the model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size. Those are the graph classes for which there exists a number $d$ such that for every $r$, some tree of depth $d$ and size bounded by an elementary function of $r$ is avoided as an $({\leq} r)$-subdivision in all graphs in the class. In particular, this implies that if the class in question excludes a fixed tree as a topological minor, then first-order model checking for graphs in the class is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size.</description>

      <title>A Behavioral Theory for Distributed Systems with Weak Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12574v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed systems can be subject to various kinds of partial failures, therefore building fault-tolerance or failure mitigation mechanisms for distributed systems remains an important domain of research. In this paper, we present a calculus to formally model distributed systems subject to crash failures with recovery. The recovery model considered in the paper is weak, in the sense that it makes no assumption on the exact state in which a failed node resumes its execution, only its identity has to be distinguishable from past incarnations of itself. Our calculus is inspired in part by the Erlang programming language and in part by the distributed $\pi$-calculus with nodes and link failures (D$\pi$F) introduced by Francalanza and Hennessy. In order to reason about distributed systems with failures and recovery we develop a behavioral theory for our calculus, in the form of a contextual equivalence, and of a fully abstract coinductive characterization of this equivalence by means of a labelled transition system semantics and its associated weak bisimilarity. This result is valuable for it provides a compositional proof technique for proving or disproving contextual equivalence between systems.</description>

      <title>The Yoneda embedding in simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Riehl and Shulman introduced simplicial type theory (STT), a variant of homotopy type theory which aimed to study not just homotopy theory, but its fusion with category theory: $(\infty,1)$-category theory. While notoriously technical, manipulating $\infty$-categories in simplicial type theory is often easier than working with ordinary categories, with the type theory handling infinite stacks of coherences in the background. We capitalize on recent work by Gratzer et al. defining the $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-groupoids in STT to define presheaf categories within STT and systematically develop their theory. In particular, we construct the Yoneda embedding, prove the universal property of presheaf categories, refine the theory of adjunctions in STT, introduce the theory of Kan extensions, and prove Quillen's Theorem A.</description>

      <title>Transductions of Graph Classes Admitting Product Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a quest to thoroughly understand the first-order transduction hierarchy of hereditary graph classes, some questions in particular stand out; such as, what properties hold for graph classes that are first-order transductions of planar graphs (and of similar classes)? When addressing this (so-far wide open) question, we turn to the concept of a product structure - being a subgraph of the strong product of a path and a graph of bounded tree-width, introduced by Dujmovic et al. [JACM 2020]. Namely, we prove that any graph class which is a first-order transduction of a class admitting such product structure, up to perturbations also meets a structural description generalizing the concept of a product structure in a dense hereditary way - the latter concept being introduced just recently by Hlineny and Jedelsky under the name of H-clique-width [MFCS 2024]. Using this characterization, we show that the class of the 3D grids, as well as a class of certain modifications of 2D grids, are not first-order transducible from classes admitting a product structure, and in particular not from the class of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Faithful Logic Embeddings in HOL -- Deep and Shallow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep and shallow embeddings of non-classical logics in classical higher-order logic have been explored, implemented, and used in various reasoning tools in recent years. This paper presents a method for the simultaneous deployment of deep and shallow embeddings of various degrees in classical higher-order logic. This enables flexible, interactive and automated theorem proving and counterexample finding at meta and object level, as well as automated faithfulness proofs between these logic embeddings. The method is beneficial for logic education, research and application and is illustrated here using a simple propositional modal logic. However, this approach is conceptual in nature and not limited to this simple logical context.</description>

      <title>Domains, Information Frames, Rough Sets: An Equivalence of Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of Scott's information systems~\cite{sco82} is presented that captures exactly all continuous domains. The global consistency predicate in Scott's definition is relativized. Now, for every atomic statement, there is a consistency predicate that states which finite sets of statements express information that is consistent with the given statement. The category of information frames is shown to be equivalent to the category of domains. Moreover, the relationship with CF-approximation spaces introduced by Wu and Xu~\cite{wx23} is studied. The corresponding category is also shown to be equivalent with the category of information frames. This research achieves a refinement of the equivalence result of Wu and Xu of the category of CF-approximation spaces with the category of domains.</description>

      <title>EGGs are adhesive!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of rewriting-based visual formalisms is on the rise. In the formal methods community, this is due also to the introduction of adhesive categories, where most properties of classical approaches to graph transformation, such as those on parallelism and confluence, can be rephrased and proved in a general and uniform way.E-graphs (EGGs) are a formalism for program optimisation via an efficient implementation of equality saturation. In short, EGGs can be defined as (acyclic) term graphs with an additional notion of equivalence on nodes that is closed under the operators of the signature. Instead of replacing the components of a program, the optimisation step is performed by adding new components and linking them to the existing ones via an equivalence relation, until an optimal program is reached. This work describes EGGs via adhesive categories. Besides the benefits in itself of a formal presentation, which renders the properties of the data structure precise, the description of the addition of equivalent program components using standard graph transformation tools offers the advantages of the adhesive framework in modelling, for example, concurrent updates.</description>

      <title>From learnable objects to learnable random objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between learnability of a "base class" of functions on a set $X$, and learnability of a class of statistical functions derived from the base class. For example, we refine results showing that learnability of a family $h_p: p \in Y$ of functions implies learnability of the family of functions $h_\mu=\lambda p: Y. E_\mu(h_p)$, where $E_\mu$ is the expectation with respect to $\mu$, and $\mu$ ranges over probability distributions on $X$. We will look at both Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, where example inputs and outputs are chosen at random, and online learning, where the examples are chosen adversarily. For agnostic learning, we establish improved bounds on the sample complexity of learning for statistical classes, stated in terms of combinatorial dimensions of the base class. We connect these problems to techniques introduced in model theory for "randomizing a structure". We also provide counterexamples for realizable learning, in both the PAC and online settings.</description>

      <title>Flexible constraint satisfiability and a problem in semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.03127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability. We show the \texttt{NP}-completeness of $2$-robust monotone 1-in-3 3SAT in order to give very small examples of finite algebras with \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. In particular we give a $3$-element algebra with this property, and solve a widely stated problem by showing that the $6$-element Brandt monoid has \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. These are the smallest possible sizes for a general algebra and a semigroup to exhibit \texttt{NP}-hardness for the membership problem of finite algebras in finitely generated varieties.</description>

      <title>Determinisation and Unambiguisation of Polynomially-Ambiguous Rational Weighted Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the determinisation and unambiguisation problems of weighted automata over the rational field: Given a weighted automaton, can we determine whether there exists an equivalent deterministic, respectively unambiguous, weighted automaton? Recent results by Bell and Smertnig show that the problem is decidable, however they do not provide any complexity bounds. We show that both problems are in PSPACE for polynomially-ambiguous weighted automata.</description>

      <title>RvLLM: LLM Runtime Verification with Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However, their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner, supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks: violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.</description>
