      <title>Alpha rhythm slowing in temporal epilepsy across Scalp EEG and MEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG slowing is reported in various neurological disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Epilepsy. Here, we investigate alpha rhythm slowing in individuals with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), compared to healthy controls, using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).
  We retrospectively analysed data from 17,(46) healthy controls and 22,(24) individuals with TLE who underwent scalp EEG and (MEG) recordings as part of presurgical evaluation. Resting-state, eyes-closed recordings were source reconstructed using the standardized low-resolution brain electrographic tomography (sLORETA) method. We extracted low (slow) 6-9 Hz and high (fast) 10-11 Hz alpha relative band power and calculated the alpha power ratio by dividing low (slow) alpha by high (fast) alpha. This ratio was computed for all brain regions in all individuals.
  Alpha oscillations were slower in individuals with TLE than controls (p&lt;0.05). This effect was present in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, and across widespread brain regions.
  Alpha slowing in TLE was found in both EEG and MEG recordings. We interpret greater low (slow)-alpha as greater deviation from health.</description>

      <title>Information encoding and decoding in in-vitro neural networks on micro electrode arrays through stimulation timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary challenge in utilizing in-vitro biological neural networks for computations is finding good encoding and decoding schemes for inputting and decoding data to and from the networks. Furthermore, identifying the optimal parameter settings for a given combination of encoding and decoding schemes adds additional complexity to this challenge. In this study we explore stimulation timing as an encoding method, i.e. we encode information as the delay between stimulation pulses and identify the bounds and acuity of stimulation timings which produce linearly separable spike responses. We also examine the optimal readout parameters for a linear decoder in the form of epoch length, time bin size and epoch offset. Our results suggest that stimulation timings between 36 and 436ms may be optimal for encoding and that different combinations of readout parameters may be optimal at different parts of the evoked spike response.</description>

      <title>A computational account of the development and evolution of psychotic symptoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms of psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions are often investigated in fully-formed illness, well after symptoms emerge. These investigations have yielded key insights, but are not well-positioned to reveal the dynamic forces underlying symptom formation itself. Understanding symptom development over time would allow us to identify steps in the pathophysiological process leading to psychosis, shifting the focus of psychiatric intervention from symptom alleviation to prevention. We propose a model for understanding the emergence of psychotic symptoms within the context of an adaptive, developing neural system. We will make the case for a pathophysiological process that begins with cortical hyperexcitability and bottom-up noise transmission, which engenders inappropriate belief formation via aberrant prediction error signaling. We will argue that this bottom-up noise drives learning about the (im)precision of new incoming sensory information because of diminished signal-to-noise ratio, causing an adaptive relative over-reliance on prior beliefs. This over-reliance on priors predisposes to hallucinations and covaries with hallucination severity. An over-reliance on priors may also lead to increased conviction in the beliefs generated by bottom-up noise and drive movement toward conversion to psychosis. We will identify predictions of our model at each stage, examine evidence to support or refute those predictions, and propose experiments that could falsify or help select between alternative elements of the overall model. Nesting computational abnormalities within longitudinal development allows us to account for hidden dynamics among the mechanisms driving symptom formation and to view established symptomatology as a point of equilibrium among competing biological forces.</description>

      <title>Functional Brain-to-Brain Transformation with No Shared Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining Functional MRI (fMRI) data across different subjects and datasets is crucial for many neuroscience tasks. Relying solely on shared anatomy for brain-to-brain mapping is inadequate. Existing functional transformation methods thus depend on shared stimuli across subjects and fMRI datasets, which are often unavailable. In this paper, we propose an approach for computing functional brain-to-brain transformations without any shared data, a feat not previously achieved in functional transformations. This presents exciting research prospects for merging and enriching diverse datasets, even when they involve distinct stimuli that were collected using different fMRI machines of varying resolutions (e.g., 3-Tesla and 7-Tesla). Our approach combines brain-to-brain transformation with image-to-fMRI encoders, thus enabling to learn functional transformations on stimuli to which subjects were never exposed. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method for improving image-to-fMRI encoding of subjects scanned on older low-resolution 3T fMRI datasets, by using a new high-resolution 7T fMRI dataset (scanned on different subjects and different stimuli).</description>

      <title>The mind-brain relationship and the perspective of meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We view the mind-body problem in terms of the two interconnected problems of phenomenal consciousness and mental causation, namely, how subjective conscious experience can arise from physical neurological processes and how conscious mental states can causally act upon the physical world. In order to address these problems, I develop here a non-physicalist framework that combines two apparently antithetical views: the materialist view of the mind as a product of the brain and the metaphysical view of consciousness rooted in an underlying hidden reality. I discuss how this framework resolves the problem of mental causation while being simultaneously consistent with fundamental physical principles. I will elucidate how the framework ties in to the perspective of meaning that acts as the bridge between physical neurological processes and the conscious mind. Moreover, we will see how both our awareness of the self and our representation of the external world are connected to this perspective.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between predictive coding and backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.13082v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks are often interpreted as abstract models of biological neuronal networks, but they are typically trained using the biologically unrealistic backpropagation algorithm and its variants. Predictive coding has been proposed as a potentially more biologically realistic alternative to backpropagation for training neural networks. This manuscript reviews and extends recent work on the mathematical relationship between predictive coding and backpropagation for training feedforward artificial neural networks on supervised learning tasks. Implications of these results for the interpretation of predictive coding and deep neural networks as models of biological learning are discussed along with a repository of functions, Torch2PC, for performing predictive coding with PyTorch neural network models.</description>
