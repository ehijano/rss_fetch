      <title>Corrigendum to "$m$-Periodic Gorenstein objects" [J. Algebra 621 (2023)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A,B})$ be a GP-admissible pair and $(\mathcal{Z,W})$ be a GI-admissible pair of classes of objects in an abelian category $\mathcal{C}$, and consider the class $\pi\mathcal{GP}_{(\omega,\mathcal{B},1)}$ of $1$-periodic $(\omega,\mathcal{B})$-Gorenstein projective objects, where $\omega := \mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B}$ and $\nu := \mathcal{Z} \cap \mathcal{W}$. We claimed in \cite[Lem. 8.1]{HMP2023m} that the $(\mathcal{Z,W})$-Gorenstein injective dimension of $\pi\mathcal{GP}_{(\omega,\mathcal{B},1)}$ is bounded by the $(\mathcal{Z,W})$-Gorenstein injective dimension of $\omega$, provided that: (1) $\omega$ is closed under direct summands, (2) $\mathrm{Ext}^1(\pi\mathcal{GP}_{(\omega,\mathcal{B},1)},\nu) = 0$, and (3) every object in $\pi\mathcal{GP}_{(\omega,\mathcal{B},1)}$ admits a $\mathrm{Hom}(-,\nu)$-acyclic $\nu$-coresolution. These conditions are their duals are part of what we called ``Setup 1''. Moreover, if we replace $\pi\mathcal{GP}_{(\omega,\mathcal{B},1)}$ by the class $\mathcal{GP}_{(\mathcal{A,B})}$ of $(\mathcal{A,B})$-Gorenstein projective objects, the resulting inequality is claimed to be true under a set of conditions named ``Setup 2''.
  The proof we gave for the claims $\mathrm{Gid}_{(\mathcal{Z,W})}(\pi\mathcal{GP}_{(\omega,\mathcal{B},1)}) \leq \mathrm{Gid}_{(\mathcal{Z,W})}(\omega)$ and $\mathrm{Gid}_{(\mathcal{Z,W})}(\mathcal{GP}_{(\mathcal{A,B})}) \leq \mathrm{Gid}_{(\mathcal{Z,W})}(\omega)$ is incorrect, and the purpose of this note is to exhibit a corrected proof of the first inequality, under the additional assumption that every object in $\pi\mathcal{GP}_{(\omega,\mathcal{B},1)}$ has finite injective dimension relative to $\mathcal{Z}$. Setup 2 is no longer required, and as a result the second inequality was removed. We also fix those results in \S \ 8 of \cite{HMP2023m} affected by Lemma 8.1, and comment some applications and examples.</description>

      <title>Higher structures for Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a cocommutative Hopf algebra. The notion of Lie $H$-pseudoalgebra is a multivariable generalization of Lie conformal algebras. In this paper, we study some higher structures related to Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras where we increase the flexibility of the Jacobi identity. Namely, we first introduce $L_\infty$ $H$-pseudoalgebras (also called strongly homotopy Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras) as the homotopy analogue of Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras. We give several equivalent descriptions of such homotopy algebras and show that some particular classes of these homotopy algebras are closely related to the cohomology of Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras and crossed modules of Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras. Next, we introduce another higher structure, called Lie-$2$ $H$-pseudoalgebras which are the categorification of Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras. Finally, we show that the category of Lie-$2$ $H$-pseudoalgebras is equivalent to the category of certain $L_\infty$ $H$-pseudoalgebras.</description>

      <title>Research on Personal Credit Risk Assessment Methods Based on Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discussion on causality in human history dates back to ancient Greece, yet to this day, there is still no consensus. Fundamentally, this stems from the nature of human cognition, as understanding causality requires abstract tools to transcend the limitations of human cognition. In recent decades, the rapid development of mathematical and computational tools has provided new theoretical and technical means for exploring causality, creating more avenues for investigation.
  Based on this, this paper introduces a new definition of causality using category theory, proposed by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in 1945 to avoid the self-referential contradictions in set theory, notably the Russell paradox. Within this framework, the feasibility of indicator synthesis in causal inference is demonstrated. Due to the limitations in the development of category theory-related technical tools, this paper adopts the widely-used probabilistic causal graph tool proposed by Judea Pearl in 1995 to study the application of causal inference in personal credit risk management. The specific work includes: research on the construction method of causal inference index system, definition of causality and feasibility proof of indicator synthesis causal inference within this framework, application methods of causal graph model and intervention alternative criteria in personal credit risk management, and so on.</description>

      <title>An equivalence between two models of $\infty$-categories of enriched presheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O} \to \mathrm{BM}$ be a $ \mathrm{BM}$-operad that exhibits an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{D}$ as weakly bitensored over non-symmetric $\infty$-operads $\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-precategory. We construct an equivalence $$\mathrm{Fun}_{\mathrm{Hin}}^{\mathcal{V}}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}) \simeq \mathrm{Fun}^{\mathcal{V}}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}) $$ of $\infty$-categories weakly right tensored over $\mathcal{W}$ between two different models of $\infty$-categories of $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functors, one introduced by Hinich and one constructed by us.</description>

      <title>Opposites of weak $\omega$-categories and the suspension and hom adjunction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define inductively the opposites of a weak globular $\omega$\-category with respect to a set of dimensions, and we show that the properties of being free on a globular set or a computad are preserved under forming opposites. We then provide a new description of the hom functor on $\omega$\-categories, and we show that it admits a left adjoint that we construct explicitly and call the suspension functor. We also show that the hom functor preserves the property of being free on computad, and that the opposites of a hom $\omega$\-category are hom $\omega$\-categories of opposites of the original $\omega$\-category.</description>

      <title>Sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a functorial presentation of the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $(n, r)$-categories for all $-2 \leq n\leq\infty$ and $0 \leq r\leq n+2$ based on complete Segal space objects. In this definition, the equivalences of sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories are defined inductively, so we also provide a localisation at the coinductive equivalences to define the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $\omega$-categories as well. We prove that the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories and the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $\omega$-categories both define distributors over the underlying topos of sheaves of spaces. Moreover, we show that these distributors define terminal and initial fixed points with respect to the construction of complete Segal space objects in a distributor. We conclude with a sheafification result: the category of sheaves of $(n, r)$-categories over a site $\mathscr{C}$ can be presented as a strongly reflective localisation of $\mathbf{Fun}(\mathscr{C}^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Cat}_{(n, r)})$, where the localisation functor preserves fibre products over $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathscr{C})$, with the analogous result also holding for sheaves of $\omega$-categories.</description>

      <title>Infinity categories with duality and hermitian multiplicative infinite loop space machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:1610.10043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any preadditive infinity category with duality gives rise to a direct sum hermitian K-theory spectrum. This assignment is lax symmetric monoidal, thereby producing E-infinity ring spectra from preadditive symmetric monoidal infinity categories with duality. To have examples of preadditive symmetric monoidal infinity categories with duality we show that any preadditive symmetric monoidal infinity category, in which every object admits a dual, carries a canonical duality. Moreover we classify and twist the dualities in various ways and apply our definitions for example to finitely generated projective modules over E-infinity ring spectra.</description>

      <title>Categorifying computable reducibilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents categorical formulations of Turing, Medvedev, Muchnik, and Weihrauch reducibilities in Computability Theory, utilizing Lawvere doctrines. While the first notions lend themselves to a smooth categorical presentation, essentially dualizing the traditional notion of realizability doctrines, Weihrauch reducibility and its extensions for represented and multi-represented spaces require a thorough investigation and the formulation of a new appropriate extension of the category of assemblies as a foundation for the respective doctrine.
  Our abstract analysis of these concepts highlights a shared characteristic among all these reducibilities. Specifically, we demonstrate that all these doctrines stemming from computability concepts can be proven to be instances of completions of quantifiers for doctrines, analogous to what occurs for doctrines for realizability.
  As a corollary of these results, we will be formally able to compare Weihrauch reducibility with the dialectica doctrine constructed from a doctrine representing Turing degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give complete presentations for the dagger-compact props of affine Lagrangian and coisotropic relations over an arbitrary field. This provides a unified family of graphical languages for both affinely constrained classical mechanical systems, as well as odd-prime-dimensional stabiliser quantum circuits. To this end, we present affine Lagrangian relations by a particular class of undirected coloured graphs. In order to reason about composite systems, we introduce a powerful scalable notation where the vertices of these graphs are themselves coloured by graphs. In the setting of stabiliser quantum mechanics, this scalable notation gives an extremely concise description of graph states, which can be composed via ``phased spider fusion.'' Likewise, in the classical mechanical setting of electrical circuits, we show that impedance matrices for reciprocal networks are presented in essentially the same way.</description>

      <title>Complete equational theories for classical and quantum Gaussian relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian relations and positive affine Lagrangian relations. The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.
  The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. Using this graphical calculus, we also give a graphical proof of Braunstein and Kimble's continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol. We also interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our graphical calculus. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.</description>
