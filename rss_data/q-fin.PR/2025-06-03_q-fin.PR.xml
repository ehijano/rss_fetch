      <title>A framework for the valuation of insurance liabilities by production cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper sets out a framework for the valuation of insurance liabilities that is intended to be economically realistic, elementary, reasonably practically applicable, and as a special case to provide a basis for the valuation in regulatory solvency systems such as Solvency II and the SST. The valuation framework is based on the cost of producing the liabilities to an insurance company that is subject to solvency regulation (regulatory solvency capital requirements) and insolvency laws (consequences of failure) in finite discrete time. Starting from the replication approach of classical no-arbitrage theory, the framework additionally considers the nature and cost of capital (expressed by a ``financiability condition"), that the liabilities may be required to be fulfilled only ``in sufficiently many cases" (expressed by a ``fulfillment condition"), production using ``fully illiquid" assets in addition to tradables, and the asymmetry between assets and liabilities. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions on the capital investment under which the framework recovers the market prices of tradables, investigate extending production to take account of insolvency, implications of using illiquid assets in the production, and show how Solvency II and SST valuation can be derived with specific assumptions.</description>

      <title>Signature volatility models: pricing and hedging with Fourier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic volatility model where the dynamics of the volatility are given by a possibly infinite linear combination of the elements of the time extended signature of a Brownian motion. First, we show that the model is remarkably universal, as it includes, but is not limited to, the celebrated Stein-Stein, Bergomi, and Heston models, together with some path-dependent variants. Second, we derive the joint characteristic functional of the log-price and integrated variance provided that some infinite dimensional extended tensor algebra valued Riccati equation admits a solution. This allows us to price and (quadratically) hedge certain European and path-dependent options using Fourier inversion techniques. We highlight the efficiency and accuracy of these Fourier techniques in a comprehensive numerical study.</description>
