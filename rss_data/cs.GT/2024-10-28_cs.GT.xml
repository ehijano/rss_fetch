      <title>Local hedging approximately solves Pandora's box problems with nonobligatory inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider search problems with nonobligatory inspection and single-item or combinatorial selection. A decision maker is presented with a number of items, each of which contains an unknown price, and can pay an inspection cost to observe the item's price before selecting it. Under single-item selection, the decision maker must select one item; under combinatorial selection, the decision maker must select a set of items that satisfies certain constraints. In our nonobligatory inspection setting, the decision maker can select items without first inspecting them. It is well-known that search with nonobligatory inspection is harder than the well-studied obligatory inspection case, for which the optimal policy for single-item selection (Weitzman, 1979) and approximation algorithms for combinatorial selection (Singla, 2018) are known.
  We introduce a technique, local hedging, for constructing policies with good approximation ratios in the nonobligatory inspection setting. Local hedging transforms policies for the obligatory inspection setting into policies for the nonobligatory inspection setting, at the cost of an extra factor in the approximation ratio. The factor is instance-dependent but is at most 4/3. We thus obtain the first approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial selection problems, including matroid basis, matching, and facility location.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Value of Revert Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revert protection is a feature provided by some blockchain platforms that prevents users from incurring fees for failed transactions. This paper explores the economic implications and benefits of revert protection, in the context of priority auctions and maximal extractable value (MEV). We develop an equilibrium game theoretic model that captures the behavior of users (MEV searchers) bidding to have their transaction included ahead of others, in an environment where only a single transaction will succeed in realizing the common value of an opportunity, and in settings both with and without revert protection. Our model applies to a broad range of settings, including Layer 1 (L1) blockchains (e.g., Ethereum mainnet) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains, and auctions such as ``bundle auctions'' (on L1s) or priority ordering auctions (on L2s).
  We establish that, in the absence of revert protection, users will employ randomized strategies to mitigate the impact of paying for failed transactions. This will ultimately result in less auction revenue, despite the fact that failed transactions still pay fees. Our results quantify in closed form how revert protection enhances auction revenue, and also improves market efficiency and provides for more efficient use of blockspace, as a function of the underlying parameters (the value of the MEV opportunity, the base fee, the revert penalties, and the number of participating agents).</description>

      <title>Fairness and Efficiency in Online Class Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online bipartite matching problem, extensively studied in the literature, deals with the allocation of online arriving vertices (items) to a predetermined set of offline vertices (agents). However, little attention has been given to the concept of class fairness, where agents are categorized into different classes, and the matching algorithm must ensure equitable distribution across these classes.
  We here focus on randomized algorithms for the fair matching of indivisible items, subject to various definitions of fairness. Our main contribution is the first (randomized) non-wasteful algorithm that simultaneously achieves a $1/2$ approximation to class envy-freeness (CEF) while simultaneously ensuring an equivalent approximation to the class proportionality (CPROP) and utilitarian social welfare (USW) objectives. We supplement this result by demonstrating that no non-wasteful algorithm can achieve an $\alpha$-CEF guarantee for $\alpha &gt; 0.761$. In a similar vein, we provide a novel input instance for deterministic divisible matching that demonstrates a nearly tight CEF approximation.
  Lastly, we define the ``price of fairness,'' which represents the trade-off between optimal and fair matching. We demonstrate that increasing the level of fairness in the approximation of the solution leads to a decrease in the objective of maximizing USW, following an inverse proportionality relationship.</description>

      <title>Free-Rider and Conflict Aware Collaboration Formation for Cross-Silo Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19321v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple FL participants (FL-PTs) to collaborate on training models without sharing private data. Due to data heterogeneity, negative transfer may occur in the FL training process. This necessitates FL-PT selection based on their data complementarity. In cross-silo FL, organizations that engage in business activities are key sources of FL-PTs. The resulting FL ecosystem has two features: (i) self-interest, and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. This requires the desirable FL-PT selection strategy to simultaneously mitigate the problems of free riders and conflicts of interest among competitors. To this end, we propose an optimal FL collaboration formation strategy -- FedEgoists -- which ensures that: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from FL if and only if it benefits the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors or their supporters. It provides an efficient clustering solution to group FL-PTs into coalitions, ensuring that within each coalition, FL-PTs share the same interest. We theoretically prove that the FL-PT coalitions formed are optimal since no coalitions can collaborate together to improve the utility of any of their members. Extensive experiments on widely adopted benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEgoists compared to nine state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silos FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Linear Utility Functions for Monetary Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of expected utility with state-dependent linear utility function for monetary returns, that includes results on first order stochastic dominance, mean-preserving spread, increasing-concave linear utility profiles and risk aversion. As an application of the expected utility theory developed here, we analyze the contract that a monopolist would offer in an insurance market that allowed for partial coverage of loss. We also define a utility function for monetary returns that in a certain sense reconciles state-dependent constant average utility of money with loss aversion and the Friedman-Savage hypothesis. As an immediate consequence of such a utility function, we obtain a profile of state-dependent linear utility functions for monetary returns, where states of nature correspond to mutually disjoint intervals in which monetary gains and losses may occur.</description>

      <title>MetaTrading: An Immersion-Aware Model Trading Framework for Vehicular Metaverse Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Updates of extensive Internet of Things (IoT) data are critical to the immersion of vehicular metaverse services. However, providing high-quality and sustainable data in unstable and resource-constrained vehicular networks remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, we put forth a novel immersion-aware model trading framework that incentivizes metaverse users (MUs) to contribute learning models trained by their latest local data for augmented reality (AR) services in the vehicular metaverse, while preserving their privacy through federated learning. To comprehensively evaluate the contribution of locally trained learning models provided by MUs to AR services, we design a new immersion metric that captures service immersion by considering the freshness and accuracy of learning models, as well as the amount and potential value of raw data used for training. We model the trading interactions between metaverse service providers (MSPs) and MUs as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to analyze and balance their costs and gains. Moreover, considering dynamic network conditions and privacy concerns, we formulate the reward decisions of MSPs as a multi-agent Markov decision process. Then, a fully distributed dynamic reward method based on deep reinforcement learning is presented, which operates without any private information about MUs and other MSPs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively provide higher-value models for object detection and classification in AR services on real AR-related vehicle datasets compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Time-Efficient Algorithms for Nash-Bargaining-Based Matching Market Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.02024v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the area of matching-based market design, existing models using cardinal utilities suffer from two deficiencies: First, the Hylland-Zeckhauser (HZ) mechanism, which has remained a classic in economics for one-sided matching markets, is intractable; computation of even an approximate equilibrium is PPAD-complete. Second, there is an extreme paucity of such models. This led Hosseini and Vazirani (2022) to define a rich collection of Nash-bargaining-based models for one-sided and two-sided matching markets, in both Fisher and Arrow-Debreu settings, together with very fast implementations using available solvers and very encouraging experimental results.
  In this paper, we give fast algorithms with proven running times for the models introduced by Hosseini and Vazirani, using the techniques of multiplicative weights update (MWU) and conditional gradient descent (CGD). Additionally, we make the following contributions:
  (1) By Tr\"obst and Vazirani (2024), a linear one-sided Nash-bargaining-based matching market satisfies envy-freeness within factor two. We show that the other models satisfy approximate equal-share fairness, where the exact factor depends on the utility function being used in the particular model.
  (2) We define a Nash-bargaining-based model for non-bipartite matching markets and give fast algorithms for it using conditional gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Smooth Information Gathering in Two-Player Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for modeling two-player noncooperative games in which one player is uncertain of the other player's costs but can preemptively allocate information-gathering resources to reduce this uncertainty. We refer to the players as the uncertain player (UP) and the certain player (CP), respectively. We obtain UP's decisions by solving a two-stage problem where, in Stage 1, UP allocates information-gathering resources that smoothly transform the information structure in the second stage. Then, in Stage 2, a signal (that is, a function of the Stage 1 allocation) informs UP about CP's costs, and both players execute strategies which depend upon the signal's value. This framework allows for a smooth resource allocation, in contrast to existing literature on the topic. We also identify conditions under which the gradient of UP's overall cost with respect to the information-gathering resources is well-defined. Then we provide a gradient-based algorithm to solve the two-stage game. Finally, we apply our framework to a tower-defense game which can be interpreted as a variant of a Colonel Blotto game with smooth payoff functions and uncertainty over battlefield valuations. We include an analysis of how optimal decisions shift with changes in information-gathering allocations and perturbations in the cost functions.</description>

      <title>Evolution with Opponent-Learning Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are usually constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. In this paper, we study how large heterogeneous populations of learning agents evolve in normal-form games. We show how, under assumptions commonly made in the multi-armed bandit literature, Multi-Agent Policy Gradient closely resembles the Replicator Dynamic, and we further derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Opponent-Learning Awareness tailored for evolutionary simulations. This enables us to simulate the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. We demonstrate our approach in simulations of 200,000 agents, evolving in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game highlights distinct ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects evolution.</description>

      <title>The Double-Edged Sword of Behavioral Responses in Strategic Classification: Theory and User Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When humans are subject to an algorithmic decision system, they can strategically adjust their behavior accordingly (``game'' the system). While a growing line of literature on strategic classification has used game-theoretic modeling to understand and mitigate such gaming, these existing works consider standard models of fully rational agents. In this paper, we propose a strategic classification model that considers behavioral biases in human responses to algorithms. We show how misperceptions of a classifier (specifically, of its feature weights) can lead to different types of discrepancies between biased and rational agents' responses, and identify when behavioral agents over- or under-invest in different features. We also show that strategic agents with behavioral biases can benefit or (perhaps, unexpectedly) harm the firm compared to fully rational strategic agents. We complement our analytical results with user studies, which support our hypothesis of behavioral biases in human responses to the algorithm. Together, our findings highlight the need to account for human (cognitive) biases when designing AI systems, and providing explanations of them, to strategic human in the loop.</description>
