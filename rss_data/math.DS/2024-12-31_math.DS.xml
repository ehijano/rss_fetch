      <title>Stochastic Stability of Monotone Dynamical Systems. I. The Irreducible Cooperative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current series of papers is concerned with stochastic stability of monotone dynamical systems by identifying the basic dynamical units that can survive in the presence of noise interference. In the first of the series, for the cooperative and irreducible systems, we will establish the stochastic stability of a dynamical order, that is, the zero-noise limit of stochastic perturbations will be concentrated on a simply ordered set consisting of Lyapunov stable equilibria. In particular, we utilize the Freidlin--Wentzell large deviation theory to gauge the rare probability in the vicinity of unordered chain-transitive invariant set on a nonmonotone manifold. We further apply our theoretic results to the stochastic stability of classical positive feedback systems by showing that the zero-noise limit is a convex combination of the Dirac measures on a finite number of asymptotically stable equilibria although such system may possess nontrivial periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Parameter spaces for cross-diffusive-driven instability in a reaction-diffusion system on an annular domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the influence of geometry and domain size on spatiotemporal pattern formation is investigated to establish parameter spaces for a cross-diffusive reaction-diffusion model on an annulus. By applying linear stability theory, we derive conditions which can give rise to Turing, Hopf and transcritical types of diffusion-driven instabilities. We explore whether selection of a sufficiently large domain size, together with the appropriate selection of parameters, can give rise to the development of patterns on non-convex geometries e.g. annulus. Hence, the key research methodology and outcomes of our studies include: a complete analytical exploration of the spatiotemporal dynamics in an activator-depleted reaction-diffusion system; a linear stability analysis to characterise the dual roles of cross-diffusion and domain size of pattern formation on an annulus region; the derivation of the instability conditions through lower and upper bounds of the domain size; the full classification of the model parameters, and a demonstration of how cross-diffusion relaxes the general conditions for the reaction-diffusion system to exhibit pattern formation. To validate theoretical findings and predictions, we employ the finite element method to reveal spatial and spatiotemporal patterns in the dynamics of the cross-diffusive reaction-diffusion system within a two-dimensional annular domain. These observed patterns resemble those found in ring-shaped cross-sectional scans of hypoxic tumours. Specifically, the cross-section of an actively invasive region in a hypoxic tumour can be effectively approximated by an annulus.</description>

      <title>On convergence of Thurston's iteration for transcendental entire functions with infinite post-singular set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an entire function $f_0$ with finitely many singular values, one can construct a quasiregular function $f$ by post-composing $f_0$ with a quasiconformal map equal to identity on some open set $U\ni\infty$. It might happen that the $f$-orbits of all singular values of $f$ are eventually contained in $U$. The goal of this article is to investigate properties of Thurston's pull-back map $\sigma$ associated to such $f$, especially in the case when $f$ is post-singularly infinite, that is, when $\sigma$ acts on an infinite-dimensional Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}$.
  The main result yields sufficient conditions for existence of a $\sigma$-invariant set $\mathcal{I}\subset\mathcal{T}$ such that its projection to the subspace of $\mathcal{T}$ associated to marked points in $\mathbb{C}\setminus U$ is bounded in the Teichm\"uller metric, while the projection to the subspace associated to the marked points in $U$ (generally there are infinitely many) is a small perturbation of identity. The notion of a ``fat spider'' is defined and used as a dynamically meaningful way define coordinates in the Teichm\"uller space.
  The notion of ``asymptotic area property'' for entire functions is introduced. Roughly, it requires that the complement of logarithmic tracts in $U$ degenerates fast as $U$ shrinks. A corollary of the main result is that for a finite order entire function, if the degeneration is fast enough and singular values of $f$ escape fast, then $f$ is Thurston equivalent to an entire function.</description>

      <title>The Black Rabbits of Fibonacci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we use a toy problem of detecting cycles of length two in a tent map to highlight some curious phenomena in the behavior of discrete dynamical systems. This work presents no new results or proofs, only computer experiments and illustrations. Thus, it serves as light reading and does not aim to be a scientific paper but is rather educational in nature. For this reason it is accompanied by numerous illustrations.</description>

      <title>Correlation Number for Potentials with Entropy Gaps and Cusped Hitchin Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a correlation number for two strictly positive, locally H\"older continuous, independent potentials with strong entropy gaps at infinity on a topologically mixing countable state Markov shift with BIP. We define in this way a correlation number for pairs of cusped Hitchin representations. Furthermore, we explore the connection between the correlation number and the Manhattan curve, along with several rigidity properties of this correlation number.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Selberg zeta function to study the limit behavior of resonances in a degenerating family of Kleinian Schottky groups. We prove that, after a suitable rescaling, the Selberg zeta functions converge to the Ihara zeta function of a limiting finite graph associated to the relevant non-Archimedean Schottky group acting on the Berkovich projective line.
  Moreover, we show that these techniques can be used to get an exponential error term in a result of McMullen (recently extended by Dang and Mehmeti) about the asymptotics for the vanishing rate of the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets of certain degenerating Schottky groups generating symmetric three-funnel surfaces. Here, one key idea is to introduce an intermediate zeta function capturing \emph{both} non-Archimedean and Archimedean information (while the traditional Selberg, resp. Ihara zeta functions concern only Archimedean, resp. non-Archimedean properties).</description>

      <title>Asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first step in investigating fractional difference maps, which do not have periodic points except fixed points, is to find asymptotically periodic points and bifurcation points and draw asymptotic bifurcation diagrams. Recently derived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points contain coefficients defined as slowly converging infinite sums. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for coefficients of the equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps.</description>

      <title>Weak mixing behavior for the projectivized derivative extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both smooth and analytic categories, we construct examples of diffeomorphisms of topological entropy zero with intricate ergodic properties. On any smooth compact connected manifold of dimension 2 admitting a nontrivial circle action, we construct a smooth diffeomorphism whose differential is weakly mixing with respect to a smooth measure in the projectivization of the tangent bundle. In case of the 2-torus, we also obtain the analytic counterpart of such a diffeomorphism. The constructions are based on a quantitative version of the ``Approximation by Conjugation'' method, which involves explicitly defined conjugation maps, partial partitions, and the adaptation of a specific analytic approximation technique.</description>

      <title>On the ergodicity of anti-symmetric skew products with singularities and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for proving ergodicity for skew products of interval exchange transformations (IETs) with piecewise smooth cocycles having singularities at the ends of exchanged intervals. This approach is inspired by Borel-Cantelli-type arguments from Fayad and Lema\'nczyk (2006). The key innovation of our method lies in its applicability to singularities beyond the logarithmic type, whereas previous techniques were restricted to logarithmic singularities. Our approach is particularly effective for proving the ergodicity of skew products for symmetric IETs and antisymmetric cocycles. Moreover, its most significant advantage is its ability to study the equidistribution of error terms in the spectral decomposition of Birkhoff integrals for locally Hamiltonian flows on compact surfaces, applicable not only when all saddles are perfect (harmonic) but also in the case of some non-perfect saddles.</description>

      <title>Perfect stationary solutions of reaction-diffusion equations on lattices and regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion equations on infinite graphs can have an infinite number of stationary solutions. These solutions are generally described as roots of a countable system of algebraic equations. As a generalization of periodic stationary solutions we present perfect stationary solutions, a special class of solutions with finite range in which the neighborhood values are determined precisely by the value of the central vertex. The focus on the solutions which attain a finite number of values enables us to rewrite the countable algebraic system to a finite one. In this work, we define the notion of perfect stationary solutions and show its elementary properties. We further present results from the theory of perfect colorings in order to prove the existence of the solutions in the square, triangular and hexagonal grids; as a byproduct, the existence of uncountable number of two-valued stationary solutions on these grids is shown. These two-valued solutions can form highly aperiodic and highly irregular patterns. Finally, an application to a bistable reaction-diffusion equation on a square grid is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct homeomorphisms of compacta from relations between finite graphs representing their open covers. Applied to the pseudoarc, this yields simple Fra\"iss\'e theoretic proofs of several important results, both old and new. Specifically, we recover Bing's classic results on the uniqueness and homogeneity of the pseudoarc. We also show that the autohomeomorphism group of the pseudoarc has a dense conjugacy class, thus confirming a conjecture of Kwiatkowska.</description>

      <title>Regime dependent infection propagation fronts in an SIS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of traveling front solutions in a diffusive classical SIS epidemic model and the SIS model with a saturating incidence in the size of the susceptible population. We investigate the situation where both susceptible and infected populations move around at a comparable rates, but small compared to the spatial scale. In this case, we show that traveling front solutions exist for each fixed positive speed. In the regime where the infected population diffuses slower than the susceptible population, we show the existence of traveling wave solutions for each fixed positive speed and describe their structure and dependence on the wave speed which as it is varied from 0 to infinity. In the regime where the infected population diffuses faster than the susceptible population, we derive a bound for the speeds of the fronts in this regime in which the infection propagates as a front. Moreover, for the classical SIS model we show that there is a case when the spread of the disease is governed by the Burgers-FKPP equation.</description>

      <title>On the uniformity and size of microsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve a few questions regarding the uniformity and size of microsets of subsets of Euclidean space. First, we construct a compact set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with Assouad dimension arbitrarily close to $d$ such that every microset of $K$ has no Ahlfors--David regular subset with dimension strictly larger than $0$. This answers a question of Orponen. Then, we show that for any non-empty compact set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with lower dimension $\beta$, there is a microset $E$ of $K$ with finite $\beta$-dimensional packing pre-measure. This answers a strong version of a question of Fraser--Howroyd--K\"aenm\"aki--Yu, who previously obtained a similar result concerning the upper box dimension.</description>

      <title>Chaos synchronization: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides a self-contained comprehensive review of the phenomenon of synchronization in dynamical systems, with a particular focus on chaotic systems in both continuous-time and discrete-time contexts. Synchronization, initially observed by Christiaan Huygens in 1665, has evolved from the study of periodic signals to encompass chaotic systems, where the sensitive dependence on initial conditions poses unique challenges. This review pointed to both theoretical foundations and contributions (concepts and methods) and practical insights, reinforcing the relevance of chaos synchronization in physics, biology, engineering, social sciences, economics and communication systems. The study investigates various coupling schemes, such as unidirectional and bidirectional coupling, and presents stability criteria under different configurations. In a very concise way, some ongoing research carried out by the authors is also indicated, using Lorenz, Rossler and hyperchaotic Rossler systems, and quadratic maps as case studies with parameter values leading to chaotic behavior. Special attention is given to the stability of synchronized states and the role of multi-stability and bifurcations, and its implications to loss of synchronization. We highlight the role of Lyapunov exponents, eigenvalues, and Lyapunov functions in guaranteeing local and global stability of the synchronized state. We aim to contribute to a broader understanding of chaos synchronization and its practical applications in diverse fields of knowledge. This text shed light on the control and stability of coupled chaotic systems, offering new perspectives on the synchronization of non-identical systems and the emergence of complex synchronization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Contact instantons and Proofs of Weinstein's conjecture and Arnold's chord conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is a continuation of the study of the interplay between the contact Hamiltonian dynamics and the moduli theory of (perturbed) contact instantons and its applications initiated in [Oh21b, Oh22a]. In this paper we prove Weinstein's conjecture and Arnold's chord conjecture in their full generalities. The two key ingredients lying in the background of our proof of Arnold's chord conjecture are the existence of the fundamental class of the Legendrian contact instanton cohomology modulo bubbling-off, and the evaluation transversality of the moduli space of contact instantons against the level set of conformal exponent function. Our proof of Weinstein's conjecture also utilizes the existence scheme of translated points of a contactomorphism developed in [Oh22a], especially associated to a contact Hamiltonian loop, via the geometric construction of the Legendrianization of contactomorphisms of $(Q,\lambda)$ in the contact product $M_Q = Q \times Q \times \mathbb R$ and its usage of the $\mathbb Z_2$ anti-contact involutive symmetry.</description>

      <title>An accurate approach to determining the spatiotemporal vehicle load on bridges based on measured boundary slopes</title>

Abstract: In this paper, a novel mathematical model is developed to evaluate the spatiotemporal vehicle loads on long bridges from slope measurements made at the ends of a bridge based on Euler-Bernoulli beam model with internal and external damping. The mathematical modelling of this phenomena leads to the inverse source problem of determining the spatiotemporal vehicle load $F(x,t)$ in the variable coefficient Euler-Bernoulli equation $\rho_A(x)u_{tt}+\mu(x) u_{t}+(r(x)u_{xx})_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{xx}=F(x,t)$, $(x,t)\in \Omega_T:=(0,\ell)\times (0,T)$ subject to the "simply supported" boundary conditions $u(0,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=0}=0$, $u(\ell,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=\ell}=0$, from the both measured outputs: $\theta_1(t):=u_x(0,t)$ and $\theta_2(t):=u_x(\ell,t)$, that is, the measured boundary slopes. It is shown that the input-output maps $(\Phi F)(t):=u_x(0,t;F)$, $(\Psi F)(t):=u_x(\ell,t;F)$, $F \in \mathcal{F}\subset L^2(\Omega_T)$, corresponding to the inverse problem, are compact and Lipschitz continuous. Then Tikhonov functional $J(F)=\Vert \Phi F-\theta_1 \Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2+\Vert \Psi F-\theta_2 \Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2$ is introduced to prove the existence of a quasi-solution to the inverse problem. An explicit gradient formula for the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the Tikhonov functional is derived. The Lipschitz continuity of the Fr\'{e}chet gradient, which guarantees the monotonicity of iterations in gradient methods, has been proven.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fairly general class of dynamical systems under the assumptions guaranteeing the existence of Lyapunov function around some nontrivial stationary point. Moreover, the existence of heteroclinic trajectory is proved motivated by integrated densities approach to some astrophysical models of self-gravitating particles both in relativistic and non--relativistic frameworks. Finally, with the aid of geometric and topological reasoning we find the upper bounds for this trajectory yielding the critical mass--radius theorem for the astrophysical model.</description>

Abstract: For rescaled additive functionals of the sine-process, upper bounds are obtained for their speed of convergence to the Gaussian distribution with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric. Under scaling with coefficient $R$ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is bounded from above by $c/\log R$ for a smooth function and by $c/R$ for a function holomorphic in a horizontal strip.</description>

      <title>The selection problem for a new class of perturbations of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a perturbation problem given by the equation: \begin{equation*} H(x, d_xu_\lambda, \lambda u_\lambda(x))+\lambda V(x,\lambda)=c \quad \text{in $M$}, \end{equation*} where $M$ is a closed manifold and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a perturbation parameter. The Hamiltonian $H(x,p,u):T^*M\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies certain convexity, superlinearity, and monotonicity conditions. $\lambda V(\cdot,\lambda):M\to\mathbb{R}$ converges to zero as $\lambda\to 0$. First, we study the asymptotic behavior of the viscosity solution $u_\lambda:M\to\mathbb{R}$ as $\lambda$ approaches zero. This perturbation problem explores the combined effects of both the vanishing discount process and potential perturbations, leading to a new selection principle that extends beyond the classical vanishing discount approach. Additionally, we apply this principle to Hamilton-Jacobi equations with $u$-independent Hamiltonians, resulting in the introduction of a new solution operator. This operator provides new insights into the variational characterization of viscosity solutions and Mather measures.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow structure for some nonlocal diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ``nonlocal diffusion equations'' of the form \[ \partial_{t}\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)+\int_{X}\left(\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)-\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(y)\right)\eta(x,y)d\pi(y)=0\qquad(\dagger) \] where $X$ is either $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{T}^{d}$, $\pi$ is a probability distribution on $X$, and $\eta(x,y)$ is a ``transition kernel'' which may be singular as $x\rightarrow y$. For a suitable notion of weak solutions which we discuss below, we show that solutions to these nonlocal diffusion equations can be interpreted as gradient flows of the relative entropy with respect to a certain nonlocal Wasserstein-type metric defined in terms of $\eta$ and $\pi$. These ``nonlocal Wasserstein metrics'' endow the space of probability measures on $X$ with a formal Riemannian structure, thereby providing for us a nonlocal analogue of the \emph{Otto calculus} originally developed in the context of the 2-Wasserstein metric. The class of equations $(\dagger)$ includes a family of ``nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations'', which are thus identified as nonlocal Wasserstein gradient flows of the relative entropy, analogously with the usual Fokker-Planck equation and the $W_{2}$ metric.
  The gradient flow structure we provide allows us to deduce: existence and uniqueness of solutions to ($\dagger$) in a suitable class of weak solutions; stability of solutions in the sense of evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence, with respect to perturbations of initial condition, reference measure $\pi$, and transition kernel $\eta$; sufficient conditions for exponential convergence to equilibrium, in terms of a nonlocal analogue of the log-Sobolev inequality; as well as the consistency of a finite-volume-type spatial discretization scheme in the $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove uniform ``pseudo-Siegel'' a priori bounds for Siegel disks of bounded type that give a uniform control of oscillations of their boundaries in all scales. As a consequence, we construct the Mother Hedgehog controlling the postcritical set for any quadratic polynomial with a neutral periodic point and show that this hedgehog has a star-like structure. Pseudo-Siegel bounds imply uniform a priori bounds of the Sector Renormalization, which gives an opportunity to extend Siegel/Pacman Renormalization Theory and Near-Parabolic Renormalization Theory to all near-neutral quadratic polynomials. Various applications beyond quadratic polynomials are also underway.</description>

      <title>Ground states and periodic orbits for expanding Thurston maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expanding Thurston maps form a class of branched covering maps on the topological $2$-sphere $S^{2}$, which are topological models of some non-uniformly expanding rational maps without any smoothness or holomorphicity assumption initially investigated by W. P. Thurston, M. Bonk, D. Meyer, P. Ha\"issinsky, and K. M. Pilgrim. The measures of maximal entropy and the absolutely continuous invariant measures for these maps have been studied by these authors, and equilibrium states by the first-named author. In this paper, we initiate the investigation on two new classes of invariant measures, namely, the maximizing measures and ground states, and establish the Liv\v{s}ic theorem, a local Anosov closing lemma, and give a positive answer to the Typically Periodic Optimization Conjecture from ergodic optimization for these maps. As an application, we establish these results for Misiurewicz--Thurston rational maps (i.e., postcritically-finite rational maps without periodic critical points) on the Riemann sphere including the Latt\`es maps with respect to the spherical metric. Our strategy relies on the visual metrics developed by the above authors.
  In particular, we verify, in a first non-uniformly expanding setting, the Typically Periodic Optimization Conjecture, establishing that for a generic H\"{o}lder continuous potential, there exists a unique maximizing measure, moreover, this measure is supported on a periodic orbit, it satisfies the locking property, and it is the unique ground state. The expanding Thurston maps we consider include those that are not topologically conjugate to rational maps; in particular, they can have periodic critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the geodesic flow on a geometrically finite locally symmetric space of negative curvature is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. The approach is based on constructing a suitable anisotropic Banach space on which the infinitesimal generator of the flow admits an essential spectral gap. A key step in the proof involves estimating certain oscillatory integrals against the Patterson-Sullivan measure. For this purpose, we prove a general result of independent interest asserting that the Fourier transform of measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that do not concentrate near proper affine hyperplanes enjoy polynomial decay outside of a sparse set of frequencies. As an intermediate step, we show that the $L^q$-dimension ($1&lt;q\leq \infty$) of iterated self-convolutions of such measures tend towards that of the ambient space. Our analysis also yields that the Laplace transform of the correlation function of smooth observables extends meromorphically to the entire complex plane in the convex cocompact case and to a strip of explicit size beyond the imaginary axis in the case the manifold admits cusps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a new mechanism that triggers periodic orbits in smooth dynamical systems. To this end, we introduce the concept of hybrid bifurcations: Such bifurcations occur when a line of equilibria with an exchange point of normal stability vanishes. Our main result is the existence and stability criteria of periodic orbits that bifurcate from breaking a line of equilibria. As an application, we obtain stable periodic coexistent solutions in an ecosystem for two competing predators with Holling's type II functional response.</description>

Abstract: In the second paper [LZ24b] of this series, we obtained an analog of the prime number theorem for a class of branched covering maps on the $2$-sphere $S^2$ called expanding Thurston maps, which are topological models of some non-uniformly expanding rational maps without any smoothness or holomorphicity assumption. More precisely, the number of primitive periodic orbits, ordered by a weight on each point induced by a non-constant (eventually) positive real-valued H\"{o}lder continuous function on $S^2$ satisfying the $\alpha$-strong non-integrability condition, is asymptotically the same as the well-known logarithmic integral, with an exponential error bound. In this third and last paper of the series, we show that the $\alpha$-strong non-integrability condition is generic in the class of $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions.</description>

Abstract: Expanding Thurston maps were introduced by M. Bonk and D. Meyer with motivation from complex dynamics and Cannon's conjecture from geometric group theory via Sullivan's dictionary. In this paper, we introduce subsystems of expanding Thurston maps motivated via Sullivan's dictionary as analogs of some subgroups of Kleinian groups. We use thermodynamic formalism to prove the Variational Principle and the existence of equilibrium states for strongly irreducible subsystems and real-valued H\"older continuous potentials. Here, the sphere $S^{2}$ is equipped with a natural metric, called a visual metric, introduced by M. Bonk and D. Meyer. As an application, we establish large deviation asymptotics for expanding Thurston maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homotopic-to-the-identity torus homeomorphisms, whose rotation set has nonempty interior. We prove that any such map is monotonically semiconjugate to a homeomorphism that preserves the Lebesgue measure, and that has the same rotation set. Furthermore, the dynamics of the quotient map has several interesting chaotic traits: for instance, it is topologically mixing, has a dense set of periodic points and is continuum-wise expansive. In particular, this shows that a convex compact set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with nonempty interior is the rotation set of the lift of a homeomorphism of $\mathbb{T}^2$ if and only if it is the rotation set of the lift of a conservative homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>A generation theorem for the perturbation of strongly continuous semigroups by unbounded operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness of the evolution equation of the form $u'(t)=Au(t)+Cu(t)$, $t\ge 0$, where $A$ is the generator of a $C_0$- semigroup and $C$ is a (possibly unbounded) linear operator in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$. We prove that if $A$ generates a $C_0$-semigroup $\left (T_A(t)\right )_{t \geq 0}$ with $\|T(t)\| \le Me^{\omega t}$ in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ and $C$ is a linear operator in $\mathbb{X}$ such that $D(A)\subset D(C)$ and $\| CR(\mu ,A)\| \le K/(\mu -\omega)$ for each $\mu&gt;\omega$, then, the above-mentioned evolution equation is well-posed, that is, $A+C$ generates a $C_0$-semigroup $\left (T_{A+C}(t)\right )_{t \geq 0}$ satisfying $\| T_{A+C}(t)\| \le Me^{(\omega +MK)t}$. Our approach is to use the Hille-Yosida Theorem. Discussions on the persistence of asymptotic behavior of the perturbed equations such as the roughness of exponential dichotomy are also given. The obtained results seem to be new.</description>

Abstract: While linear systems are well-understood, no explicit solution for general nonlinear systems exists. A classical approach to make the understanding of linear system available in the nonlinear setting is to represent a nonlinear system by a linear model. While progress has been made in extending linearization techniques to larger domains and more complex attractor geometries, recent work has highlighted the limitations of these techniques when applied to nonlinear dynamics, such as those with coexisting attractors. In this work, we show nonlinear dynamics with a continuous Koopman spectrum, a limit cycle, and coexisting solutions that can be globally linearized. To this end, we explicitly construct linear systems mimicking these nonlinear behaviors. Subsequently, we approximate transformations between linear and nonlinear systems with deep neural networks. This approach yields finite dimensional linearizations exceeding the phase space dimension of the underlying linear system by one at most.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic functions whose action on their Julia sets is Non-Ergodic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nevanlinna functions are meromorphic functions with a finite number of asymptotic values and no critical values. In [KK2] it was proved that if the orbits of all the asymptotic values accumulate on a compact set on which the function acts as a repeller, then the function acts ergodically on its Julia set. In [CJK4] we proved the action of the function on its Julia set is still ergodic if some, but not all of the asymptotic values land on infinity, and the remaining ones land on a compact repeller. In this paper, we complete the characterization of ergodicity for Nevanlinna functions by proving that if all the asymptotic values land on infinity, then the Julia set is the whole sphere and the action of the map there is non-ergodic.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Measurement of Cyber Resilience: Modeling and Experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber resilience is the ability of a system to resist and recover from a cyber attack, thereby restoring the system's functionality. Effective design and development of a cyber resilient system requires experimental methods and tools for quantitative measuring of cyber resilience. This paper describes an experimental method and test bed for obtaining resilience-relevant data as a system (in our case -- a truck) traverses its route, in repeatable, systematic experiments. We model a truck equipped with an autonomous cyber-defense system and which also includes inherent physical resilience features. When attacked by malware, this ensemble of cyber-physical features (i.e., "bonware") strives to resist and recover from the performance degradation caused by the malware's attack. We propose parsimonious mathematical models to aid in quantifying systems' resilience to cyber attacks. Using the models, we identify quantitative characteristics obtainable from experimental data, and show that these characteristics can serve as useful quantitative measures of cyber resilience.</description>

      <title>Potential detrimental effects of real-time route recommendations in traffic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation apps have become pervasive in providing real-time route recommendations to travelers willing to minimize their travel times. However, such technologies introduce new complexities, raising concerns about their overall impact on traffic networks. This paper focuses on evaluating the effect of navigation apps on traffic flows, particularly examining how real-time route recommendations influence network efficiency and congestion. Using a dynamical network flow model, we study traffic dynamics between an origin-destination pair, where a fraction of drivers follow app recommendations while others rely on fixed route preferences. By incorporating supply-demand mechanisms to account for capacity and volume constraints on routes, we uncover partial demand transfer, i.e., only a portion of the traffic demand is able to traverse the network, while the rest builds up congestion at the origin. We prove that the dynamics converges to a globally stable equilibrium and we provide a detailed analysis of this equilibrium when the choices of the informed drivers follow a logit model, correlating the emergence of partial demand transfer to the penetration rate of navigation apps among users.</description>

      <title>Epidemic Population Games And Perturbed Best Response Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to mitigate epidemic spread in a population of strategic agents by encouraging safer behaviors through carefully designed rewards. These rewards, which adapt to the evolving state of the epidemic, are ascribed by a dynamic payoff mechanism we seek to design. We use a modified SIRS model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the agents' strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics to model the population's strategic behavior, we extend previous related work so as to allow for noise in the agents' perceptions of the rewards and intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic's spread rate is influenced by the time scale of the payoff mechanism's dynamics. Additionally, we derive anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing us to quantify the trade-off between peak infection prevalence and the corresponding cost. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response models, we propose a method to learn the model's parameter from data.</description>

      <title>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. We also demonstrate that this effective asymmetry generated by the rapid yawing can cause chaotic behaviour in the emergent dynamics, in stark contrast to the emergent dynamics generated by rapidly rotating spheroids, which are equivalent to those of effective passive spheroids. In general, we find that the shape of the equivalent effective particle under rapid yawing is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. In these scenarios, we calculate analytically the equivalent aspect ratio of the effective spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for locally monotone stochastic evolution equations with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>
