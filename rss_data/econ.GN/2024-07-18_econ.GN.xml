      <title>Market Definition: A Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market definition holds significant importance in antitrust cases, yet achieving consensus on the correct approach remains elusive. As a result, analysts routinely entertain multiple market definitions to ensure the resilience of their conclusions. I propose a simple framework for conducting organized sensitivity analysis with respect to market definition. I model candidate market definitions as partially ordered and use a Hasse diagram, a directed acyclic graph representing a finite partial order, to summarize the sensitivity analysis. I use the Shapley value and the Shapley-Shubik power index to quantify the average marginal contribution of each firm in driving the conclusion. I illustrate the method's usefulness with an application to the Albertsons/Safeway (2015) merger.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Potential Impact of Combined Race and Ethnicity Reporting on Long-Term Earnings Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use place of birth information from the Social Security Administration linked to earnings data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program and detailed race and ethnicity data from the 2010 Census to study how long-term earnings differentials vary by place of birth for different self-identified race and ethnicity categories. We focus on foreign-born persons from countries that are heavily Hispanic and from countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We find substantial heterogeneity of long-term earnings differentials within country of birth, some of which will be difficult to detect when the reporting format changes from the current two-question version to the new single-question version because they depend on self-identifications that place the individual in two distinct categories within the single-question format, specifically, Hispanic and White or Black, and MENA and White or Black. We also study the USA-born children of these same immigrants. Long-term earnings differences for the 2nd generation also vary as a function of self-identified ethnicity and race in ways that changing to the single-question format could affect.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Behavioral Economics: Internal Validity and Elicitation of Mental Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the transformative potential of integrating generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), into behavioral and experimental economics to enhance internal validity. By leveraging AI tools, researchers can improve adherence to key exclusion restrictions and in particular ensure the internal validity measures of mental models, which often require human intervention in the incentive mechanism. We present a case study demonstrating how LLMs can enhance experimental design, participant engagement, and the validity of measuring mental models.</description>

      <title>Information Flow in the FTX Bankruptcy: A Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the cryptocurrency network of the FTX exchange during the collapse of its native token, FTT, to understand how network structures adapt to significant financial disruptions, by exploiting vertex centrality measures. Using proprietary data on the transactional relationships between various cryptocurrencies, we construct the filtered correlation matrix to identify the most significant relations in the FTX and Binance markets. By using suitable centrality measures - closeness and information centrality - we assess network stability during FTX's bankruptcy. The findings document the appropriateness of such vertex centralities in understanding the resilience and vulnerabilities of financial networks. By tracking the changes in centrality values before and during the FTX crisis, this study provides useful insights into the structural dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Results reveal how different cryptocurrencies experienced shifts in their network roles due to the crisis. Moreover, our findings highlight the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency markets and how the failure of a single entity can lead to widespread repercussions that destabilize other nodes of the network.</description>

      <title>Startup Acquisitions: Acquihires and Talent Hoarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how competitive forces may drive firms to inefficiently acquire startup talent. In our model, two rival firms have the capacity to acquire and integrate a startup operating in an orthogonal market. We show that firms may pursue such acquihires primarily as a preemptive strategy, even when they appear unprofitable in isolation. Thus, acquihires, even absent traditional competition-reducing effects, need not be benign, as they can lead to inefficient talent allocation. Additionally, our analysis underscores that such talent hoarding can diminish consumer surplus and exacerbate job volatility for acquihired employees.</description>

      <title>Bundling Demand in K-12 Broadband Procurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the effects of bundling demand for broadband internet by K-12 schools. In 2014, New Jersey switched from decentralized procurements to a new procurement system that bundled schools into four regional groups. Using an event study approach, we find that, on average, prices for participants decreased by one-third, and the broadband speed purchased increased sixfold. Bounding the change in school expenditures due to the program, we find that participants saved at least as much as their total E-rate subsidy from the federal government. Furthermore, under the assumption of log-concave demand, we show that participating schools experienced large welfare gains.</description>

      <title>Fight like a Woman: Domestic Violence and Female Judges in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of judges' gender on the outcome of domestic violence cases. Using data from S\~ao Paulo, Brazil, between 2010 and 2019, we compare conviction rates by judge's gender and find that a domestic violence case assigned to a female judge is 31\% (10 p.p.) more likely to result in conviction than a case assigned to a male judge with similar career characteristics. To show that this decision gap rises due to different gender perspectives about domestic violence and not because female judges are stricter than their male counterparts in all rulings, we compare it against the gender conviction-rate gap in similar types of crime. We find that the gender conviction-rate gap for domestic violence cases is significantly larger than the same gap for other misdemeanor cases (3 p.p. larger) and for other physical assault cases (8 p.p. larger). Furthermore, we find evidence that at least two channels explain this gender conviction-rate gap for domestic violence cases: gender-based differences in evidence interpretation and gender-based sentencing criteria. Lastly, we find that this gender conviction rate has no significant impact on the probability of appeals, ruling reversals or recidivism.</description>
