      <title>X-ray induced quenching of the 229Th clock isomer in CaF2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thorium-229 has the lowest nuclear-excited state (an isomer state) at approximately 8.356 eV, making it excitable with tabletop vacuum-ultraviolet lasers. Despite the recent success of laser excitation, the isomer quenching inside the solid-state environment remains unresolved. In this letter, we present experiments investigating X-ray-induced isomer quenching in the CaF$_2$ host, focusing on the effects of X-ray flux and temperature on the lifetime and yield of the isomer state. Our studies reveal a correlation between isomer production, isomer lifetime during irradiation, and post-irradiation afterglow of the target crystal across different temperatures, highlighting a strong relationship between isomer quenching and color-center dynamics. We developed a model to interpret the isomer quenching and the crystal's luminescence.</description>

      <title>Directional Thermal Emission Across Both Polarizations in Planar Photonic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional and spectral control of thermal emission is essential for applications in energy conversion, imaging, and sensing. Existing planar, lithography-free epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) films only support transverse-magnetic (TM) control of thermal emission via the Berreman mode and cannot address transverse-electric (TE) waves due to the absence of natural optical magnetism over optical and infrared wavelengths Here, we introduce a hyperbolic metamaterial comprising alternating layers of degenerately-doped and intrinsic InAs that exhibits an epsilon-and-mu-near-zero (EMNZ) response, enabling dual-polarized, directionally and spectrally selective thermal emission. We first theoretically demonstrate that a mu-near-zero (MNZ) film on a perfect magnetic conductor supports a magnetic Berreman mode, absorbing TE-polarized radiation in analogy to the conventional Berreman mode supported in TM polarization. Using genetic and gradient-descent optimization, we design a dual-polarized emitter with independently tunable spectral peaks and emission angles. Parameter retrieval via homogenization confirms simultaneous EMNZ points at the target wavelengths and angles. Finally, experimental measurement of a sample fabricated via molecular beam epitaxy exhibits high absorptivity peaks for both polarizations in close agreement with simulations. This work realizes lithography-free, dual-polarized, spectrally and directionally selective emitters, offering a versatile platform for advanced infrared thermal management and device integration.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of phonon polaritons and long wavelength dielectric response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles approach for calculating phonon-polariton dispersion relations. In this approach, phonon-photon interaction is described by quantization of a Hamiltonian that describes harmonic lattice vibrations coupled with the electromagnetic field inside the material. All Hamiltonian parameters are obtained from first-principles calculations, with diagonalization leading to non-interacting polariton quasiparticles. This method naturally includes retardation effects and resolves non-analytical behavior and ambiguities in phonon frequencies at the Brillouin zone center, especially in non-cubic and optically anisotropic materials. Furthermore, by incorporating higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian, we also account for quasiparticle interactions and spectral broadening. Specifically, we show how anharmonic effects in phonon polaritons lead to a dielectric response that challenges traditional models. The accuracy and consequences of the approach are demonstrated on GaP and GaN as harmonic test systems and PbTe and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as anharmonic test systems.</description>

Abstract: The study of silver or copper center creation in quartz crystals by thermal annealing at 1200C in oxygen atmosphere from metallic silver and gold. Previously, the effect of treatment in oxygen atmosphere at high temperatures on copper luminescence centers in quartz was discovered. In this work, we investigated the effect of such treatment on silver centers in quartz, studied previously. Also, a series of non-activated crystalline quartz samples were thermally annealed at 1200C in an oxygen atmosphere together with metallic silver. An attempt was made to introduce gold into quartz by such treatment in oxygen. Both high-purity gold and containing parasitic impurities of silver and copper were used. In the latter case, we obtained silver and copper luminescence centers but were unable to identify the luminescence of centers associated with Au.</description>

      <title>Observation of Order and Disorder in Solid-Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium-Metal Anodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery interfaces critically influence lithium-metal battery performance through their role in ion diffusion and dendrite formation. However, structural characterization of these interfaces has remained challenging due to limitations in high-resolution methods and artifacts from electron irradiation. Using cryogenic conditions for both specimen preparation and scanning electron nanobeam diffraction, we can determine the structural organization at the interface between the vitrified electrolyte and adjacent layers. We identified two distinct interface types: one showing short-range order adjacent to lithium metal, and another displaying a mixed structure of short-range ordering and defective lithium fluoride nanoscale crystallites at a copper collector. Notably, short-range order appeared exclusively in electrolytes demonstrating high reversibility. Our results establish that solid-electrolyte-interphase structure directly influences lithium deposition morphology and battery performance. This methodology opens new possibilities for high-resolution characterization of interfaces in energy storage materials, advancing our understanding of their critical structural properties.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Mixed Quantum-Classical Approach for Many-Body Quantum Dynamics of Exciton-Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use a mixed quantum-classical (mean-field) many-body approach for simulating the quantum dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons beyond the single-excitation subspace. We combine the multitrajectory Ehrenfest approach, which propagates slow degrees of freedom classically, with the Gross-Pitaevskii method, which propagates fast degrees of freedom in a mean-field fashion. We use this mean-field many-body Ehrenfest approach to analyze how the phonon-induced dynamic disorder and the many-body interaction affect the incoherent and coherent dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons. We examine how the number of excitations and the strength of repulsive exciton-exciton interaction nonlinearly influence the transport, Fr\"ohlich scattering and decoherence.</description>

      <title>Regional chemical potential analysis for material surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a local regional chemical potential (RCP) analysis method based on an energy window scheme to quantitatively estimate the selectivity of atomic and molecular adsorption on surfaces, as well as the strength of chemical bonding forces between a probe tip and a surface in atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. In particular, focusing on the local picture of covalent bonding, we use a simple H2 molecular model to demonstrate a clear relationship between chemical bonding forces and the local RCP. Moreover, density functional theory calculations on molecular systems and diamond C(001) surfaces reveal that the local RCP at the surfaces successfully visualizes electron-donating regions such as dangling bonds and double bonds. These results suggest that the local RCP can serve as an effective measure to analyze high-resolution non-contact or near-contact AFM images enhanced by chemical bonding forces.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of nitrogen doped diamond: A first principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic and electrical properties of nitrogen doped diamond system have been studied within the framework of a density functional theoretical approach. Spin-polarised calculations reveal that only the nitrogen doped system with adjacent carbon vacancies (NV-centre) leads to stable magnetism in N-doped diamond. The magnitude of the induced magnetic moment increases linearly with increasing number of NV centres in the system. This result explains earlier experimental reports suggesting unconventional magnetism in N-doped pristine diamond. The 2p-orbital electrons of the three carbon atoms adjacent to the vacancy contribute to the magnetic moment in the system. Notably, lone N at the lattice site in diamond system fails to induce any significant moment, whearas the C-vacancy and N-interstitial positions induce magnetic moment in the diamond system. Moreover, the NV-center system has p-type semiconducting characteristics, making it a potential candidate for spintronics applications. To quantify the feasibility of different systems, the magnetic moment, ground state free energy, Fermi energy and defect formation energy were calculated for each structure.</description>

      <title>Differentiation of Distinct Single Atoms via Multi-Defocus Fusion Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04078v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) is a vital tool for characterizing single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, reliable elemental identification of different atoms remains challenging because the signal intensity of HAADF depends strongly on defocus and other imaging parameters, potentially ruining the Z-contrast of atoms at different depths. In this work, we investigated the influence of the vertical position of atoms (defocus), support thickness, interatomic height, convergence and collection angles via multi-slice simulations on a model system of Fe/Pt atoms on amorphous carbon supports. Our calculation shows that at a convergence angle of 28 mrad, a defocus of 4.6 nm can cause Fe and Pt atoms indistinguishable. At a larger convergence angle, this critical indistinguishable defocus can be even shorter. To address this limitation, we propose a Multi-Defocus Fusion (MDF) method, retrieving the Z-contrast from serial images from multiple defocus. Experimental validation on a Fe/Pt SAC sample confirms the effectiveness of MDF, yielding clearly separated intensity histograms corresponding to Fe and Pt atoms. This work presents a robust, easy-to-implement strategy for accurate single-atom identification, offering valuable guidance for the accelerated screening and rational design of high-performance SACs.</description>

      <title>Direct Bandgap Photoluminescence of GeSn grown on Si(100) substrate by Molecular Beam Epitaxy Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group IV alloys of GeSn have gained significant attention for electronic and optoelectronic applications on a Si platform due to their compatibility with existing CMOS technology, tunable band structure, and potential for a direct bandgap at high Sn concentrations. However, synthesizing Sn-rich GeSn structures remains challenging due to the low solid solubility of Sn in Ge (less than 1%) and the substantial lattice mismatch ( about 14%) between Sn and Ge. In this work, we demonstrate the successful growth of high-quality, relaxed GeSn layers with Sn contents of 9.2% and 11.4% on Si(100) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). As far as we know, this is the first report of direct bandgap photoluminescence observed from MBE-grown GeSn films without post-growth annealing. Structural characterizations including X-ray diffraction (XRD), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirm uniform Sn incorporation with minimal defect formation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals smooth surfaces with low roughness. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements further confirm direct bandgap emission, representing a new stage in the development of MBE-grown GeSn.</description>

      <title>A Mesoscale Model for Interface-Mediated Plasticity: Investigation of Ductile and Brittle Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of interfaces and grain boundaries significantly impacts the mechanical properties of materials, particularly when dealing with micro- or nano-scale samples. Distinct interactions between dislocations and grain boundaries can lead to entirely different overall plastic deformation characteristics. This paper employs a two-dimensional continuum dislocation dynamics model to investigate the mechanical properties of materials. To accurately depict the physical interactions between lattice dislocations and interfaces/grain boundaries, we apply a mesoscale interface boundary condition, considering various numerical cases, such as single and multiple slip systems. Apart from affecting strength and ductility, the accumulation of dislocations near the interface can induce local high stress, potentially resulting in brittle fracture near the interface. Consequently, materials experience a competition between ductile and brittle fracture modes during the loading process. A phenomenon known as the strain hardening rate up-turn is also investigated under different reaction constants, which can be explained by the competition between the rates of dislocation accumulation and reaction at the interface.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Theory of Electrochemical Ostwald Ripening for Electrodeposited Lithium Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of lithium nuclei under the competing effects of electroplating and surface energy-driven redistribution (electrochemical Ostwald ripening). Our model introduces a formulation that accounts for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resistance, electrolyte conductivity, and electrode wettability, capturing the transition from SEI to electrolyte-limited growth regimes. We identify asymptotic behaviors for high and low current densities, quantify the conditions under which ripening dominates, and derive analytical expressions for nucleus size, density, and surface coverage. Model predictions show excellent agreement with experimental data across multiple datasets. The results reveal how SEI and electrolyte conductivity, current density and metal-electrode contact angle govern deposition morphology and Coulombic efficiency. Based on these insights, we outline experimentally accessible guidelines to improve battery efficiency and cycling stability - offering a simple yet predictive approach for optimizing metal electrodeposition processes in battery systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>Defect engineering and effect of vacancy concentration on the electrochemical performance of V-based MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacancies play a pivotal role in determining the physical and chemical properties of materials. Introducing vacancies into two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a promising strategy for developing high-performance electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. Herein, a facile top-down strategy is employed to create V-based MXenes with tunable vacancy concentrations, achieved by designing the precursor (V1-xCrx)2AlC (x=0.05, 0.1, 0.3) MAX phase and precisely controlling the etching process. Systematic investigations reveal that introducing a moderate concentration of Cr-induced vacancies significantly enhances both the capacitance and rate performance of V-based MXenes. Specifically, V1.9CTz achieves a capacitance of 760 F g-1, far exceeding the 420 F g-1 of vacancy-free V2CTz MXene. In contrast, an excessively high vacancy concentration lead to deteriorated electrochemical performance and compromised structural stability. This work illustrates that defect engineering is a powerful approach to tailor the electrochemical properties of MXenes, offering a framework for designing next-generation MXene-based energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>FRET-Enhanced Singlet Fission in Pentacene Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversion of solar energy with high quantum efficiencies is a key challenge in energy technologies. Excitation energy transfer (EET) mechanisms, such as F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET), play a crucial role in facilitating minimal energy loss in biological light-harvesting systems by directing excitation energy to conversion centers. Inspired by this, we show that singlet fission (SF) sensitizers are multi-exciton generation centers, to which surrounding molecules funnel excitation energy via FRET. We study the impact of such EET on SF using two structurally distinct yet optically similar pentacene derivatives: a stability-enhanced ''Gel\"ander'' pentacene, and the well-studied TIPS-pentacene. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals a $R^{6}$ dependence of the SF rate on molecular separation $R$ in binary acene:polymethylmetacrylate thin film blends, which is typical for FRET. Optimizing FRET is a promising direction for future improvements in light harvesting using SF materials, inspired by natural light-harvesting complexes.</description>

      <title>Rotation-Induced Orbital Currents in Ferro-Rotational Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of orbital angular momentum has become important to effectuate new ways to address switchable magnetic devices. Here, we demonstrate the electrical generation of unconventional orbital currents in ferro-rotational systems through an intrinsic, nonrelativistic mechanism associated with an electric hexadecapole moment. These rotation-induced orbital currents are examined using tight-binding models, and we also provide first-principles calculations for the ferro-rotational material TiAu$_4$. Our findings unveil a novel pathway for generating orbital currents beyond the conventional orbital Hall effect, broadening the landscape of orbitronics research to include novel ferroic materials and higher-order electric multipoles.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Solid-State Sodium-Based Batteries: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript explores recent advancements in solid-state sodium-based battery technology, particularly focusing on electrochemical performance and the challenges associated with developing efficient solid electrolytes. The replacement of conventional liquid electrolytes with solid-state alternatives offers numerous benefits, including enhanced safety and environmental sustainability, as solid-state systems reduce flammability and harsh chemical handling. The work emphasizes the importance of structure and interface characteristics in solid electrolytes, which play a critical role in ionic conductivity and overall battery performance. Various classes of solid electrolytes, such as sodium-based anti-perovskites and sulphide electrolytes, are examined, highlighting their unique ionic transport mechanisms and mechanical properties that facilitate stable cycling. The manuscript also discusses strategies to enhance interfacial stability between the anode and the solid electrolyte to mitigate performance degradation during battery operation. Furthermore, advancements in electrode formulations and the integration of novel materials are considered pivotal in optimizing the charging and discharging processes, thus improving the energy and power densities of sodium batteries. The outlook on the future of sodium-based solid-state batteries underscores their potential to meet emerging energy storage demands while leveraging the abundant availability of sodium compared to lithium. This comprehensive review aims to provide insights into ongoing research and prospective directions for the commercialization of solid-state sodium-based batteries, positioning them as viable alternatives in the renewable energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Conduction Band Structure and Ultrafast Dynamics of Ferroelectric $\alpha$-GeTe(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-GeTe(111) is a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric (FE) material for which a significative lattice distortion combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction gives rise to giant Rashba split states in the bulk and at the surface, which have been intensively probed in the occupied valence states using static angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Nevertheless, its unoccupied conduction band structure remains unexplored, in particular the experimental determination of its electronic band gap across momentum space. Using time-resolved ARPES based on high-repetition rate and extreme ultraviolet femtosecond (fs) laser, we unveil the band structure of $\alpha$-GeTe(111) in the full Brillouin zone, both in the valence and conduction states, as well as the exploration of its out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Our work confirms the semiconducting nature of $\alpha$-GeTe(111) with a 0.85 eV indirect band gap, which provides an upper limit for comparison to density functional theory calculations. We finally reveal the dominant scattering mechanisms of photoexcited carriers during the out-of-equilibrium dynamics under fs light pulses.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the structure of epitaxial Si3N4 on AlGaN/GaN via evolutionary structure search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium nitride (GaN)-based devices, such as high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), benefit from the integration of a silicon nitride (Si3N4) cap layer on the AlGaN barrier. Previous studies, relying on empirical methods and the lack of systematic structure-searching tools, suggested a defect-wurtzite (DW-Si3N4) structure for Si3N4 on AlGaN. However, this structure, while plausible, is energetically much higher compared to beta-Si3N4. In a recent experiment (Appl. Phys. Lett. 125, 122109 (2024)), we synthesized a 2 nm thick crystalline Si3N4 layer on AlGaN. This finding prompted a reexamination of its atomic configuration, given the discrepancies between the previously proposed defect-wurtzite (DW) phase and experimental observations. To address this, we employed a systematic structure search to identify a more stable configuration, which we denote as Lam-Si3N4. This structure, characterized by a quasi-two-dimensional (Lamina) structure, is approximately 60 meV/atom lower in energy than the DW-Si3N4 structure under the in-plane lattice constant constraint matching AlGaN, and provides a better match to experimental data. Furthermore, when fully relaxed (i.e., no external strain), both DW-Si3N4 and Lam-Si3N4 exhibit wide band gaps around 4~eV. However, under the imposed AlGaN lattice constant constraint, the band gap of DW-Si3N4 significantly shrinks, whereas Lam-Si3N4 retains a relatively larger gap. The mechanical and phonon anisotropy in Lam-Si3N4 may lead to distinct directional thermal conductivity and elastic behavior, which can be beneficial for high-frequency and high-power applications. These findings provide important insights into the structure and properties of in situ grown Si3N4, potentially guiding further optimization of cap layers for GaN-based devices.</description>

      <title>TBA-enabled spin-coating of a percolatively connected GO nanosieve for thru-hole epitaxy: tuning GO flake stacking and coverage to control GaN nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a spin-coating-based approach for forming a percolatively connected graphene oxide (GO) nanosieve on SiO$_2$-patterned sapphire substrates, where the addition of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) to the GO solution significantly improves the uniformity of flake coverage and modulates GaN nucleation behavior. Upon thermal annealing of GO, the resulting reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films exhibit spatially varying coverage, leading to three distinct GaN nucleation outcomes: (i) ELOG-like nucleation on exposed substrate regions, (ii) thru-hole epitaxy (THE)-like nucleation through appropriately thin areas, and (iii) complete nucleation suppression on thickly stacked zones. On spin-coated GO films without TBA, all three behaviors coexist, and undesired ELOG- and no-nucleation modes persist due to uneven coverage. Importantly, these issues cannot be resolved by simply adjusting GO flake concentration, as concentration tuning alone fails to eliminate the formation of locally bare and overly thick regions. In contrast, the addition of TBA results in a more uniform, moderately stacked rGO morphology that suppresses both ELOG- and no-nucleation modes while expanding THE-like nucleation regions. This reshaped nucleation landscape confines GaN growth to areas with engineered percolative transport. The approach offers a scalable, lithography-free route for controlling GaN epitaxy using solution-processable 2D material masks.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Room Temperature Exchange Bias through N\'eel Order Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange bias effect plays a crucial role in modern magnetic memory technology. Recently, van der Waals magnetic materials have emerged and shown potential in spintronic devices at atomic scale. Owing to their tunable physical properties and the flexibility in fabrication, the van der Waals heterostructures offer more possibilities for investigating potential mechanisms of the exchange bias effect. However, due to low magnetic ordering temperatures for most van der Waals magnets, to establish exchange bias in van der Waals antiferromagnet/ferromagnet heterostructures at room temperature is challenging. In this study, we fabricate (Fe$_{0.56}$Co$_{0.44}$)$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$(FCGT)/Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$(FGaT) heterostructures with magnetic ordering temperatures of each component well above room temperature to achieve a room temperature exchange bias effect. It is found that the sign and magnitude of the exchange bias field can be efficiently controlled by manipulating the N\'eel order of FCGT with magnetic field. The manipulation of N\'eel order shows significant magnetic field dependence. A strong pre-set field induces a switch in the N\'eel order of FCGT, which aligns the interfacial magnetization at the FCGT/FGaT interface, leading to robust exchange bias, as revealed by both transport measurements and macro-spin model calculations. Our findings demonstrate the intrinsic manipulation and switchable of room-temperature exchange bias in all-van der Waals heterostructures and further promote the development of novel two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature transport in high-conductivity correlated metals: a density-functional plus dynamical mean-field study of cubic perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While methods based on density-functional perturbation theory have dramatically improved our understanding of electron-phonon contributions to transport in materials, methods for accurately capturing electron-electron scattering relevant to low temperatures have seen significantly less development. The case of high-conductivity, moderately correlated materials characterized by low scattering rates is particularly challenging, since exquisite numerical precision of the low-energy electronic structure is required. Recent methodological advancements to density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), including adaptive Brillouin-zone integration and numerically precise self-energies, enable a rigorous investigation of electron-electron scattering in such materials. In particular, these tools may be leveraged to perform a robust scattering-rate analysis on both real- and imaginary-frequency axes. Applying this methodology to a subset of ABO$_3$ perovskite oxides -- SrVO$_3$, SrMoO$_3$, PbMoO$_3$, and SrRuO$_3$ -- we demonstrate its ability to qualitatively and quantitatively describe electron-electron contributions to the temperature-dependent direct-current resistivity. This combination of numerical techniques offers fundamental insight into the role of electronic correlations in transport phenomena and provides a predictive tool for identifying materials with potential for technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling multimetallic systems efficiently enables faster prediction of desirable chemical properties and design of new materials. This work describes an initial implementation for performing multireference wave function method localized active space self-consistent field (LASSCF) calculations through the use of multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate time-to-solution. Density fitting is leveraged to reduce memory requirements, and we demonstrate the ability to fully utilize multi-GPU compute nodes. Performance improvements of 5-10x in total application runtime were observed in LASSCF calculations for multimetallic catalyst systems up to 1200 AOs and an active space of (22e,40o) using up to four NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Written with performance portability in mind, comparable performance is also observed in early runs on the Aurora exascale system using Intel Max Series GPUs.</description>

      <title>Geometry dependence of the thermal Hall effect in chiral spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent thermal-transport experiments on the Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ highlight the challenge in identifying chiral quantum spin liquids through their quantized thermal Hall effect. Here, we propose that variations in the underlying sample geometry -- for example, the introduction of appropriate constrictions -- reveal unique aspects of the thermal Hall effect and can be used to determine its origin. By studying standard phenomenological heat-transport equations based on minimal assumptions, we show that, whereas a conventional thermal Hall effect due to, e.g., phonons or magnons is completely geometry independent, a thermal Hall effect originating from a chiral fermion edge mode is significantly enhanced by constrictions at low temperatures. This unique geometry-dependent signature provides a practical approach for identifying chiral spin liquids in candidate materials like $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ using currently available thermal-transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic evidence of intra-unit-cell charge redistribution in charge-neutral magnetic topological insulator Sb-doped MnBi6Te10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_{6}$Te$_{10}$ has emerged as a promising candidate for realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), owing to its ability to retain ferromagnetism through precise control of anti-site defects. The next important task for realizing the QAHE is to tune the chemical potential into the energy gap formed by the broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we reveal an intra-unit-cell charge redistribution even when the overall doping suggests a near-charge-neutral condition. By performing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) on the optimally 18% Sb-doped MnBi$_{6}$Te$_{10}$, we observe transient surface photovoltage (SPV) effects on both the MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and single-Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ terminations. Furthermore, we observe a time-dependent splitting of the band structure indicating multiple SPV shifts with different magnitudes. This observation suggests that adjacent plateaus with nominally the same terminating layer exhibit a strong intra-unit-cell charge redistribution, resulting in spontaneous electrical polarization. This is consistent with static micro-ARPES measurements revealing significant doping deviations from the charge-neutral configuration. Our findings underscore the challenges of engineering the family of Mn-Bi-Te materials to realize QAHE purely through chemical doping. Achieving the desired topological quantum phase requires both a uniform carrier doping and a ferromagnetic ground state. Furthermore, the light-induced polarization within each unit cell of ferromagnetic Mn(Bi$_{0.82}$Sb$_{0.18}$)$_{6}$Te$_{10}$ may open new possibilities for optoelectronic and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Coupling in Correlated Metals: A Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong electron-electron interactions are known to significantly modify the electron-phonon coupling relative to the predictions of density functional theory, but this effect is challenging to calculate with realistic theories of strongly correlated materials. Here we define and calculate a version of the EPC applicable beyond band theory by combining first principles density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory with finite difference phonon perturbations, presenting results for several representative phonon modes in two materials of interest. In the three-orbital correlated metal SrVO$_3$, we find that intra-V-$t_{2g}$ band correlation significantly increases the coupling of these electrons to a Jahn-Teller phonon mode that splits the degenerate orbital energies, while slightly reducing the coupling associated with a breathing phonon that couples to the charge on each V atom. In the infinite layer cuprate CaCuO$_2$, we find that local correlation within the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital derived band has a modest effect on coupling of near-Fermi surface electrons to optical breathing modes. In both cases, the interaction correction to the electron-phonon coupling predicted by dynamical mean-field theory has a significant dependence on the electronic frequency, arising from a lattice-distortion dependence of the correlated electron dynamics, showing the inadequacy of the simple picture in which correlations change static local susceptibilities. We also show that the electron-phonon scattering and phonon lifetimes associated with these phonon modes are modified by the electronic correlation. Our findings shed light on the material- and mode-specific role of dynamical electronic correlation in electron-phonon coupling and highlight the importance of developing efficient computational methods for treating electron-phonon coupling in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Large-scale exponential correlations of non-affine elastic response of strongly disordered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation properties of non-affine elastic response in strongly disordered materials are investigated using the theory of correlated random matrices and molecular dynamics simulations. The random matrix theory shows that the divergence of the non-affine displacement field has large-scale exponentially decaying correlations. The corresponding length scale $\xi$ is determined by the strength of the disorder and can be indefinitely large, significantly exceeding the correlation length of the disorder. The rotor of the non-affine displacement field has the same length scale $\xi$ except the case of the volumetric deformation. The main theoretical dependencies are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation of a model polystyrene in the amorphous state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.14634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergence of topological states in strongly correlated systems, particularly two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides, offers a platform for manipulating electronic properties in quantum materials. However, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between correlations and topology remains elusive. Here we employ first-principles modeling to reveal two distinct 2x2 charge density wave (CDW) phases in monolayer 1H-NbSe2, which become energetically favorable over the conventional 3x3 CDWs under modest biaxial tensile strain of about 1%. These strain-induced CDW phases coexist with numerous topological states characterized by Z2 topology, high mirror Chern numbers, topological nodal lines, and higher-order topological states, which we have verified rigorously by computing the topological indices and the presence of robust edge states and localized corner states. Remarkably, these topological properties emerge because of the CDW rather than a pre-existing topology in the pristine phase. These results elucidate the interplay between correlations, topology, and geometry in 2D materials and indicate that strain-induced correlation effects can be used to engineer topological states in materials with initially trivial topology. Our findings may be applied in electronics, spintronics, and other advanced quantum devices that require robust and tunable topological states.</description>

      <title>High Curie temperature in diluted magnetic semiconductors (B, Mn)X (X = N, P, As, Sb)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doping nonmagnetic semiconductors with magnetic impurities is a feasible way to obtain diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). It is generally accepted that for the most extensively studied DMS, (Ga, Mn)As, its highest Curie temperature T$_{\text{C}}$ was achieved at 200 K with a Mn concentration of approximately 16\% in experiments. A recent experiment reported record-breaking high electron and hole mobilities in the semiconductor BAs [\href{https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn4290}{Science 377, 437 (2022)}]. Since BAs shares the same zinc-blende structure with GaAs, here we predict four DMSs (B, Mn)X (X $=$ N, P, As, Sb) by density functional theory calculations. Using a rescaling method to diminish the overestimation of Curie temperature, our results indicate that a significantly higher T$_{\text{C}}$ in the range of 467 K to 485 K for (B, Mn)As with a Mn concentration of around 15.6\% and even higher T$_{\text{C}}$ values above the room temperature for (B, Mn)P with a Mn concentration exceeding 9.4\%. Furthermore, using the method of Ab initio Scattering and Transport (AMSET) with first-principles material parameters, we have predicted a hole mobility of 48.9 cm$^{\text{2}}$V$^{\text{-1}}$s$^{\text{-1}}$ at 300 K for (B, Mn)As with the hole concentration of about n$_{\text{h}}$ $=$ 4.2 $\times$ 10$^{\text{19}}$ cm$^{\text{-3}}$, which is about two times larger than the hole mobility at 300 K in the calculations for (Ga, Mn)As. The hole mobility of (B, Mn)As can be enhanced faster than that of (Ga, Mn)As when the hole concentration is decreased. Our findings predict the emergence of a new family of DMS, (B, Mn)X, and are expected to stimulate both experimental and theoretical studies of the DMS with possible high T$_{\text{C}}$.</description>

      <title>Feature-based prediction of properties of cross-linked epoxy polymers by molecular dynamics and machine learning techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations, compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy polymeric systems.</description>

      <title>Substrate stabilization of Jahn-Teller distortion in a single molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge-state transitions of a single Cu-phthalocyanine molecule adsorbed on an insulating layer of NaCl on Cu(111) are probed by means of alternate charging scanning tunneling microscopy. Real-space imaging of the electronic transitions reveals the Jahn-Teller distortion occurring upon formation of the first and second anionic charge states. The experimental findings are rationalized by a theoretical many-body model which highlights the crucial role played by the substrate. The latter enhances and stabilizes the intrinsic Jahn-Teller distortion of the negatively charged molecule hosting a degenerate pair of single-particle frontier orbitals. Consequently, two excess electrons are found to occupy, in the ground state, the same localized orbital, despite a larger Coulomb repulsion than the one for the competing delocalized electronic configuration. Control over the charging sequence by varying the applied bias voltage is also predicted.</description>

      <title>Coherently Coupled Carrier and Phonon Dynamics in Elemental Tellurium Probed by XUV Transient Absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The narrow bandgap semiconductor elemental tellurium (Te) has a unique electronic structure due to strong spin-orbit splitting and a lack of inversion symmetry of it's helical lattice. Using broadband extreme ultraviolet core-level transient absorption, we measure simultaneously the coherently coupled photo-induced carrier and lattice dynamics at the Te N$_{4,5}$ edge initiated by a few-cycle NIR pulse. Ultrafast excitation of carriers leads to a coherently excited A$_{\rm{1}}$ phonon oscillation and the generation of a hot carrier population distribution that oscillates in temperature, and the phonon excursion and hot carrier temperature are $\pi$ out of phase with respect to each other. The depths of modulation suggest a significant coupling between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in Te. A long-lived shift of the absorption edge suggests an excited state of Te in a new equilibrium potential energy surface that lives on the order of the carrier recombination timescale. The observed phonon-induced oscillations of the hot carriers are supportive of a change in the metallicity, whereby Te becomes more metallic with increasing phonon-induced displacement. Additionally, near the Fermi level we observe an energy-dependent phase of the displacive excitation of the A$_{\rm{1}}$ phonon mode. The discovery of coherent coupling between the lattice and hot carriers in Te provides the basis to investigate coherent interactions between spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The results spectrally and temporally resolve the correlation between photo-excited hot carriers and coherent lattice excitations, providing insight on the optical manipulation of the Te electronic structure at high carrier densities exceeding $10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Self-passivation reduces the Fermi level pinning in the metal-semiconductor contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metal-induced gap states (MIGS) are commonly believed to cause the strong Femi level pinning (FLP) in the metal-semiconductors contacts. Here, we unravel unambiguously that the dangling bonds-induced interface states play a crucial role, even comparable with MIGS. The first-principles calculations show that metal-Ge and metal-Si contacts should possess a similar FLP strength if they adopt an identical interface bonding configuration: the reconstructed bonding configuration renders Si and Ge having pinning factors of 0.16 and 0.11, respectively, and the ideal non-reconstructed bonding configuration gives them pinning factors of 0.05 and 0, respectively. We illustrate that Si favors the reconstructed bonding configuration, and Ge favors the ideal non-reconstructed bonding configuration after metal deposition. The self-passivation of the dangling bonds substantially reduces the interface gap states to give a much weaker FLP in the metal-Si contacts than in the metal-Ge contacts. We also demonstrate that the full passivation of the interface dangling bonds can further increase the pinning factor to 0.5 by further reducing the interface gap states. These findings shed new light on alleviating the Femi level pinning to lower the contact resistance for Si and emerging materials towards advanced semiconductor technology.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Bandgap in Nano-Scale Graphite: A Computational and Experimental Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bandgaps in layered materials are critical for enabling functionalities such as tunable photodetection, efficient energy conversion, and nonlinear optical responses, which are essential for next-generation photonic and quantum devices. Gap engineering could form heterostructures with complementary materials like transition metal dichalcogenides or perovskites for multi-functional devices. Graphite, conventionally regarded as a gapless material, exhibits a bandgap of ~100 meV in nano-scale patterned highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Raman measurements. Our state-of-the-art calculations, incorporating photoemission matrix element effects, predict this bandgap with remarkable accuracy and attribute it to mechanical distortions introduced during patterning. This work bridges theory and experiment, providing the direct evidence of a tunable bandgap in HOPG. Beyond its fundamental significance, this finding opens new possibilities for designing materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling advancements in terahertz devices and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite their potential, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, using first-principles calculations. CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, enabling the manipulation of the N\'eel vector in CrSb films through a suitable ferromagnetic substrate. The anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution. Our results demonstrate that CrSb provides a good platform for investigating the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort Carbon Nanotubes with Luminescent Color Centers are Bright NIR-II Nano-Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the fields of bioimaging, photonics, and quantum science, it is equally crucial to combine high brightness with nanoscale size in short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters. However, such nano-emitters are currently lacking. Here, we report that when functionalized with luminescent color centers, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with length much shorter than 100 nm, are surprisingly bright in the near-infrared second-biological window (NIR-II) of the SWIR domain. We discuss the origin of this exceptional brightness based on the uncontrollable presence of quenching defects in dispersed carbon nanotubes. We further investigate the nonlinear photoluminescence behavior of color centers functionalized carbon nanotubes in response to varying excitation conditions, spanning from ensemble measurements to single-nanotube experiments. We discuss how this behavior influences the determination of their photoluminescence quantum yields, which can reach values as high as 20% for ultrashort ones detected at the single nanotube level. Notably, the corresponding NIR-II brightness exceeds that of well-known visible emitters, including quantum dots. After rendering them biocompatible, we demonstrate point-spread function engineering and high-resolution, 3-dimensional single-particle tracking using these bright ultrashort carbon nanotubes allowing nanoscale imaging in the NIR-II window within thick brain tissue.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectricity with metastable polar state from Kittel model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have revisited the Kittel model that describes antiferroelectricity (AFE) in terms of two sublattices of spontaneous polarization with antiparallel couplings. By constructing the comprehensive phase diagram including the antiferroelectric, ferroelectric, and paraelectric phases in the parameter space, we identified an AFE phase with stable antipolar states and metastable polar state (SAMP) due to the weak coupling between sublattices. We found that the metastability of the polar state in SAMP phase could lead to apparent remanent polarization, depending on the measurement timescale. This explains the observed ferroelectric behavior of orthorhombic hafnia, which is predicted to be antipolar by density functional theories.</description>

      <title>Towards "on-demand" van der Waals epitaxy with hpc-driven online ensemble sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to achieve targeted epitaxial growth involves exploring a vast parameter space of thermodynamical and kinetic drivers (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical potential etc). This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome to accelerate synthesis and characterization of novel materials with complex dependencies on local chemical environment, temperature and lattice-strains, specifically nanoscale heterostructures of layered 2D materials. We combine the strength of next generation supercomputers at the extreme scale, machine learning and classical molecular dynamics simulations within an adaptive real time closed-loop virtual environment steered by Bayesian optimization to enable asynchronous ensemble sampling of the synthesis space, and apply it to the recrystallization phenomena of amorphous transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer to form stack moir\'e heterostructures under various growth parameters. We show that such asynchronous ensemble sampling frameworks for materials simulations can be promising towards achieving on-demand epitaxy of van der Waals stacked moir\'e devices, paving the way towards a robust autonomous materials synthesis pipeline to enable unprecedented discovery of new functionalities.</description>

      <title>Exploring Three-Atom-Thick Gold Structures as a Benchmark for Atomic-Scale Calibration of Break-Junction Systems</title>

Abstract: We present an in-depth study of electronic transport in atomic-sized gold contacts using Break-Junction (BJ) techniques under cryogenic and ambient conditions. Our experimental results, supported by classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations and ab initio calculations, provide compelling evidence for the formation of three-atom-thick structures in gold nanocontacts under tensile stress. These findings extend previous studies that confirmed the existence of one- and two-atom-thick chains. Beyond identifying these novel atomic configurations, we introduce a fast and robust calibration method for Break-Junction systems, leveraging the characteristic length of these structures to convert piezo displacement into absolute distance in angstroms. Our approach presents a novel and robust method for calibrating atomic distances in atomic conductor systems at both cryogenic and room temperatures. The results also enable the assessment of electrode sharpness, even at room conditions.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Characterization of Al/AlxOy/Al Josephson Junctions at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</description>
