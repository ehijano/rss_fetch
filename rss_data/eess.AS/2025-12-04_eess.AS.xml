      <title>Comparing Unsupervised and Supervised Semantic Speech Tokens: A Case Study of Child ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete speech tokens have gained attention for their storage efficiency and integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). They are commonly categorized into acoustic and semantic tokens, with the latter being more advantageous for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Traditionally, unsupervised K-means clustering has been used to extract semantic speech tokens from Speech Foundation Models (SFMs). Recently, supervised methods, such as finite scalar quantization (FSQ) trained with ASR loss, have emerged for speech generation. Both approaches leverage pre-trained SFMs, benefiting low-resource tasks such as child ASR.
  This paper systematically compares supervised and unsupervised semantic speech tokens for child ASR. Results show that supervised methods not only outperform unsupervised ones but even unexpectedly surpass continuous representations, and they perform well even in ultra-low bitrate settings. These findings highlight the advantages of supervised semantic tokens and offer insights for improving discrete speech tokenization.</description>

      <title>A Universal Harmonic Discriminator for High-quality GAN-based Vocoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of GAN-based vocoders, the discriminator, as a crucial component, has been developed recently. In our work, we focus on improving the time-frequency based discriminator. Particularly, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representation is usually used as input of time-frequency based discriminator. However, the STFT spectrogram has the same frequency resolution at different frequency bins, which results in an inferior performance, especially for singing voices. Motivated by this, we propose a universal harmonic discriminator for dynamic frequency resolution modeling and harmonic tracking. Specifically, we design a harmonic filter with learnable triangular band-pass filter banks, where each frequency bin has a flexible bandwidth. Additionally, we add a half-harmonic to capture fine-grained harmonic relationships at low-frequency band. Experiments on speech and singing datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed discriminator on both subjective and objective metrics.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Framework for Mapping Imagined Auditory MEG into Listened Brain Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding imagined speech engages complex neural processes that are difficult to interpret due to uncertainty in timing and the limited availability of imagined-response datasets. In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music.</description>

      <title>Head, posture, and full-body gestures in interactive communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When face-to-face communication becomes effortful due to background noise or interfering talkers, the role of visual cues becomes increasingly important for communication success. While previous research has selectively examined head or hand movements, here we explore movements of the whole body in acoustically adverse conditions. We hypothesized that increasing background noise in conversations would lead to increased gesture frequency in hand, head, trunk, and leg movements typical of conversation. Increased use of hand movements should support the speaker's role, while increased head and trunk movements may help the listener. We conducted a free dyadic conversation experiment with normal-hearing participants (n=8) in a virtual acoustic environment. Conversational movements were described with a newly developed labeling system for typical conversational actions, and the frequency of individual types was analyzed. In addition, we analyzed gesture quality by assessing hand-speech synchrony, with the hypothesis that higher levels of background noise would lead to a loss of synchrony according to an interactive coupling model. Higher noise levels led to increased hand-gesture complexity during speaking and listening, more pronounced up-down head movements, and contrary to expectations, head movements during listening generally decreased relative to speaking. Synchrony and peak velocity were unaffected by noise, while gesture quality scaled only modestly. The results support previous findings regarding gesturing frequency, but we found only limited evidence for changes in speech-gesture synchrony. This work reveals communication patterns of the whole body and illustrates multimodal adaptation to communication demands.</description>

      <title>IDMap: A Pseudo-Speaker Generator Framework Based on Speaker Identity Index to Vector Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facilitated by the speech generation framework that disentangles speech into content, speaker, and prosody, voice anonymization is accomplished by substituting the original speaker embedding vector with that of a pseudo-speaker. In this framework, the pseudo-speaker generation forms a fundamental challenge. Current pseudo-speaker generation methods demonstrate limitations in the uniqueness of pseudo-speakers, consequently restricting their effectiveness in voice privacy protection. Besides, existing model-based methods suffer from heavy computation costs. Especially, in the large-scale scenario where a huge number of pseudo-speakers are generated, the limitations of uniqueness and computational inefficiency become more significant. To this end, this paper proposes a framework for pseudo-speaker generation, which establishes a mapping from speaker identity index to speaker vector in the feedforward architecture, termed IDMap. Specifically, the framework is specified into two models: IDMap-MLP and IDMap-Diff. Experiments were conducted on both small- and large-scale evaluation datasets. Small-scale evaluations on the LibriSpeech dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed IDMap framework in enhancing the uniqueness of pseudo-speakers, thereby improving voice privacy protection, while at a reduced computational cost. Large-scale evaluations on the MLS and Common Voice datasets further justified the superiority of the IDMap framework regarding the stability of the voice privacy protection capability as the number of pseudo-speakers increased. Audio samples and open-source code can be found in https://github.com/VoicePrivacy/IDMap.</description>

      <title>Direction-of-Arrival and Noise Covariance Matrix joint estimation for beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a joint estimation method for the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) and the Noise Covariance Matrix (NCM) tailored for beamforming applications. Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics.</description>

      <title>First Deep Learning Approach to Hammering Acoustics for Stem Stability Assessment in Total Hip Arthroplasty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio event classification has recently emerged as a promising approach in medical applications. In total hip arthroplasty (THA), intra-operative hammering acoustics provide critical cues for assessing the initial stability of the femoral stem, yet variability due to femoral morphology, implant size, and surgical technique constrains conventional assessment methods. We propose the first deep learning framework for this task, employing a TimeMIL model trained on Log-Mel Spectrogram features and enhanced with pseudo-labeling. On intra-operative recordings, the method achieved 91.17 % +/- 2.79 % accuracy, demonstrating reliable estimation of stem stability. Comparative experiments further show that reducing the diversity of femoral stem brands improves model performance, although limited dataset size remains a bottleneck. These results establish deep learning-based audio event classification as a feasible approach for intra-operative stability assessment in THA.</description>

      <title>Musical consonance: a review of theory and evidence on perception and preference of auditory roughness in humans and other animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origins of consonance in human music has long been contested, and today there are three primary hypotheses: aversion to roughness, preference for harmonicity, and learned preferences from cultural exposure. While the evidence is currently insufficient to disentangle the contributions of these hypotheses, I propose several reasons why roughness is an especially promising area for future study. The aim of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate roughness theory and models, experimental data, to highlight areas that deserve further research. I identify 2 key areas: There are fundamental issues with the definition and interpretation of results due to tautology in the definition of roughness, and the lack of independence in empirical measurements. Despite extensive model development, there are many duplications and models have issues with data quality and overfitting. Future theory development should aim for model simplicity, and extra assumptions, features and parameters should be evaluated systematically. Model evaluation should aim to maximise the breadth of stimuli that are predicted.</description>
