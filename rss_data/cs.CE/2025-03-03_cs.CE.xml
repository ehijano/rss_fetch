      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the GPU porting through OpenACC directives of the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) application, a high-resolution atmospheric model. The code is written in Fortran~90 and features parallel (distributed) execution through spatial domain decomposition. We assess the performance of the GPU offloading, comparing the time-to-solution on regular and accelerated HPC nodes. %comparing the computational time between distributed and accelerated nodes. A weak scaling analysis is conducted and portability across NVIDIA A100 and H100 hardware %and AMD hardware is discussed. Finally, we show how targeted kernels can benefit from further optimization with Kernel Tuner, a GPU kernels auto-tuning package.</description>

      <title>A novel boundary integrated neural networks for in plane fracture mechanics analysis of elastic and piezoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel approach, termed boundary integrated neural networks (BINNs), for analyzing in-plane crack problems within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The proposed approach integrates artificial neural networks (ANNs) with classical boundary integral equations (BIEs), enabling an efficient and accurate evaluation of partial differential equations (PDEs) associated with fracture mechanics. Additionally, novel special ANN-based crack-tip elements, the Special crack-tip Neural Networks(SPNNs) are developed to improve the modeling of displacement and stress fields in regions near crack tips. These specialized elements integrate the asymptotic characteristics of fracture mechanics into the neural network framework, ensuring enhanced accuracy in capturing the intricate singularities and steep gradients near the crack tips. Compared to conventional simulation tools in fracture mechanics, the present method offers several distinct advantages. First, by embedding higher-order fracture mechanics principles into the neural networks, the method achieves a more accurate and reliable representation of the near-tip fields, even when using relatively large crack-tip elements. Second, the SPNNs, which incorporates information about varying near-tip singularity orders, improve the method's versatility in solving problems involving complex and diverse crack-tips geometries. Moreover, the method demonstrates excellent computational efficiency due to the dimensionality reduction achieved by employing BIEs. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed framework serves as a reliable, robust, and accurate tool for addressing fracture mechanics problems, offering substantial advantages over conventional numerical approaches.</description>

      <title>Detection of anomalies in cow activity using wavelet transform based features</title>

Abstract: In Precision Livestock Farming, detecting deviations from optimal or baseline values - i.e. anomalies in time series - is essential to allow undertaking corrective actions rapidly. Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Large Language Models for ESG Activity Detection in Financial Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into corporate decision-making is a fundamental aspect of sustainable finance. However, ensuring that business practices align with evolving regulatory frameworks remains a persistent challenge. AI-driven solutions for automatically assessing the alignment of sustainability reports and non-financial disclosures with specific ESG activities could greatly support this process. Yet, this task remains complex due to the limitations of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts and the scarcity of structured, high-quality datasets. In this paper, we investigate the ability of current-generation LLMs to identify text related to environmental activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their performance can be significantly enhanced through fine-tuning on a combination of original and synthetically generated data. To this end, we introduce ESG-Activities, a benchmark dataset containing 1,325 labelled text segments classified according to the EU ESG taxonomy. Our experimental results show that fine-tuning on ESG-Activities significantly enhances classification accuracy, with open models such as Llama 7B and Gemma 7B outperforming large proprietary solutions in specific configurations. These findings have important implications for financial analysts, policymakers, and AI researchers seeking to enhance ESG transparency and compliance through advanced natural language processing techniques.</description>

      <title>AI in Supply Chain Risk Assessment: A Systematic Literature Review and Bibliometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10895v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supply chain risk assessment (SCRA) is pivotal for ensuring resilience in increasingly complex global supply networks. While existing reviews have explored traditional methodologies, they often neglect emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications and mostly lack combined systematic and bibliometric analyses. This study addresses these gaps by integrating a systematic literature review with bibliometric analysis, examining 1,903 articles (2015-2025) from Google Scholar and Web of Science, with 54 studies selected through PRISMA guidelines. Our findings reveal that ML models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and hybrid approaches, significantly enhance risk prediction accuracy and adaptability in post-pandemic contexts. The bibliometric analysis identifies key trends, influential authors, and institutional contributions, highlighting China and the United States as leading research hubs. Practical insights emphasize the integration of explainable AI (XAI) for transparent decision-making, real-time data utilization, and blockchain for traceability. The study underscores the necessity of dynamic strategies, interdisciplinary collaboration, and continuous model evaluation to address challenges such as data quality and interpretability. By synthesizing AI-driven methodologies with resilience frameworks, this review provides actionable guidance for optimizing supply chain risk management, fostering adaptability, and informing future research in evolving risk landscapes.</description>

      <title>Maximal Extractable Value in Decentralized Finance: Taxonomy, Detection, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) leverages blockchain-enabled smart contracts to deliver automated and trustless financial services without the need for intermediaries. However, the public visibility of financial transactions on the blockchain can be exploited, as participants can reorder, insert, or remove transactions to extract value, often at the expense of others. This extracted value is known as the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). MEV causes financial losses and consensus instability, disrupting the security, efficiency, and decentralization goals of the DeFi ecosystem. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze, detect, and mitigate MEV to safeguard DeFi. Our comprehensive survey offers a holistic view of the MEV landscape in the DeFi ecosystem. We present an in-depth understanding of MEV through a novel taxonomy of MEV transactions supported by real transaction examples. We perform a critical comparative analysis of various MEV detection approaches, evaluating their effectiveness in identifying different transaction types. Furthermore, we assess different categories of MEV mitigation strategies and discuss their limitations. We identify the challenges of current mitigation and detection approaches and discuss potential solutions. This survey provides valuable insights for researchers, developers, stakeholders, and policymakers, helping to curb and democratize MEV for a more secure and efficient DeFi ecosystem.</description>
