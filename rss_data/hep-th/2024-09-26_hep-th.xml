      <title>Quiver Subtraction on the Higgs Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper classifies all Higgs branch Higgsing patterns for simply-laced unitary quiver gauge theories with eight supercharges (including multiple loops) and introduces a Higgs branch subtraction algorithm. All possible minimal transitions are given, identifying differences between slices that emerge on the Higgs and Coulomb branches. In particular, the algorithm is sensitive to global information including monodromies and Namikawa-Weyl groups. Guided by symplectic duality, the algorithm further determines the global symmetry on the Coulomb branch, and verifies the exclusion of $C$ type or $F_4$ global symmetry for (simply-laced) unitary quiver gauge theories. The Higgs branches of some unitary quivers are verified to give slices in the nilpotent cones of exceptional simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Heterotic Moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent results for heterotic moduli and the Hull--Strominger system. In particular, we discuss mathematical properties of the recently derived deformation operator $\bar D$ associated to the deformation complex of heterotic $SU(3)$ solutions. We review results on Serre duality, showing that the operator has a vanishing index, and discuss a notion of \v{C}ech cohomology and a particular instance of a Dolbeault theorem for $\bar D$. Specifically, the cohomology parametrising infinitesimal deformations is isomorphic to the first \v{C}ech cohomology of an associated cochain complex. This will be useful for future research, as it provides a more algebraic handle on the heterotic moduli problem, which is useful for understanding notions of stability, geometric invariants, and enumerative geometry for the Hull--Strominger system.</description>

      <title>Simulating black hole quantum dynamics on an optical lattice using the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low energy model for simulating an analog black hole on an optical lattice using ultracold atoms. Assuming the validity of the holographic principle, we employ the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which describes a system of randomly infinite range interacting fermions, also conjectured to be an exactly solvable UV-complete model for an extremal black hole in a higher dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) dilaton gravity. At low energies, the SYK model exhibits an emergent conformal symmetry and is dual to the extremal black hole solution in near AdS2 spacetime. Furthermore, we show how the SYK maximally chaotic behaviour at large N limit, found to be dual to a gauge theory in higher dimensions, can also be employed as a non-trivial investigation tool for the holographic principle. The proposed setup is a theoretical platform to realize the SYK model with relevant exotic effects and behaviour at low energies as a highly non-trivial example of the AdS/CFT duality and a framework for studying black holes.</description>

      <title>Multipartite information in sparse SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theories that admit gravity dual, specific inequalities involving entanglement entropy between arbitrary disjoint spatial regions hold. An example is the negativity of tripartite information. Inspired by this, we investigate the analogous entropy inequalities in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and sparse SYK models, which involve the entanglement among different flavors of Majorana fermions rather than spatial entanglement. Sparse SYK models are models where some of the SYK couplings are set to zero. Since these models have been argued to admit gravity duals up to a certain sparseness, it is interesting to see whether the multipartite entanglement structure changes in a sparseness-dependent manner. In the parameter space explored by our numerical analysis, which we performed upto five parties, we find that all entropy inequalities are satisfied for any temperature and degree of sparseness for an arbitrary choice of flavor subregions. In addition, if we plot the multipartite entanglement entropy in terms of purity, the only significant effect of sparseness is to change the range of purity. Thus, we conclude that multipartite information is almost unaffected by sparseness. As a counterexample, we also show that in a vector model of $N$-flavored Majorana fermions which contains no random variables, choices of subregions exist for which the entropy inequalities are violated.</description>

      <title>Orbifold ETW brane and half-indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the half-indices of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theories of orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. We find precise matching pairs of the half-indices as strong evidence of dualities of the half-BPS boundary conditions and interfaces. The half-indices encode the spectra of excitations on the holographically dual orbifold ETW brane and giant gravitons. The exact form of the index for the orbifold ETW giant gravitons is obtained from the giant graviton expansion of the half-index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a black hole surrounded by a fluid of strings within the framework of Rastall gravity. We analyze the behavior of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations, focusing on the influence of the black hole charge $Q$ and angular momentum $l$ on the quasinormal frequencies. Our numerical results reveal a significant dependence on the parameter $\varepsilon$. These trends are consistent across different types of perturbations, emphasizing the relationship between black hole parameters and QNMs behavior.</description>

      <title>Restoring Causality in Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating higher curvature terms into gravity theories modifies the classical field equations, potentially leading to theoretical issues like Shapiro time advancements that violate the Camanho, Edelstein, Maldacena, and Zhiboedov (CEMZ) causality criterion. We explore this criterion within the context of Generalised Quadratic Gravity (GQG), a higher curvature theory with a distinct graviton three-point coupling from General Relativity (GR). By constructing an exact shock wave solution of GQG and calculating the Shapiro time shift for a massless probe graviton, we demonstrate that it can remain strictly positive within a classically allowed parameter space of couplings, ensuring the theory's adherence to the CEMZ criterion. This finding indicates that GQG can offer a causal extension beyond GR, paving the way for further exploration into the consistency of classical higher curvature gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computational aspects of detecting topological order in a quantum many-body system. We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>For a flat Universe, $C_P/C_V=-q$! $-$ another coincidence in Cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with gravitational thermodynamics on the dynamical apparent horizon of an FLRW universe with dissipation. The dissipation is assumed to arise due to adiabatic gravitational particle creation. For the thermodynamic study, we consider the Bekenstein-Hawking formalism and also assume a nonzero curvature $\kappa$ for a general study. In particular, we study the unified first law, the generalized second law, and thermodynamic stability in our model. The specific heat capacities are taken into account for the study of thermodynamic stability. Our study reveals a fascinating result! The ratio of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure and that at constant volume in a flat FLRW universe with dissipation is nothing but the negative of the deceleration parameter. In classical thermodynamics, this ratio is known as the isentropic expansion factor or (for ideal gases) the adiabatic index. A more interesting fact that has come to light is that this relation holds true in the $\Lambda$CDM model also! So, this is actually a generic result and is independent of the cosmological model used. We discuss the implications of this result on the evolution of the Universe. Finally, we determine the constraints on the effective equation of state which guarantees thermodynamic stability in our model.</description>

      <title>Computing $G$-Crossed Extensions and Orbifolds of Vertex Operator Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop tools for computing $G$-crossed extensions of braided tensor categories, including all coherence data (associator, braiding, tensor structures). Their equivariantisations describe representation categories of fixed-point vertex operator algebras, also called orbifolds. The seminal work of Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik asserts the existence and uniqueness of the $G$-crossed extensions we construct.
  In particular, for the group $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$ acting as inversion on a discriminant form or metric group, we explicitly construct a braided $\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed tensor category with a nondegenerate braiding that generalises the Tambara-Yamagami category, now with more than one simple object in the twisted sector. Its equivariantisation yields the modular tensor category of the orbifold of a lattice vertex operator algebra under a lift of $-\mathrm{id}$.
  In order to derive the above result, we show that $G$-crossed extensions and condensations by commutative algebras commute appropriately, leading to an effective method for constructing new $G$-crossed extensions. Based on this, we also outline a strategy for addressing the general problem of lattice orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Deformation of a one dimensional ferromagnetic domain wall due to double exchange interaction with a free electron system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. We find that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is greatly deformed towards larger width. For double magnetic wall systems the electronic energy depends on the relative chirality of the domain walls while the conductance is basically independent of it. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.</description>

      <title>Black holes at a crossroads: late-stage evaporation in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity black hole evaporation leads to sudden bursts of energy and loss of information. It can be argued that these phenomena happen in the final stages of evaporation, where the semiclassical approximation needs to be refined with quantum corrections also for the gravitational interaction. A natural way to describe gravity at high energies is to add quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action, i.e. quadratic gravity. At the cosmological level it is known that its classical solutions can give rise to a model of inflation that matches observations strikingly well, while in an astrophysical context it allows for the possibility of non-Schwarzschild black holes at small masses. These solutions have very peculiar properties, due to the presence of a massive spin-2 particle corresponding to a ghost at the quantum level. The branch of non-Schwarzschild solutions crosses the one of Schwarzschild ones at a specific mass which could be between the one of an asteroid and the Planck mass, depending on the value of a slightly constrained free parameter. By analyzing their dynamical stability and thermodynamical properties, we investigate what could happen to a black hole that has evaporated to this crossing point. While this investigation might not solve the problem of the endpoint of evaporation, it can shed light on the directions it might take during its last moments.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality defects in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We show that a universe with a non-minimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics around a black hole with weakly coupled global monopole charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with weakly nonminimally coupled monopole charge. We analytically and numerically investigate light ray propagation around such a black hole by employing the common Lagrangian formalism. Our analysis encompasses both radial and angular geodesics, for which we present analytical solutions in terms of incomplete Lauricella hypergeometric functions. Additionally, we explore the impact of the coupling constant on geodesic motion. Based on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, we constrain the black hole parameters, resulting in a coupling constant range of $-0.5 M^2\lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.5 M^2$. Throughout our analysis, we simulate all possible trajectories and, where necessary, perform numerical inversion of the included integrals.</description>

Abstract: Correlation functions of primordial density fluctuations provide an exciting probe of the physics governing the earliest moments of our Universe. However, the standard approach to compute them is technically challenging. Theoretical predictions are therefore available only in restricted classes of theories. In this Letter, we present a complete method to systematically compute tree-level inflationary correlators. This method is based on following the time evolution of equal-time correlators and it accurately captures all physical effects in any theory. These theories are conveniently formulated at the level of inflationary fluctuations, and can feature any number of degrees of freedom with arbitrary dispersion relations and masses, coupled through any type of time-dependent interactions. We demonstrate the power of this approach by exploring the properties of the cosmological collider signal, a discovery channel for new high-energy physics, in theories with strong mixing and in the presence of features. This work lays the foundation for a universal program to assist our theoretical understanding of inflationary physics and generate theoretical data for an unbiased interpretation of upcoming cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: In two-dimensional critical loop models, including the $O(n)$ and Potts models, the spectrum is exactly known, as are a few structure constants or ratios thereof. Using numerical conformal bootstrap methods, we study $235$ of the simplest 4-point structure constants. For each structure constant, we find an analytic expression as a product of two factors: 1) a universal function of conformal dimensions, built from Barnes' double Gamma function, and 2) a polynomial function of loop weights, whose degree obeys a simple upper bound. We conjecture that all structure constants are of this form.
  For a few 4-point functions, we build corresponding observables in a lattice loop model. From numerical lattice results, we extract amplitude ratios that depend neither on the lattice size nor on the lattice coupling. These ratios agree with the corresponding ratios of 4-point structure constants.</description>

      <title>Scattering of kinks in scalar-field models with higher-order self-interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order scalar field models in two dimensions, including the $\phi^8$ model, have been researched. It has been shown that for some special cases of the minima positions of the potential, the explicit kink solutions can be found. However, in physical applications, it is very important to know all the explicit solutions of a model for any minima position. In the present study, with the help of some deformation functions, we have shown that higher-order scalar field theories can be obtained with explicit kinks. In particular, we introduced two deformation functions that, when applied to the well known $\phi^4$ and $\phi^6$ models, produce modified $\phi^8$ and $\phi^{10}$ models, respectively, with all their explicit kink-like solutions which depend on a single parameter. Since this parameter controls the position of the minima of the potential, we have found interesting new solutions in many distinct cases. We have also studied the kink mass, the behavior of the excitation spectra and several kink-antikink collisions for these two new modified models. The collision outcome is determined by the initial configuration, specifically the sequence in which the kink-antikink and antikink-kink pairings emerge. Another interesting finding is the suppression of resonance windows, which may be explained by the presence of a set of internal modes in the model.</description>

      <title>Covariant and Manifestly Projective Invariant Formulation of Thomas-Whitehead Gravity</title>

Abstract: Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravity is a recently formulated projectively invariant extension of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Projective geometry was used long ago by Thomas et. al. to succinctly package equivalent paths encoded by the geodesic equation. Projective invariance in gravity has further origins in string theory through a geometric action constructed from the method of coadjoint orbits using the Virasoro Algebra. A projectively invariant connection arises from this construction, a part of which is known as the diffeomorphism field. TW gravity exploits projective Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action functional to endow the diffeomorphism field with dynamics, while allowing the theory to collapse to general relativity in the limit that the diffeomorphism field vanishes and the connection becomes Levi-Civita. In the original formulation of TW gravity, the diffeomorphism field is projectively invariant but not tensorial and the connection is projectively invariant but not affine. In this paper we reformulate TW gravity in terms of projectively invariant tensor fields and a projectively invariant covariant derivative, derive field equations respecting these symmetries, and show that the field equations obtained are classically equivalent across formulations. This provides a 'Rosetta Stone' between this newly constructed covariant and projective invariant formulation of TW gravity and the original formulation that was manifestly projective invariant, but not covariant.</description>

Abstract: In this work we conjecture the Coulomb branch partition function, including flux and instanton contributions, for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector multiplet on weighted projective space $\mathbb{CP}^2_{\boldsymbol{N}}$ for equivariant Donaldson-Witten and ``Pestun-like'' theories. More precisely, we claim that this partition function agrees with the one computed on a certain branched cover of $\mathbb{CP}^2$ upon matching conical deficit angles with corresponding branch indices. Our conjecture is substantiated by checking that similar partition functions on spindles agree with their equivalent on certain branched covers of $\mathbb{CP}^1$. We compute the one-loop determinant on the branched cover of $\mathbb{CP}^2$ for all flux sectors via dimensional reduction from the $\mathcal{N}=1$ vector multiplet on a branched five-sphere along a free $S^1$-action. This work paves the way for obtaining partition functions on more generic symplectic toric orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Massive gravity generalization of $T\overline{T}$ deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the two-dimensional massive gravity description of $T\overline{T}$ deformations, we propose a direct generalization in $d$ dimensions. Our methodology indicates that all terms up to order $d$ are present in the deformation. In two dimensions, $T\overline{T}$ is enhanced by a linear and a constant term, and exhibits an interesting behaviour regarding the deformed spectrum and correlators. At certain limits, this deformation can reduce to $T\overline{T}$ or $T\overline{T}+\Lambda_{2}$ consistently. Using the massive gravity method, we obtain the classically deformed action of a sigma model of bosons and fermions interacting with an arbitrary potential, extending previous results. As a consequence, a proposal regarding the deformation of higher-derivative theories is made. Moreover, a standard dimensional reduction procedure is presented, with the resulting operator matching the form of prior findings under certain assumptions. In $d\geq2$, we provide the exact structure of the quadratic terms in agreement with previous approaches, as well as the structure of the linear and constant terms. All higher order contributions are not easily evaluated, yet we derive the complete answer for all cases up to seven dimensions. Under certain conditions, these terms vanish, resulting in a quadratic operator. The trace-flow equation for this family of deformations is also derived. Finally, we investigate the class of root-$T\overline{T}$ operators in various dimensions within the scope of this formalism.</description>

      <title>Complementarity for a Dynamical Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity posits that the interior of a black hole is not independent from its Hawking radiation. This leads to an apparent violation of causality: the interior can be acausally affected by operators acting solely on the radiation. We argue that this perspective is misleading and that the black hole interior must be viewed as existing in the causal past of the Hawking radiation, despite the fact that they are spacelike separated in the semiclassical description. Consequently, no operation on the Hawking radiation -- no matter how complex -- can affect the experience of an infalling observer. The black hole interior and the radiation only appear spacelike separated in the semiclassical description because an infalling observer's ability to access complex information is limited; the chaotic dynamics on the horizon, as viewed from the exterior, then converts any effect caused by such an observer to information in the Hawking radiation which cannot be accessed at the semiclassical level. We arrive at the picture described above by considering a unitary exterior description in which the flow of information is strictly causal, which we extend to apply throughout the entire history of black hole evolution, including its formation. This description uses the stretched event horizon as an inner edge of spacetime, on which the information inside is holographically encoded. We argue that the global spacetime picture arises from coarse-graining over black hole microstates, and discuss its relationship with the exterior description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize three complementary approaches to pinpoint the exact form of scattering amplitudes in Schwarzschild spacetime. First, we solve the Regge-Wheeler equation perturbatively in the small-frequency regime. We use the obtained solutions to determine the monodromy in the near-spatial infinity region, which leads to a specific partial differential equation on the elements of the scattering matrix. As a result, it can be written in terms of the elements of the infinitesimal generator of the monodromy transformation and an integration constant. This constant is further related to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili free energy through the resummation of infinitely many instantons. The quasinormal mode frequencies are also studied in the small-frequency approximation.</description>

      <title>Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role. Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary, whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz. We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein equations and the equation for the vector potential</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05253v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called ``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient for quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: The geometric trinity of gravity comprises three distinct formulations of general relativity: (i) the standard formulation describing gravity in terms of spacetime curvature, (ii) the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity describing gravity in terms of spacetime torsion, and (iii) the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR) describing gravity in terms of spacetime non-metricity. In this article, we complete a geometric trinity of non-relativistic gravity, by (a) taking the non-relativistic limit of STEGR to determine its non-relativistic analogue, and (b) demonstrating that this non-metric theory is equivalent to the Newton--Cartan theory and its teleparallel equivalent, i.e., the curvature and the torsion based non-relativistic theories that are both geometrised versions of classical Newtonian gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that type D black holes, encompassed in the large Pleban\'ski--Demia\'nski (PD) family, exhibit a wide class of algebraically general generalizations via the application of Ehlers and Harrison transformations. In this work, we first discuss some mathematical details behind the composition of such transformations, and next, we introduce a qualitative picture of the most general type I generalization of the PD family, dubbed ``Enhanced Pleban\'ski--Demia\'nski'' spacetime. We provide the exact form of the solution in the original PD coordinates, obtained via the simultaneous action of an Ehlers and a Harrison transformation on the vacuum PD geometry. In order to make the physics more transparent, we explicitly construct a rotating and accelerating black hole which further has NUT parameter and electric charges, both of them entering, not only the event horizon, but the Rindler horizon as well. This solution is directly obtained in the ``physical'' coordinates recently proposed by Podolsk\'y and Vr\'atny. Finally, a pedagogical appendix is thoughtfully included, providing readers with a user-friendly step-by-step guide to the Ernst formalism, in an attempt to address and resolve various minor inconsistencies frequently appearing in the relevant literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dark matter, assumed to be composed by weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs), scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei. In order to parameterize the WIMP-nucleon interaction the chiral effective field theory approach is used. Considering only interactions invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal, we examine five interaction types: scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial and tensor. Scattering amplitudes between two nucleons and a WIMP are determined up to second order of chiral perturbation theory. We apply this program to calculate the interaction rate as function of the WIMP mass and of the magnitude of the WIMP-quark coupling constants. From our study, we conclude that the scalar nuclear response functions result much greater than the others due to theirs large combination of low energy constants. We verify that the leading order contributions are dominant in this low energy processes. We also provide an estimate for the background due to atmospheric neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe may give rise to potentially measurable signatures in the cosmic microwave background. We explore different machine learning approaches to classify harmonic-space realizations of the microwave background in the test case of Euclidean $E_1$ topology (the 3-torus) with a cubic fundamental domain of a size scale significantly smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface. This is the first step toward developing a machine learning approach to classification of cosmic topology and likelihood-free inference of topological parameters. Different machine learning approaches are capable of classifying the harmonic-space realizations with accuracy greater than 99% if the topology scale is half of the diameter of the last-scattering surface and orientation of the topology is known. For distinguishing random rotations of these sky realizations from realizations of the covering space, the extreme gradient boosting classifier algorithm performs best with an accuracy of 88%. Slightly lower accuracies of 83% to 87% are obtained with the random forest classifier along with one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. The techniques presented here can also accurately classify non-rotated cubic $E_1$ topology realizations with a topology scale slightly larger than the diameter of the last-scattering surface, if enough training data are provided. While information compressing methods like most machine learning approaches cannot exceed the statistical power of a likelihood-based approach that captures all available information, they potentially offer a computationally cheaper alternative. A principle challenge appears to be accounting for arbitrary orientations of a given topology, although this is also a significant hurdle for likelihood-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring waveforms with non-GR deviations for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental process of detecting and examining the polarization modes of gravitational waves plays a pivotal role in enhancing our grasp on the precise mechanisms behind their generation. A thorough investigation is essential for delving deeper into the essence of gravitational waves and rigorously evaluating and validating the range of modified gravity theories. In this line of interest, a general description of black holes in theories beyond general relativity can serve a meaningful purpose where distinct deviation parameters can be mapped to solutions representing distinct theories. Employing a refined version of the deformed Kerr geometry, which is free from pathological behaviours such as unphysical divergences in the metric, we explore an extreme mass-ratio inspiral system, wherein a stellar-mass object perturbs a supermassive black hole. We compute the effects of deformation parameters on the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, orbital evolution and phase dynamics with leading order post-Newtonian corrections. With the waveform analysis, we assess the plausibility of detecting deviations from general relativity through observations facilitated by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), simultaneously constraining the extent of these deviations. Therefore, this analysis provides an understanding while highlighting the essential role of observations in advancing gravitational phenomena beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Dark energy evolution from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If an ultraviolet fixed point renders quantum gravity renormalizable, the effective potential for a singlet scalar field -- the cosmon -- can be computed according to the corresponding scaling solution of the renormalization group equations. We associate the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the flow away from the fixed point with the scale of present dark energy density or even smaller. This results in a highly predictive scenario for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. It solves the cosmological constant problem dynamically, and may be called "quantum gravity quintessence". A first setting without quantum scale symmetry violation in the neutrino sector could explain the present amount of dark energy, but fails for the constraints on its time evolution. In contrast, a logarithmic scale symmetry violation in the beyond standard model sector responsible for the neutrino masses induces a non-vanishing cosmon-neutrino coupling in the Einstein frame. This yields a cosmology similar to growing neutrino quintessence, which could be compatible with present observations. The small number of unknown parameters turns the scaling solution for quantum gravity into a fundamental explanation of dynamical dark energy which can be falsified.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence between the planar Gross-Neveu and Thirring models at $N=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the Fierz identities predict that the Gross-Neveu and Thirring models should be equivalent when describing systems composed of a single fermionic flavor, $N=1$. Here, we consider the planar version of both models within the framework of the optimized perturbation theory at the two-loop level, in order to verify if the predicted equivalence emerges explicitly when different temperature and density regimes are considered. At vanishing densities, our results indicate that both models indeed describe exactly the same thermodynamics, provided that $N=1$. However, at finite chemical potentials we find that the $N=1$ Fierz equivalence no longer holds. After examining the relevant free energies, we have identified the contributions which lead to this puzzling discrepancy. Finally, we discuss different frameworks in which this (so far open) problem could be further understood and eventually circumvented.</description>

      <title>Hunting for extra dimensions in black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational data of the Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) shadow released by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) are used to investigate eventual deviations in the black hole shadow radius, aiming to seek physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) coming from extra-dimensional theory. We consider the brane-world scenario described by the Randall-Sundrum model and determine the black hole shadow radius correction owing to the higher dimension. From data of the shadow radius in units of BH mass determined by KECK- and VLTI-based estimates, we imposed restrictions on the deviation obtained, and one sets an upper limit to the curvature radius of Anti-de Sitter ($\mathrm{AdS_{5}}$) spacetime $\ell\lesssim4.3\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{AU}$ (at $95\%$ confidence level).</description>

      <title>Finite Algebraic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed algebraic quantum field theory (QFT) for particles that may have structure, called "Structural Algebraic QFT (SAQFT)", we introduce a finite QFT. That is, a QFT for structureless elementary particles that does not require renormalization where loop integrals in the Feynman diagrams are finite. It is an algebraic theory utilizing orthogonal polynomials and based on the structureless sector of SAQFT.</description>

      <title>Basics of Multiple Polyexponential Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of special functions called multiple polyexponential integrals, defined as iterated integrals of the exponential integral $\text{Ei}(z)$. These functions arise in certain perturbative expansions of the local solutions of second-order ODEs around an irregular singularity. In particular, their recursive definition describes the asymptotic behavior of these local solutions. To complement the study of the multiple polyexponential integrals on the entire complex plane, we relate them with two other sets of special functions - the undressed and dressed multiple polyexponential functions - which are characterized by their Taylor series expansions around the origin.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also give an identification of the ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model, which proves that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic. This isomorphism also provides a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles that appear in the latter ring.</description>
