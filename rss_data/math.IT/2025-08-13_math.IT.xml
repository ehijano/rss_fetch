      <title>Achievable Rates of Nanopore-based DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies achievable rates of nanopore-based DNA storage when nanopore signals are decoded using a tractable channel model that does not rely on a basecalling algorithm. Specifically, the noisy nanopore channel (NNC) with the Scrappie pore model generates average output levels via i.i.d. geometric sample duplications corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise (NNC-Scrappie). Simplified message passing algorithms are derived for efficient soft decoding of nanopore signals using NNC-Scrappie. Previously, evaluation of this channel model was limited by the lack of DNA storage datasets with nanopore signals included. This is solved by deriving an achievable rate based on the dynamic time-warping (DTW) algorithm that can be applied to genomic sequencing datasets subject to constraints that make the resulting rate applicable to DNA storage. Using a publicly-available dataset from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), it is demonstrated that coding over multiple DNA strands of $100$ bases in length and decoding with the NNC-Scrappie decoder can achieve rates of at least $0.64-1.18$ bits per base, depending on the channel quality of the nanopore that is chosen in the sequencing device per channel-use, and $0.96$ bits per base on average assuming uniformly chosen nanopores. These rates are pessimistic since they only apply to single reads and do not include calibration of the pore model to specific nanopores.</description>

      <title>Optimum 1-Step Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical majority-logic decoder proposed by Reed for Reed-Muller codes RM(r, m) of order r and length 2^m, unfolds in r+1 sequential steps, decoding message symbols from highest to lowest degree. Several follow-up decoding algorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or at the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some combinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that is, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without sequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r and m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new hard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains this error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a parallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols simultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the erasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to d_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit. To our knowledge, this is the first 1-step decoder for RM codes that achieves both optimal erasure correction and the maximum one-step error correction capability.</description>

      <title>Optimized Arithmetic Coding for Efficient Data Compression in the Resource-Constrained Internet of Things(IoT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) generates vast amounts of heterogeneous data, ranging from sensor readings to log alerts and images, that pose challenges to storage and data transmission in resource-constrained environments. In this context, lossless data compression techniques, like Arithmetic Coding, offer an effective solution owing to their high compression ratio. However, the standard Arithmetic Coding technique is computationally intensive, leading to high memory and processing overhead. This paper proposes an optimized version of Arithmetic coding for the IoT environment that incorporates three improvements using Iterative and Iteration Optimizations for minimizing redundant computations and achieving faster convergence; Principal Component Analysis(PCA) for dimensionality reduction and identifying key features; and lastly, Cardinality reduction for grouping similar probabilities to improve the compression efficiency. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of images and demonstrated significant reductions in the time to compress, CPU utilization, and memory consumption, and preserves data integrity as seen through the low RMSE values. The optimized version of the Arithmetic Coding algorithm achieves an impressive compression ratio of 814:1 and 101 ms to compress a single image. This makes the optimized algorithm suitable for real-time applications and resource-constrained environments for efficient data transmission and storage.</description>

      <title>A Dual Framework for Optimized Data Storage and Retrieval using Lightweight Python Blockchain and Scalable Smart Contracts with IPFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT data demands efficient, secure, and scalable storage solutions on one hand, and efficient data migration and retrieval on the other hand are essential for the systems to be practical and acceptable for different applications. The traditional cloud-based models face latency, security, and high operational costs, while existing bi-directional data storage and retrieval-based IPFS models are not computationally efficient and incur high gas costs at the cost of a necessary blockchain deployment. To overcome the challenges of efficient data migration, we initially developed a 2-way data storage and retrieval system as well as a scalable framework that dynamically monitors and transfers device-generated data to IPFS, records the content identifier(CID) on a blockchain, and enables secure, real-time access via smart contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that the existing work achieved an average data upload time of 117.12 sec for a file size of 500 MB; our framework achieves a faster upload time of 7.63 sec, marking a 93.47% improvement. We further optimize the proposed framework to reduce the file upload time incurred from the smart contracts by introducing a blockchain-inspired, lightweight, and customizable Python framework that replicates the storage and retrieval functionalities of a traditional blockchain, where the file upload time is 4.2 sec, further optimized by 45% from our previous approach, thus demonstrating its efficiency, security and suitability for deploy ment in real-time and critical IoT applications and outperforming the existing IPFS-smart contract based solutions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bicycle Codes with Low Connectivity: Minimum Distance Bounds and Hook Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of certain generalized bicycle (GB) codes beyond the reach of techniques for classical codes capable of even capturing the true minimum distance for some cases. These bounds are then applied to illustrate the existence and analyze two highly degenerate GB code families with parameters $[[d^2+1,2,d]]$ for odd $d \geq 3$ and $[[d^2,2,d]]$ for even $d \geq 4$, both having the property that each check qubit is connected to exactly four data qubits similar to surface codes. For the odd-distance family, we analyze the structure of low-weight logical Pauli operators and demonstrate the existence of a fault-tolerant logical CNOT gate between the two logical qubits, achievable through a simple relabeling of data qubits. We further construct a syndrome extraction pattern for both families that does not imply minimum distance reduction arising from extraction circuit faults that propagate from the check qubits to the data qubits. Finally, we numerically evaluate their logical error rates under a code capacity depolarizing noise model using the belief propagation ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD) and minimum-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoders, yielding thresholds of approximately $14-16\%$ for the odd and even families, very similar to those of rotated surface codes.</description>

      <title>Communication Efficient Robotic Mixed Reality with Gaussian Splatting Cross-Layer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Image selective encryption analysis using mutual information in CNN based embedding space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images. Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a promising direction for image information leakage estimation.</description>

      <title>Improved SINR Approximation for Downlink SDMA-based Networks with Outdated Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the performance of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) remains a critical challenge in next-generation wireless networks. In this context, accurate statistical modeling of the signal-tointerference- plus-noise ratio (SINR) is essential for enabling tractable performance analysis of multi-user systems. This paper presents an improved statistical approximation of the SINR for downlink (DL) MU-MIMO systems with imperfect CSIT. The proposed model retains the analytical simplicity of existing approaches (e.g., Gamma-based approximations) while overcoming their limitations, particularly the underestimation of SINR variance. We evaluate the proposed approximation in the context of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled MIMO DL systems with outdated CSIT. The results demonstrate excellent accuracy across a wide range of system configurations, including varying</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Joint Target Sensing and Proactive Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions for the self-orthogonality of t-generator quasi-cyclic (QC) codes are presented under the Euclidean, Hermitian, and symplectic inner products, respectively. Particularly, by studying the structure of the dual codes of a class of 2-generator QC codes, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the QC codes to be dual-containing under the above three inner products. This class of 2-generator QC codes generalizes many known codes in the literature. Based on the above conditions, we construct several quantum stabilizer codes and quantum synchronizable codes with good parameters, some of which share parameters with certain best-known codes listed in Grassl's code table.</description>

Abstract: We study the monotonicity of information costs: more informative experiments must be more costly. As criteria for informativeness, we consider the standard information orders introduced by Blackwell (1951, 1953) and Lehmann (1988). We provide simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a cost function to be monotone with respect to each order, grounded in their garbling characterizations. Finally, we examine several well-known cost functions from the literature through the lens of these conditions.</description>

Abstract: A new type of link between geometry of symplectic group and entanglement-assisted (EA) quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) is presented. Relations of symplectic subspaces and quaternary additive codes concerning parameters of EAQECCs are described. Thus, parameters of EA stabilizer codes are revealed in the nomenclature of additive codes. Our techniques enable us solve some open problems about optimal EAQECCs and entanglement-assisted quantum minimum distance separable (EAQMDS) codes, and are also useful for designing encoding and decoding quantum circuit of EA stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zak-Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to achieve significantly better performance compared to the standardized Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM), in high delay/Doppler spread scenarios envisaged in next generation communication systems. Zak-OTFS carriers are quasi-periodic pulses in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, characterized by two parameters, (i) the pulse period along the delay axis (``delay period") (Doppler period is related to the delay period), and (ii) the pulse shaping filter. An important practical challenge is enabling support for Zak-OTFS modulation in existing CP-OFDM based modems. In this paper we show that Zak-OTFS modulation with pulse shaping constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth equal to the communication bandwidth $B$) followed by time-windowing with a rectangular window of duration $(T + T_{cp})$ ($T$ is the symbol duration and $T_{cp}$ is the CP duration), can be implemented as a low-complexity precoder over standard CP-OFDM. We also show that the Zak-OTFS de-modulator with matched filtering constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth $B$) followed by rectangular time windowing over duration $T$ can be implemented as a low-complexity post-processing of the CP-OFDM de-modulator output. This proposed ``Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM" architecture enables us to harness the benefits of Zak-OTFS in existing network infrastructure. We also show that the proposed Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM is a family of modulations, with CP-OFDM being a special case when the delay period takes its minimum possible value equal to the inverse bandwidth, i.e., Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM with minimum delay period.</description>
