      <title>TICL: Text-Embedding KNN For Speech In-Context Learning Unlocks Speech Recognition Abilities of Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently demonstrated the ability to perform Speech In-Context Learning (SICL). Selecting effective in-context examples is crucial for SICL performance, yet selection methodologies remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Text-Embedding KNN for SICL (TICL), a simple pipeline that uses semantic context to enhance off-the-shelf large multimodal models' speech recognition ability without fine-tuning. Across challenging automatic speech recognition tasks, including accented English, multilingual speech, and children's speech, our method enables models to surpass zero-shot performance with up to 84.7% relative WER reduction. We conduct ablation studies to show the robustness and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Annotating Satellite Images of Forests with Keywords from a Specialized Corpus in the Context of Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13586</link>

Abstract: The Amazon rain forest is a vital ecosystem that plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and providing habitat for countless species. Deforestation in the Amazon is a major concern as it has a significant impact on global carbon emissions and biodiversity. In this paper, we present a method for detecting deforestation in the Amazon using image pairs from Earth observation satellites. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to compare the images of the same area at different dates and identify changes in the forest cover. We also propose a visual semantic model that automatically annotates the detected changes with relevant keywords. The candidate annotation for images are extracted from scientific documents related to the Amazon region. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of Amazon image pairs and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting deforestation and generating relevant annotations. Our method provides a useful tool for monitoring and studying the impact of deforestation in the Amazon. While we focus on environment applications of our work by using images of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, it is generic enough to be applied to other domains.</description>

      <title>Teacher-Guided Pseudo Supervision and Cross-Modal Alignment for Audio-Visual Video Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) seeks to detect audible, visible, and audio-visual events without temporal annotations. Previous work has emphasized refining global predictions through contrastive or collaborative learning, but neglected stable segment-level supervision and class-aware cross-modal alignment. To address this, we propose two strategies: (1) an exponential moving average (EMA)-guided pseudo supervision framework that generates reliable segment-level masks via adaptive thresholds or top-k selection, offering stable temporal guidance beyond video-level labels; and (2) a class-aware cross-modal agreement (CMA) loss that aligns audio and visual embeddings at reliable segment-class pairs, ensuring consistency across modalities while preserving temporal structure. Evaluations on LLP and UnAV-100 datasets shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>EEmo-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models on Image Evoked Emotion Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16405v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The furnishing of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has led to the emergence of numerous benchmark studies, particularly those evaluating their perception and understanding capabilities. Among these, understanding image-evoked emotions aims to enhance MLLMs' empathy, with significant applications such as human-machine interaction and advertising recommendations. However, current evaluations of this MLLM capability remain coarse-grained, and a systematic and comprehensive assessment is still lacking. To this end, we introduce EEmo-Bench, a novel benchmark dedicated to the analysis of the evoked emotions in images across diverse content categories. Our core contributions include: 1) Regarding the diversity of the evoked emotions, we adopt an emotion ranking strategy and employ the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) as emotional attributes for emotional assessment. In line with this methodology, 1,960 images are collected and manually annotated. 2) We design four tasks to evaluate MLLMs' ability to capture the evoked emotions by single images and their associated attributes: Perception, Ranking, Description, and Assessment. Additionally, image-pairwise analysis is introduced to investigate the model's proficiency in performing joint and comparative analysis. In total, we collect 6,773 question-answer pairs and perform a thorough assessment on 19 commonly-used MLLMs. The results indicate that while some proprietary and large-scale open-source MLLMs achieve promising overall performance, the analytical capabilities in certain evaluation dimensions remain suboptimal. Our EEmo-Bench paves the path for further research aimed at enhancing the comprehensive perceiving and understanding capabilities of MLLMs concerning image-evoked emotions, which is crucial for machine-centric emotion perception and understanding.</description>

      <title>Music2Palette: Emotion-aligned Color Palette Generation via Cross-Modal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion alignment between music and palettes is crucial for effective multimedia content, yet misalignment creates confusion that weakens the intended message. However, existing methods often generate only a single dominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings through text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To address these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for emotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation learning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated music-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly translate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a multi-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment, color diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and generating attractive and diverse color palettes. Our approach enables applications like music-driven image recoloring, video generating, and data visualization, bridging the gap between auditory and visual emotion experiences.</description>

      <title>Video-Foley: Two-Stage Video-To-Sound Generation via Temporal Event Condition For Foley Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor alignment and controllability, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope closely related to audio semantics, acts as a temporal event feature to guide audio generation from video. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Source code, model weights and demos are available on our companion website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)</description>

      <title>MAVL: A Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Dataset for Animated Song Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.</description>
