      <title>Quantum Field Measurements in the Fewster-Verch Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fewster-Verch (FV) framework was introduced as a prescription to define local operations within a quantum field theory (QFT) that are free from Sorkin-like causal paradoxes. In this framework the measurement device is modeled via a probe QFT that, after interacting with the target QFT, is subject to an arbitrary local measurement. While the FV framework is rich enough to carry out quantum state tomography, it has two drawbacks. First, it is unclear if the FV framework allows conducting arbitrary local measurements. Second, if the probe field is interpreted as physical and the FV framework as fundamental, then one must demand the probe measurement to be itself implementable within the framework. That would involve a new probe, which should also be subject to an FV measurement, and so on. It is unknown if there exist non-trivial FV measurements for which such an "FV-Heisenberg cut" can be moved arbitrarily far away. In this work, we advance the first problem by proving that measurements of locally smeared fields fit within the FV framework. We solve the second problem by showing that any such field measurement admits a movable FV-Heisenberg cut.</description>

      <title>Soft gravitons in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum gravity with zero cosmological constant in three dimensions. First, we show that pure quantum gravity can be written as a magnetic Carrollian theory living on null infinity, described by Schwarzian-like degrees of freedom. Next, we couple quantum gravity to massless matter. Transition amplitudes exhibit several features that resemble soft graviton physics in four dimensions, despite the absence of a propagating graviton. As in four dimensions, we find three equivalent results: a soft graviton theorem, an infinite-dimensional BMS asymptotic symmetry, and a gravitational memory effect. We also resolve some extant puzzles concerning the partition function and Hilbert space of pure 3d gravity with zero cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators at the Loop Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode rich information about physics at the Hubble scale and may exhibit characteristic oscillatory signals due to the exchange of massive particles. Although many 1-loop processes, especially those that break de Sitter (dS) boosts, can generate significant leading signals for various particle models in cosmological collider physics, the precise results for these correlators or their full signals remain unknown due to the lack of symmetry. In this work, we apply the method of partial Mellin-Barnes (PMB) representation to the calculation of cosmological correlators at the loop level. As a first step, we use the PMB representation to calculate four-point cosmological correlators with bubble topology. We find that both the nonlocal and local signals arise from the factorized part, validating the cutting rules proposed in previous work, and are free from UV divergence. Furthermore, the UV divergence originates solely from the background piece and can be manifestly canceled by introducing the appropriate counterterm, similar to the procedure in flat spacetime. We also demonstrate how to renormalize the 1-loop correlators in Mellin space. After a consistency check with known results for the covariant case, we provide new analytical results for the signals generated from a nontrivial dS-boost-breaking bubble.</description>

      <title>Leading Higher Derivative Corrections to Multipole Moments of Kerr-Newman Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the (leading) 4-derivative corrections, including both parity even and odd terms, to electrically-charged Kerr-Newman black holes. The linear perturbative equations are then solved order by order in terms of two dimensionless rotating and charge parameters. The solution allows us to extract the multipole moments of mass and current from the metric as well as the electric and magnetic multipole moments from the Maxwell field. We find that all the multipole moments are invariant under the field redefinition, indicating they are well-defined physical observables in this effective theory approach to quantum gravity. We also find that parity-odd corrections can turn on the multipole moments that vanish in Einstein theory, which may have significant observational implications.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering in Ising Field Theory using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scattering in Ising Field Theory (IFT) using matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. IFT is a one-parameter family of strongly coupled non-integrable quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions, interpolating between massive free fermion theory and Zamolodchikov's integrable massive $E_8$ theory. Particles in IFT may scatter either elastically or inelastically. In the post-collision wavefunction, particle tracks from all final-state channels occur in superposition; processes of interest can be isolated by projecting the wavefunction onto definite particle sectors, or by evaluating energy density correlation functions. Using numerical simulations we determine the time delay of elastic scattering and the probability of inelastic particle production as a function of collision energy. We also study the mass and width of the lightest resonance near the $E_8$ point in detail. Close to both the free fermion and $E_8$ theories, our results for both elastic and inelastic scattering are in good agreement with expectations from form-factor perturbation theory. Using numerical computations to go beyond the regime accessible by perturbation theory, we find that the high energy behavior of the two-to-two particle scattering probability in IFT is consistent with a conjecture of Zamolodchikov. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of tensor-network methods for simulating the real-time dynamics of strongly coupled quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>CFTs with Large Gap from Barnes-Wall Lattice Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate orbifolds of lattice conformal field theories with the goal of constructing theories with large gap. We consider Barnes-Wall lattices, which are a family of lattices with no short vectors, and orbifold by an extraspecial 2-group of lattice automorphisms. To construct the orbifold CFT, we investigate the orbifold vertex operator algebra and its twisted modules. To obtain a holomorphic CFT, a certain anomaly 3-cocycle $\omega$ needs to vanish; based on evidence we provide, we conjecture that it indeed does. Granting this conjecture, we construct a holomorphic CFT of central charge 128 with gap 4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of soft limits to (Anti) de Sitter spaces, investigating the analytic structure of holographic gluon correlators as part of a broader effort to reveal new symmetries and fundamental structures in gauge theories. By reorganizing perturbation theory in AdS to align with flat space unitarity, we analyze the contributions intrinsic to curved spacetime and their behavior in the soft limit. Our analysis uncovers schematic relations between $(n+1)$-point amplitude and $n$-point transition amplitudes in arbitrary-dimensional AdS, with explicit results derived for $n=4$ in AdS$_{d+1}$.</description>

      <title>Topologically charged BPS microstates in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard $\mathcal{N}=(4,4)$ AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ with $\mathrm{sym}^N(T^4)$, as well as the $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Datta-Eberhardt-Gaberdiel variant with $\mathrm{sym}^N(T^4/\mathbb{Z}_2)$, supersymmetric index techniques have not been applied so far to the CFT states with target-space momentum or winding. We clarify that the difficulty lies in a central extension of the SUSY algebra in the momentum and winding sectors, analogous to the central extension on the Coulomb branch of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories. We define modified helicity-trace indices tailored to the momentum and winding sectors, and use them for microstate counting of the corresponding bulk black holes. In the $\mathcal{N}=(4,4)$ case we reproduce the microstate matching of Larsen and Martinec. In the $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ case we resolve a previous mismatch with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula encountered in the topologically trivial sector by going to certain winding sectors.</description>

      <title>Rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ruijsenaars-Schneider models are integrable dynamical realizations of the Poincare group in 1+1 dimensions, which reduce to the Calogero and Sutherland systems in the nonrelativistic limit. In this work, a possibility to construct a one-parameter deformation of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider models by uplifting the Poincare algebra in 1+1 dimensions to the anti de Sitter algebra is studied. It is shown that amendments including a cosmological constant are feasible for the rational variant, while the hyperbolic and trigonometric systems are ruled out by our analysis. The issue of integrability of the deformed rational model is discussed in some detail. A complete proof of integrability remains a challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the higher-spin gauge models which are free on-shell and whose cubic vertex is BRST-exact. We show that these are free off-shell as well as on-shell. The key equation for this relates the derivative of the total deformed action $S(g)$ with respect to the deformation parameter $g$ to an $S(g)$-exact term.</description>

      <title>One Loop Thermal Effective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the one loop effective action for a Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, in the presence of background gauge fields, employing the Heat-Kernel method. This method enables us to compute the thermal corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with effective operators up to arbitrary mass dimension, which emerge after integrating out heavy scalars and fermions from a generic UV theory. The Heat-Kernel coefficients are functions of non-zero background `electric', `magnetic' fields, and Polyakov loops. A major application of our formalism is the calculation of the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potentials in effective theories, necessary for the study of phase transitions. A novel feature of this work is the systematic calculation of the dependence of Polyakov loops on the thermal factors of Heat-Kernel coefficients and the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We study the effect of Polyakov loop factors on phase transitions and comment on future directions in applications of the results derived in this work.</description>

      <title>Chalykh's Baker-Akhiezer functions as eigenfunctions of the integer-ray integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macdonald symmetric polynomial at $t=q^{-m}$ reduces to a sum of much simpler complementary non-symmetric polynomials, which satisfy a simple system of the first order linear difference equations with constant coefficients, much simpler than those induced by the usual Ruijsenaars Hamiltonians of the cut-and-join type. We provide examples of explicit expressions for these polynomials nicknamed Baker-Akhiezer functions (BAF), and demonstrate that they further decompose into sums of nicely factorized quantities, perhaps, non-uniquely. Equations and solutions can be easily continued to non-integer parameters $\lambda$, which, in Macdonald polynomial case, are associated with integer partitions. Moreover, there is a straightforward generalization to "twisted" BAF's, which, however, are not so easy to decompose, and factorization of the coefficients is lost, at least naively. Still, these twisted BAF's provide eigenfunctions for Hamiltonians associated with commutative integer ray subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra.</description>

Abstract: We consider $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal gauge theories in four dimensions. We explain how these quiver gauge theories arise as low-energy worldvolume theories of D3-branes on orientifolds. Then, we examine their associated chiral algebras, and propose novel examples of twisted holographic dualities arising in the large-N limit. These dualities involve topological strings in the bulk, which is a Calabi-Yau threefold taking the form $\text{SL}_2 \mathbb{C} / \Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I report the recent advances in applying (graded) Hopf algebras with braided tensor product in two scenarios: i) paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions living in any space dimensions and transforming under the permutation group; ii) physical models of anyons living in two space-dimensions and transforming under the braid group. In the first scenario simple toy models based on the so-called $2$-bit parastatistics show that, in the multiparticle sector, certain observables can discriminate paraparticles from ordinary bosons/fermions (thus, providing a counterexample to the widespread belief of the "conventionality of parastatistics" argument). In the second scenario the notion of (braided) Majorana qubit is introduced as the simplest building block to implement the Kitaev's proposal of a topological quantum computer which protects from decoherence.</description>

Abstract: We propose a modification of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model, formulated on a supersymmetric extension of three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter $\left(AdS_{3}\right)$ space. This model holographically reproduces the tree-level maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) celestial amplitudes for gravitons in $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity and gluons in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory.</description>

      <title>Peierls substitution and Hall motion in exotic Carroll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle with first-order dynamics proposed by Dunne, Jackiw and Trugenberger (DJT) to justify the "Peierls substitution" is obtained by reduction from both of two-parameter centrally extended Galilean and Carroll systems. In the latter case the extension parameters $\kappa_{exo}$ and $\kappa_{mag}$ generate non-commutativity of the coordinates resp. behave as an internal magnetic field. The position and momentum follow uncoupled anomalous Hall motions. Consistently with partial immobility, one of the Carroll boost generators is broken but the other remains a symmetry. Switching off $\kappa_{exo}$, the immobility of unextended Carroll particles is recovered. The Carroll system is dual to an uncharged anyon on the horizon of a black hole which exhibits the spin-Hall effect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss what topological data must be provided to define topologically twisted partition functions of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric field theories. The original example of Donaldson-Witten theory depends only on the diffeomorphism type of the spacetime and 't Hooft fluxes (characteristic classes of background gerbe connections, a.k.a. "one-form symmetry connections.") The example of $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theories shows that, in general, the twisted partition functions depend on further topological data. We describe topological twisting for general four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and argue that the topological partition functions depend on (a): the diffeomorphism type of the spacetime, (b): the characteristic classes of background gerbe connections and (c): a "generalized spin-c structure," a concept we introduce and define. The main ideas are illustrated with both Lagrangian theories and class $\mathcal{S}$ theories. In the case of class $\mathcal{S}$ theories of $A_1$ type, we note that the different $S$-duality orbits of a theory associated with a fixed UV curve $C_{g,n}$ can have different topological data.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Chiral-Gravitational Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze causality and unitarity constraints in graviton scattering amplitudes, aiming to establish new bounds on theories with $U(1)$-gravitational anomalies, such as axion models or strongly-coupled gauge theories. For this purpose, we show the necessity of coupling these theories to gravity. We obtain a universal scale $\Lambda_{\rm caus}$ at which states with $J\geq 4$ must appear in the theory. We show that this scale can lie below the quantum gravity scale. For axion models, we get $\Lambda_{\rm caus}\sim\sqrt{M_P f_a}$ where $f_a$ is the axion decay constant. In strongly-coupled gauge theories in the large-$N_c$ limit, the presence of glueballs allows to evade these bounds, provided the number of fermions $N_F\ll N_c$ and the 'tHooft coupling is not large. Nevertheless, for models that have a holographic 5D dual (large 'tHooft coupling), $\Lambda_{\rm caus}$ emerges as a new cutoff scale, unless certain conditions on the parameters of the 5D models are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group flow of projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity in (3+1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive numerical study of the renormalization group flow of marginal couplings in $(3+1)$-dimensional projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity. First, we classify all fixed points of the flow and analyze their stability matrices. We find that some of the stability matrices possess complex eigenvalues and discuss why this does not contradict unitarity. Next, we scan over the renormalization group trajectories emanating from all asymptotically free fixed points. We identify a unique fixed point giving rise to a set of trajectories spanning the whole range of the kinetic coupling $\lambda$ compatible with unitarity. This includes the region $0&lt;\lambda-1\ll 1$ assumed in previous phenomenological applications. The respective trajectories closely follow a single universal trajectory, differing only by the running of the gravitational coupling. The latter exhibits non-monotonic behavior along the flow, vanishing both in the ultraviolet and the infrared limits. The requirement that the theory remains weakly coupled along the renormalization group trajectory implies a natural hierarchy between the scale of Lorentz invariance violation and a much larger value of the Planck mass inferred from low-energy interactions.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations, we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant {\it only} if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>Certain BCS wavefunctions are quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a method for constructing many-body scar states in fermionic lattice models that incorporate a given type of correlations with one of the states maximizing them over the full Hilbert space. Therefore this state may always be made the ground state by adding such correlations as a "pairing potential" $\delta H_0$ to any Hamiltonian $H=H_0+OT$ supporting group-invariant scars [arXiv:2007.00845]. In case of single-flavour spin-full fermions the ground state is a special case of the BCS wavefunction written in real space and invariant under any site index relabelling. For multi-orbital fermions this state also resembles BCS but includes higher order terms corresponding to "pairing" of more than two fermions. The broad class of eligible Hamiltonians $H$ is well documented [arXiv:2007.00845],[arXiv:2106.10300] and includes many conventional condensed matter interactions. The part of the Hamiltonian $(H_0+\delta H_0)$ that governs the exact dynamics of the scar subspace coincides with the BCS mean-field Hamiltonian. We therefore show that its BCS ground state and the excitations above it are many-body scars that are dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space and thereby protected from thermalization. These states are insensitive to a variety of $OT$ Hamiltonian terms that among others include interactions and (spin-orbit) hoppings. Our results point out a connection between the fields of superconductivity and weak ergodicity breaking (many-body scars) and will hopefully encourage further investigations. They also provide the first practical protocol to initialize a fermionic system to a scar state in (a quantum simulator) experiment.</description>

      <title>A critical state under weak measurement is not critical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical systems host nontrivial entanglement structure that is generally sensitive to additional couplings. In the present work, we study the effect of weak measurements on the entanglement Hamiltonian of massless free fermions which are prepared in their critical ground state. While the power-law decaying correlation and logarithmic growing entanglement entropy have been observed as typical signatures of quantum criticality after the weak measurement, in this work we show that the conformal symmetry is lost and the entanglement Hamiltonian generally becomes gapped for arbitrary small measurement strength. To reveal this unconventional entanglement structure, we consider a field-theory description that allows us to establish an analytic mapping between the entanglement Hamiltonians before and after the weak measurements. From this mapping, we find that although the measurements lead to a significant modification of the entanglement spectrum, the real-space distribution of the eigenfunction of the kernel of entanglement Hamiltonian is unchanged, which is responsible for the coexistence of a gapped entanglement Hamiltonian and the logarithmic entanglement entropy. Moreover, as the mapping works for arbitrarily many disjoint intervals, the multi-interval entanglement entropy also exhibits the same scaling behavior as the critical ground state, and shares the same effective central charge with the single-interval case. We numerically demonstrate these field-theory results on a lattice model, where the entanglement Hamiltonian after weak measurements exhibits the typical signature of a finite gap and becomes long-ranged even in the single-interval case. This is distinct from the critical ground state, where the entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval is gapless and local.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of non-violent non-locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can give precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third generation network.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a wavefunction of the universe, which correspond to an Euclidean charged wineglass (half)-wormholes semiclassically, as a possible creation for our inflationary universe. We calculate the Euclidean action of the charged wormhole, and find that the initial state of universe brought by such an Euclidean charged wormhole can exhibit a high probability weight for a long period of inflation. We compare our result with that of axion wormholes, and evaluate the potential of other corresponding Euclidean configurations as the pre-inflationary initial states.</description>

      <title>Effective actions, cutoff regularization, quasi-locality, and gluing of partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies a regularization of the quantum (effective) action for a scalar field theory in a general position on a compact smooth Riemannian manifold. As the main method, we propose the use of a special averaging operator, which leads to a quasi-locality and is a natural generalization of a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation in the case of a curved metric. It is proved that the regularization method is consistent with a process of gluing of manifolds and partition functions, that is, with the transition from submanifolds to the main manifold using an additional functional integration. It is shown that the method extends to other models, and is also consistent with the process of multiplicative renormalization. Additionally, we discuss issues related to the correct introduction of regularization and the locality.</description>

Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the Einstein equation on homogeneous supermanifolds. First, we produce explicit curvature formulas for graded Riemannian metrics on these spaces. Next, we present a construction of homogeneous supermanifolds by means of Dynkin diagrams, resembling the construction of generalised flag manifolds in classical (non-super) theory. We describe the Einstein metrics on several classes of spaces obtained through this approach. Our results provide examples of compact homogeneous supermanifolds on which the Einstein equation has no solutions, discrete families of solutions, and continuous families of Ricci-flat solutions among invariant metrics. These examples demonstrate that the finiteness conjecture from classical homogeneous geometry fails on supermanifolds, and challenge the intuition furnished by Bochner's vanishing theorem.</description>

      <title>Charged Fuzzy Dark Matter Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) characterized by a spherical charge distribution. This work introduces a new class of spherically symmetric, self-gravitational relativistic charged models for FDM haloes, using the Einasto density model. This study enables the dark matter (DM) to appear as the matter ingredient, which constructs the black hole and extends the non-commutative mini black hole stellar solutions. By considering the charged anisotropic energy-momentum tensor with an equation of state (EoS) $p_{r}=-\rho$, we explore various black hole solutions for different values of the Einasto index and mass parameter. Our approach suggests that the central density of the resulting black hole model mimics the usual de Sitter core. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of constructing a charged self-gravitational droplet by replacing the above-mentioned EoS with a non-local one. However, under these circumstances, the radial pressure is observed to be negative. Ultimately, we consider various possibilities of constructing DM black holes, featuring intermediate masses that could evolve into galaxies. Consequently, some of these theoretical models have the potential to replace the usual black hole solutions of the galactic core. Simultaneously, these models are physically beneficial for being comprised of the fundamental matter component of the cosmos. Due to the outcomes of this paper, we would be able to study the connection between BH and DM by formulating stable stellar structures featuring fuzzy mass distributions derived from the Einasto distribution of DM halos.</description>

Abstract: Asymptotic properties of classical field electrodynamics are considered. Special attention is paid to the long-range structure of the electromagnetic field. It is shown that conserved Poincare quantities may be expressed in terms of the asymptotic fields. Long-range variables are shown to be responsible for an angular momentum contribution which mixes Coulomb and infrared free field characteristics; otherwise angular momentum and energy-momentum separate into electromagnetic and matter fields contributions.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Buchdahl's limit: A surgeon's guide to compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the theoretical motivations behind the belief that black holes as described by general relativity exist in nature is that it is hard to find matter configurations that mimic their properties, especially their compactness. One of the classic results that goes in this direction is the so-called Buchdahl limit: a bound for the maximum compactness that, under a few assumptions, static fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium can possibly have. We highlight two of the main assumptions that could be violated in physically realistic situations: i) isotropy and ii) an outward-decreasing monotonicity of the density profile, which, as we discuss in detail, can be understood as a form of energy condition. We construct a pair of toy models that exemplify how the Buchdahl limit can be overcome if any of these two assumptions is individually relaxed. In particular, we show that relaxing the monotonicity assumption alone yields a new, less restrictive compactness limit as long as the energy density is not allowed to become negative. If negative energies are permitted, the compactness of these toy models can be as close to the black hole limit as desired. We also discuss how these toy models represent some of the main features of realistic systems, and how they could be extended to find more refined models.</description>

Abstract: In this talk we will report on a study of the $\theta$-dependence of the string tension and of the mass gap of four-dimensional SU($N$) Yang--Mills theories. The spectrum at $N=3$ and $N=6$ was obtained on the lattice at various imaginary values of the $\theta$-parameter, using Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions to avoid topological freezing at fine lattice spacings. The coefficient of the $\mathcal{O}(\theta^2)$ term in the Taylor expansion of the spectrum around $\theta=0$ could be obtained in the continuum limit for $N=3$, and on two fairly fine lattices for $N=6$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Effective Field Theories and Black Hole Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This PhD thesis is submitted to arXiv as a pedagogical resource on gravitational effective field theories and the laws of black hole mechanics. It begins with an introduction to the mathematics and intuition behind effective field theory (EFT) corrections to General Relativity (GR) pitched at the level of a first year postgraduate course. Chapter 3 contains a similarly accessible discussion of the laws of black hole mechanics, their derivation in GR, and why they are a particularly interesting setting in which to apply EFT.
  The novel research is contained in Chapters 2 and 4-7. The first of these studies the well-posedness of gravitational EFTs. Specifically, we show that a "modified harmonic" gauge produces a strongly hyperbolic formulation of the leading order Einstein-Maxwell EFT so long as the higher derivative terms are small. The latter Chapters are concerned with proving the validity of the laws of black hole mechanics in EFTs of gravity and broad classes of matter fields. We demonstrate that the zeroth law can be proved for EFTs of gravity, electromagnetism and a charged or uncharged scalar field. We find we must modify the statements of the first and second laws by generalizing the formula of black hole entropy from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy used in GR. For stationary black holes, the Wald entropy is a sufficient definition to satisfy the first law in EFT. For dynamical black holes we show that with further corrections we can prove a non-perturbative second law. We discuss the gauge dependence of this definition of dynamical black hole entropy and provide explicit constructions for specific EFTs.</description>

      <title>From classical probability densities to quantum states: quantization of Gaussian for arbitrary orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary focus of this work is to investigate how the most emblematic classical probability density, namely a Gaussian, can be mapped to a valid quantum states. To explore this issue, we consider a Gaussian whose squared variance depends on a parameter $\lambda$. Specifically, depending on the value of $\lambda$, we study what happens in the classical-quantum correspondence as we change the indeterminacy of the classical particle. Furthermore, finding a correspondence between a classical state and a quantum state is not a trivial task. Quantum observables, described by Hermitian operators, do not generally commute, so a precise ordering must be introduced to resolve this ambiguity. In this work, we study two different arbitrary orderings: the first is an arbitrary ordering of the position and momentum observables; the second, which is the main focus of the present work, is an arbitrary ordering of the annihilation and creation operators. In this latter case, we find the interesting result that even a $\delta$-function, which in general has no quantum correspondence, can be mapped into a valid quantum state for a particular ordering, specifically the antinormal one (all creation operators are to the right of all annihilation operators in the product). This means that the Gaussian probability density corresponds to a valid quantum state, regardless of how localized classical particles are in phase space.</description>

      <title>Investigating the universality of five-point QCD scattering amplitudes at high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $2 \to 3$ QCD scattering amplitudes in multi-Regge kinematics, i.e. where the final partons are strongly ordered in rapidity. In this regime amplitudes exhibit intriguing factorisation properties which can be understood in terms of effective degrees of freedom called \emph{reggeons}. Working within the Balitsky/JIMWLK framework, we predict these amplitudes for the first time to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order, and compare against the limit of QCD scattering amplitudes in full colour and kinematics. We find that the latter can be described in terms of universal objects, and that the apparent non-universality arising at NNLL comes from well-defined and under-control contributions that we can predict. Thanks to this observation, we extract for the first time the universal vertex that controls the emission of the central-rapidity gluon, both in QCD and $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter halo profiles with multi-band observations of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the potential of multiband gravitational wave observations to constrain the properties of static dark matter spikes around intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The influence of dark matter on the orbital evolution of the compact binary is incorporated as a correction to the inspiral Newtonian gravitational waveform. We show that the observations from the proposed space-based detector GWSat, sensitive within the deci-Hz frequency band, when combined with that of the third-generation ground-based detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will produce significantly improved error estimates for all parameters. In particular, our results demonstrate that the joint multiband approach substantially refines the bounds on the dark matter spike parameters-namely, the power-law index and spike density-by factors of approximately $10^6$ and $10^3$, respectively, compared to observations employing only third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Is there any Trinity of Gravity, to start with?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric trinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity equations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead of curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita connection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing but an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of having a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve any additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same time, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In particular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet another parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of modifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in GR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same physics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical inventions. For sure, one can always safely create novel constructions which do not influence the physical equations of motion, but in itself it does not make much sense and blatantly goes against the Occam's razor.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Singularity as a Thermodynamic System being the Seat of BH Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue in this paper that the entropy of the BH is located in the BH singularity and that the localization around the event horizon is perhaps a secondary effect. We show in particular that the dependence of the entropy located in the singularity is also proportional to $M^2$. We furthermore show that our analysis leads in a natural way to information loss as the micro structure of the BH singularity is of a completely different character compared to ordinary quantum space time underlying our classical space time manifold.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of the L\'evy-Leblond Spinors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first-order L\'evy-Leblond differential equations (LLEs) are the non-relativistic analogous of the Dirac equation: they are the "square roots" of the Schr\"odinger equation in ($1+d$) dimensions and admit spinor solutions. In this paper we show how to extend to the L\'evy-Leblond spinors the real/complex/quaternionic classification of the relativistic spinors (which leads to the notions of Dirac, Weyl, Majorana, Majorana-Weyl, Quaternionic spinors). Besides the free equations, we also consider the presence of potential terms. Applied to a conformal potential, the simplest $(1+1)$-dimensional LLE induces a new differential realization of the $osp(1|2)$ superalgebra in terms of differential operators depending on the time and space coordinates.</description>

      <title>Dark universe inspired by the Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in unifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with massive spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). By assuming a minimal coupling between the self-interacting scalar field and the gauge field, a "mass" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. We draw an analogy with superconductivity theory, where the condensation of a scalar field results in the emergence of massive spin-1 particles producing repulsive forces, along with an increase of the gravitational force due the correction to Newton's constant. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures from reheating in Chern-Simons running-vacuum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of a Chern-Simons running-vacuum-model (RVM) cosmology, one expects an early-matter dominated (eMD) reheating period after RVM inflation driven by the axion field. Treating thus in this work Chern-Simons RVM cosmology as an effective $f(R)$ gravity theory characterized by logarithmic corrections of the spacetime curvature, we study the gravitational-wave (GW) signal induced by the nearly-scale invariant inflationary adiabatic curvature perturbations during the transition from the eMD era driven by the axion to the late radiation-dominated era. Remarkably, by accounting for the extra GW scalaron polarization present within $f(R)$ gravity theories, we find regions in the parameter space of the theory where one is met with a distinctive induced GW signal with a universal $f^6$ high-frequency scaling compared to the $f^7$ scaling present in general relativity (GR). Interestingly enough, for axion masses $m_a$ higher than 1 GeV and axion gauge couplings $f_a$ above $10^{-3}$ Planck mass, one can produce induced GW spectra within the sensitivity bands of future GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the Big Bang Observer (BBO) and the Square Kilometer Arrays (SKA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article summarizes our recent efforts to understand spontaneous quantum vacuum forces and torques, which require that a stationary object be out of thermal equilibrium with the blackbody background radiation. We proceed by a systematic expansion in powers of the electric susceptibility. In first order, no spontaneous force can arise, although a torque can appear, but only if the body is composed of nonreciprocal material. In second order, both forces and torques can appear, with ordinary materials, but only if the body is inhomogeneous. In higher orders, this last requirement may be removed. We give a number of examples of bodies displaying second-order spontaneous forces and torques, some of which might be amenable to observation.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Flavour Waves Through the Quantum Vacuum: A Theory of Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for neutrino oscillations, in which the flavour neutrinos are treated as waves of massless particles propagating in a "refractive quantum vacuum" and obeying a relativistically covariant equation of motion. The difference in strength between weak interactions and mass-generating interactions is argued to allow for the production and detection of flavour neutrinos in weak interactions as massless particles. They experience the mass-generating interactions as coherent forward scattering in the Brout-Englert-Higgs vacuum, which induces macroscopically multi-refringent effects. The flavour neutrino wave is then found to have a universal effective refractive mass in vacuum and a unique group velocity for a given energy. The coherence of the wave is manifest throughout and, at every moment of the propagation, the energy of the waves is the same. The standard oscillation probability in vacuum is obtained and the effects of matter are incorporated in a natural way.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity from Weyl connection and the $f(R,\cal{A})$ extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Weyl connection and Weyl geometry in order to construct novel modified gravitational theories. In the simplest case where one uses only the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar as a Lagrangian, the theory recovers general relativity. However, by upgrading the Weyl field to a dynamical field with a general potential and/or general couplings constructed from its trace, leads to new modified gravity theories, where the extra degree of freedom is the Weyl field. Additionally, since the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar differs from the Levi-Civita Ricci scalar by terms up to first derivatives of the Weyl field, the resulting field equations for both the metric and the Weyl field are of second order, and thus the theory is free from Ostrogradsky ghosts. Finally, we construct the most general theory, namely the $f(\tilde{R},\cal{A})$ gravity, which is also ghost free and has $2+2$ degrees of freedom. Applying the above classes of theories at a cosmological framework we obtain an effective dark energy sector of geometrical origin. In the simplest class of theories we are able to obtain an effective cosmological constant, and thus we recover $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, nevertheless in more general cases we acquire a dynamical dark energy. These theories can reproduce the thermal history of the Universe, and the corresponding dark energy equation-of-state parameter presents a rich behavior.</description>

As an example of a developed technique we explicitly provide all Jacobi diagrams lying in the kernel of $\mathfrak{sl}_N$ weight system at low orders. We also discuss consequences of the presence of the kernel in Lie algebra weight systems for detection of correlators in the 3D Chern-Simons topological field theory and for distinguishing of knots by the corresponding quantum knot invariants.</description>

Abstract: We point out that some questions in quantum field theory are undecidable in a precise mathematical sense. More concretely, it will be demonstrated that there is no algorithm answering whether a given 2d supersymmetric Lagrangian theory breaks supersymmetry or not. It will also be shown that there is a specific 2d supersymmetric Lagrangian theory which breaks supersymmetry if and only if the standard Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice is consistent, which can never be proved or disproved as the consequence of G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem. The article includes a brief and informal introduction to the phenomenon of undecidability and its previous appearances in theoretical physics.</description>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes and frequencies are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian differential operator. They hold crucial significance in the physics of black holes. The analysis of quasinormal modes of black holes in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter geometries plays also a key role in the study of strongly coupled quantum many-body systems via gauge/gravity duality. In contrast to normal Sturm-Liouville operators, the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian (and non-normal) operators generally exhibit instability under small perturbations. This research focuses on the stability analysis of quasinormal frequencies pertaining to asymptotically planar AdS black holes, employing pseudospectrum analysis. Specifically, we concentrate on the pseudospectra of scalar and transverse gauge fields, shedding light on their relevance within the framework of gauge/gravity duality.</description>

      <title>Aspects of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T }$ deformed Schwarzian: From gravity partition function to late-time spectral form factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate different thermodynamic properties of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T}$ deformed Schwarzian theory and its different gravitational perspectives. First, we compute the partition function of $U(1)$ coupled 2D-gravity with fixed chemical potential, obtained from the dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. Then, we compute the partition function of the gravity theory which is the dual to the deformed Schwarzian living on its boundary and study the genus expansion of the one and two-point correlation function of the partition function of the theory. Subsequently, we use the one-point function to compute the "Annealed" and "Quenched" free energy in low-temperature limits and make a qualitative comparison with the undeformed theory. Then, using the two-point function, we compute the Spectral Form Factor of the deformed theory in early and late time. We find a dip and ramp structure in early and late time, respectively. We also get a plateau structure in the $\tau$-scaling limit. Last but not least, we comment on the late-time topology change to give a physical interpretation of the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor for our theory.</description>

      <title>Higher spins and Finsler geometry</title>

Abstract: Finsler geometry is a natural generalization of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry, where the line element is not the square root of a quadratic form but a more general homogeneous function. Parameterizing this in terms of symmetric tensors suggests a possible interpretation in terms of higher-spin fields. We will see here that, at linear level in these fields, the Finsler version of the Ricci tensor leads to the curved-space Fronsdal equation for all spins, plus a Stueckelberg-like coupling. Nonlinear terms can also be systematically analyzed, suggesting a possible interacting structure. No particular choice of spacetime dimension is needed. The Stueckelberg mechanism breaks gauge transformations to a redundancy that does not change the geometry. This creates a serious issue: non-transverse modes are not eliminated, at least for the versions of Finsler dynamics examined in this paper.</description>

      <title>The open string pair production revisited</title>

Abstract: The experimental efforts in testing the QED vacuum properties such as the Schwinger pair production in the presence of a strong electric field have so far not been successful. This raises a potential possibility regarding if the usual QED vacuum picture is a complete one. In this paper, we address this possibility by taking our own (1 + 3)-dimensional world as a visible D3 brane with a nearby (hidden) D3, placed parallel at a separation, in Type IIB superstring theory and by considering an analogous open string pair production process. This setup can be taken as a simplified version of the underlying QED resulting from the particle physics standard model constructed from the intersecting D-branes. We will use this simple setup to demonstrate that the stringy pair production rate in the weak-field limit, though as expected to equal to the corresponding QED rate from the braneworld picture, contains far more important information than the QED one and as such the future detection of the Schwinger pair production can teach us lessons about the existence of extra dimension(s) and a potential source of dark matter among other things.</description>

      <title>On Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up holographic model that provides the dual description of a strongly coupled field theory, in which the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry yields the SO(5)/SO(4) coset relevant to minimal composite-Higgs models. The gravity background is completely regular and smooth, and has an end of space that mimics confinement on the field theory side. We add to the gravity description a set of localised boundary terms, that introduce additional symmetry-breaking effects, capturing those that would result from coupling the dual strongly coupled field theory to an external, weakly coupled sector. Such terms encapsulate the gauging of a subgroup of the global $SO(5)$ symmetry of the dual field theory, as well as additional explicit symmetry-breaking effects. We show how to combine spurions and gauge fixing and how to take the appropriate limits, so as to respect gauge principles and avoid violations of unitarity.
  The interplay of bulk and boundary-localised couplings leads to the breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to either its SO(4) or SO(3) subgroup, via vacuum misalignment. In field theory terms, the model describes the spontaneous breaking of a SO(4) gauge symmetry to its SO(3) subgroup. We expose the implications of the higgsing phenomenon by computing the spectrum of fluctuations of the model, which we interpret in four-dimensional field-theory terms, for a few interesting choices of parameters. We conclude by commenting on the additional steps needed to build a realistic composite Higgs model.</description>

      <title>On equivalence of gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several approaches to formulate gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin fields in $d$ dimensions including the following: (i) in terms of symmetric tensor fields $\phi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, with $k = s, s-1, \dots , 0$, restricted to be double traceless for $k\geq 4$; and (ii) in terms of a quartet of $traceful$ symmetric tensor fields $\psi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, of rank $k=s,s-1,s-2, s-3$. We demonstrate that these formulations in Minkowski space ${\mathbb M}^d$ are equivalent to the gauge-invariant theory for a massive integer-spin field proposed in 1989 by Pashnev. We also make use of the Klishevich-Zinoviev theory in ${\mathbb M}^d$ to derive a unique generalisation of the Singh-Hagen model for a massive integer-spin field in $d&gt;4 $ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The holographic duality (also known as AdS/CFT correspondence or gauge/gravity duality) postulates that strongly coupled quantum field theories can be described in a dual way in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter space. One of the cornerstones of this duality is the description of thermal states as black holes with asymptotically Anti-de Sitter boundary conditions. This idea has led to valuable insights into such fields as transport theory and relativistic hydrodynamics. In this context, the quasinormal modes of such black holes play a decisive role and therefore their stability properties are of upmost interest for the holographic duality. We review recent results using the method of pseudospectra.</description>

      <title>Schwinger vs Coleman: Magnetic Charge Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetic mixing of two U(1) gauge theories can result in a massless photon that has perturbative couplings to both electric and magnetic charges. This framework can be used to perturbatively calculate in a quantum field theory with both kinds of charge. Here we re-examine the running of the magnetic charge, where the calculations of Schwinger and Coleman sharply disagree. We calculate the running of both electric and magnetic couplings and show that the disagreement between Schwinger and Coleman is due to an incomplete summation of topological terms in the perturbation series. We present a momentum space prescription for calculating the loop corrections in which the topological terms can be systematically separated for resummation. Somewhat in the spirit of modern amplitude methods we avoid using a vector potential and use the field strength itself, thereby trading gauge redundancy for the geometric redundancy of Stokes surfaces. The resulting running of the couplings demonstrates that Dirac charge quantization is independent of renormalization scale, as Coleman predicted. As a simple application we also bound the parameter space of magnetically charged states through the experimental measurement of the running of electromagnetic coupling.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole by constructing non-perturbative length and timeshift operators in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We first construct projection operators onto the fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift subspaces using the replica trick. We calculate the densities of state for the length and the timeshift, which are found to be finite. This finiteness implies the discreteness in the spectrum of these quantities. We then construct the non-perturbative length and timeshift operators, and apply them to study the time evolution of the two-sided black hole. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty. In particular, the probability of having the negative timeshift states, which corresponds to the white hole probability, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Hermitian Weyl Double Copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-dual double copy is further explored. In previous work, it has been shown that hyper-Hermitian manifolds also have associated the self-dual gauge theories via Kerr-Schild double copy. The self-dual double copy is generalized in the structure of the kinematic algebra by replacing the area-preserving diffeomorphisms algebra with the diffeomorphisms on a surface algebra. This gave rise to the hyper-Hermitian double copy in the Kerr-Schild approach. In the present article, we further study the hyper-Hermitian case using the Weyl double copy formalism. In particular, we have found solutions within this formalism for different hyper-Hermitian metrics. One of the main features is that there will be two Maxwell spinors and one of them is source-free while the other has a source current. This is compatible with the fact that, in general, the hyper-Hermitian spaces are not Ricci-flat.</description>

Abstract: We construct a soliton train configuration with holographic superfluid model under AdS soliton background. We investigate the stability of a soliton train using Bloch waves under two distinct quantization schemes. Upon imposing a minor perturbation on the soliton train system, it has been observed that there exist two elastic modes and one phonon mode. Most importantly, we find, under soliton train background, that there is a rich phase diagram concerning the chemical potential under standard quantization. Nevertheless, there are no unstable modes under alternative quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the renormalization of scalar mass and point out that the quantum correction to the physical observable, as opposed to the bare parameter, of a renormalizable operator, is technically insensitive to ultraviolet physics and independent of the regularization scheme. It is expressed as the difference in the same quantities at different energy scales, maintaining the same asymptotics. Thus, any sensible regularization cancels out the divergences, including the quadratic ones, and yields the same finite corrections. To this end, we first show that the vacuum polarization of quantum electrodynamics is independent of the regularization scheme and a gauge-dependent quadratic divergence is canceled in the observable. We then calculate the quantum correction to the Higgs mass squared by the top-quark loop. It is again finite and regularization-scheme independent. For large external momentum, the correction of the pole mass-squared is dominated by power running, resulting in an order of 1 percent correction. In particular, the effect of heavy fields on the scalar mass correction is suppressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study physical implications of general CP symmetry including CP-like symmetry. Various scattering amplitudes of CP asymmetry are calculated in CP-like symmetric models. We explicitly show that the CP-like transformation leads to a specific relation between different CP asymmetries. The resultant relation is similar to the one obtained in GUT baryogenesis and sphaleron processes, where we also obtain a required condition for generating particle number asymmetry in CP-like symmetric models. In addition, we propose a generalization of a CP-like transformation for continuous symmetry groups. Since the CP transformation is an outer automorphism, which depends on the internal symmetry group, it turns out that the physical CP and CP-like symmetries can be mutually converted through the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the internal symmetry. We investigate properties of physical CP asymmetry in both CP and CP-like symmetric phases, and find that the spontaneous CP violation and restoration can be observed even in models with continuous groups. We demonstrate that CP-like symmetric models with continuous Lie groups can be naturally realized in physical CP symmetric models through the SSB.</description>

      <title>Theories Without Models: Uncontrolled Idealizations in Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perturbative treatment of realistic quantum field theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, requires the use of mathematical idealizations in the approximation series for scattering amplitudes. Such mathematical idealisations are necessary to derive empirically relevant models from the theory. Mathematical idealizations can be either controlled or uncontrolled, depending on whether current scientific knowledge can explain whether the effects of the idealization are negligible or not. Drawing upon negative formal results in asymptotic analysis (failure of Borel summability) and renormalization group theory (failure of asymptotic safety), we argue that the mathematical idealizations applied in perturbative quantum electrodynamics should be understood as uncontrolled. This, in turn, leads to the problematic conclusion that such theories do not have theoretical models in the standard understanding of this term. The existence of unquestionable empirically successful theories without theoretical models has significant implications both for our understanding of the theory-model relationship in physics and the concept of empirical adequacy.</description>

      <title>Identifying gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems by Biorthogonal Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gap-closings in one- and two-dimensional tight-binding models with two bands, containing non-Hermitian hopping terms, and open boundary conditions (OBCs) imposed along one direction. We compare the bulk OBC spectra with the periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra, pointing out that they do not coincide, which is an intrinsic characteristic of non-Hermitian systems. The non-Hermiticity, thus, results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously. We elucidate the behaviour of two possible candidates applicable for one-dimensional slices - (1) the sum of winding numbers for the two bands defined on a generalized Brillouin zone and (2) the biorthogonal polarization (BP). While the former shows jumps/discontinuities for some of the non-Hermitian systems studied here, at points when an edge mode enters the bulk states and becomes delocalized, it does not maintain quantized values in a given topological phase. On the contrary, BP shows jumps at phase transitions, and takes the quantized value of one or zero, which corresponds to whether an actual edge mode exists or whether that mode is delocalized and absorbed within the bulk (not being an edge mode anymore).</description>

Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum mechanics was originally formulated to describe particles. Using ideas from the geometric quantization approach, we show how the concept of antiparticles can and should be introduced in the non-relativistic case without appealing to quantum field theory. We discuss this in detail using the example of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian formulations of the Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a previously successful discussion of the constrained Schr\"{o}dinger system through the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to the case of the Dirac field. In order to follow the analogy, first we discuss the classical Dirac field as a spinorial variable, by introducing properly defined momenta and a suitably modified, factor ordered Poisson bracket. According to the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm two second class Hamiltonian constraints emerge, leading to a factor ordered Dirac bracket on the full phase space. This becomes the Poisson bracket on the reduced phase space in the canonical chart adapted to the shell. The Dirac equation is recovered both as consistency condition on the full phase space and as canonical equation on the reduced phase space. Alternatively, considering the Dirac field as odd Grassmann variable, we present the details of the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm (with either left and righ derivatives acting on Grassmann valued superfunctions and involving a different type of generalized Poisson and Dirac brackets). We propose a recipe for the canonical second quantization of all three versions of the generalized Dirac brackets, yielding the correct fundamental anticommutator.</description>

      <title>Premerger phenomena in neutron-star binary coalescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity from number density current in (non)equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) serve as comprehensive probes into our early Universe with associated generations of stochastic gravitational waves and superhorizon curvature perturbations or even primordial black holes. In characterizing the FOPT, phenomenological parameters like transition temperatures, strength factors, bubble separations, and energy budgets can be easily extracted from the macroscopic equilibrium features of the underlying particle physics models except for the terminal wall velocity of the bubble expansion, making it the last key parameter to be determined most difficultly due to the non-equilibrium nature of the microscopic transition model. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent approach to calculate the bubble wall velocity by virtue of an extra junction condition from the conservation and violation of the total number density current across the shock front (if any) and bubble wall, respectively.</description>

      <title>Universal time evolution of string order parameter in quantum critical systems with boundary invertible or non-invertible symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global symmetry, either invertible or non-invertible, has been extensively studied in two dimensional conformal field theories in recent years. When the theory is defined on a manifold with open boundaries, however, many interesting conformal boundary conditions will fully or partially break such global symmetry. In this work, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking boundaries or interfaces when the system is out of equilibrium. We show that the boundary or interface symmetry-breaking can be detected by the time evolution of string order parameters, which are constructed from the symmetry operators that implement the symmetry transformations. While the string order parameters are independent of time if the symmetry is preserved over the whole system, they evolve in time in a universal way if the boundary or interface breaks the symmetry. More explicitly, in the presence of boundary or interface symmetry-breaking, the string order parameters decay exponentially in time after a global quantum quench, and decay as a power-law in time after a local quantum quench. We also generalize our study to the case when the string order parameters are defined in a subsystem, which are related to the full counting statistics. It is found there are also universal features in the time evolution of string order parameters in this case. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of these two different types of string order parameters in lattice models.</description>

      <title>Crunch from AdS bubble collapse in unbounded potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with a Minkowski false vacuum and an unbounded (or very deep) true vacuum. We show compelling evidence that an AdS bubble of vanishing total energy, embedded in asymptotically flat spacetime, generically undergoes a spherical collapse which leads to a space-like curvature singularity after the formation of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons. The crunch singularity, which is hided behind an apparent horizon, occurs before the true vacuum is reached, and the existence of a lower bound of the scalar field potential is not a necessary condition for its formation.</description>
