      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the shock, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional He+ pickup ion velocity distribution functions observed with STEREO-A PLASTIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freshly injected interstellar Pickup Ions (PUIs) are expected to exhibit a simple, torus-shaped velocity distribution function. The PUI velocity in the solar wind frame depends on the velocity of the interstellar neutral (ISN) population at the pick-up position. In this study, we compare PUI velocity distributions measured by the PLasma And SupraThermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) instrument over the full orbit of Solar TErestrial RElations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) directly. We define a new position-independent velocity measure for PUIs that takes the local direction of the interstellar neutral inflow into account. The resulting new PUI velocity measure corrects thereby for the position-dependent contribution of the ISN velocity. Pitch-angle distributions are then analysed depending on the magnetic-field azimuthal angle for different orbital positions and different values of the PUI velocity measure. The new PUI velocity measure shows an approximately constant cut-off over the complete orbit of STEREO-A. A torus signature is visible everywhere. Therein, a broadening of the torus signature outside the focusing cone and crescent regions and for lower velocity measure observed. In addition, we illustrate the symmetry between the primary and secondary ISN trajectory in the vicinity of the focusing cone. A torus signature associated with freshly injected PUIs is visible over the complete orbit of STEREO-A with increased density in the focusing cone. At least remnants of a torus signature remain for smaller values of the PUI velocity measure. The new velocity measure also prepares for PUI studies with Solar Orbiter.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared Spectral Properties of Type Ib/Ic Supernova Progenitors and Implications for JWST and NGRST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While about 20 Type II supernova progenitors have been identified using optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), direct detection of type Ib/Ic supernova (SN Ib/Ic) progenitors remains challenging due to their faint optical brightness and highly obscured environments. This study aims to investigate the detection limits and advantages of near-infrared (near-IR) observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST) for the detection of SN Ib/Ic progenitors. The spectral energy distributions of SN Ib/Ic progenitor models with various masses, chemical compositions, and mass-loss rates are calculated with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We then assess the detectability of SN Ib/Ic progenitors using near-IR filters from the JWST and the NGRST, comparing the results to the capabilities of the HST. Our analysis indicates that near-IR observations significantly outperform the HST in detecting SN Ib/Ic progenitors when considering the effect of extinction. Near-IR magnitudes also provide better constraints on the mass-loss rates of progenitors because of the free-free emission from the wind matter. Additionally, near-IR magnitudes and color-color diagrams are effective in distinguishing SN Ib/Ic progenitors from possible companion and/or background objects. This study suggests that the JWST and the NGRST can play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of SN Ib/Ic progenitors by improving detectability and offering better constraints on progenitor properties. We emphasize that observations with exposure times exceeding 1 hour would be needed to detect typical SNe Ib/Ic progenitors at distances greater than 10 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the 8 April 2024 Total Solar Eclipse with Multiple Solar Photospheric Magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 8 April 2024 total solar eclipse (TSE) provides a unique opportunity to study the solar corona. This work presents our prediction of the solar corona at the time of the eclipse based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling performed with the Alfv\'{e}n Wave Solar Model-Realtime (AWSoM-R) in the Space Weather Modeling Framework, developed at the University of Michigan. We performed multiple simulations made with data input in the form of synchronic magnetograms from four sources, i.e., ADAPT-GONG, Lockheed Martin ESFAM, HipFT and NSO-NRT magnetograms. Simulations also include a higher-resolution model and a post-eclipse model incorporating newly emerged active regions. Our study fundamentally focuses on the limitations imposed by the lack of global solar observations, particularly on how these limitations affect coronal simulations. Specifically, we examine how differences among the magnetograms and the absence of observations from the east limb, due to the Sun's rotation, impact the accuracy of the predicted coronal structures. We synthesized a variety of representative observables, including the white-light and extreme-ultraviolet images from each model, and compared them with observations. The synthesized observables show remarkable differences because of the distinct magnetic coronal topologies, which stem from the varied magnetic flux distributions and the gaps in observational coverage. Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive and multi-satellite magnetic field observations to improve future solar corona predictions.</description>

      <title>Surface brightness-color relations for red giant branch stars using asteroseismic radii and Gaia distances (the ARD method)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Asteroseismic radius and Gaia distance (ARD) method has been proposed to establish the SBCRs for late-type stars. Methods. We select Kepler RGB stars with high-precision asteroseismic radii (uncertainties &lt; 1%) and cross-match them with 2MASS, APASS, and Gaia to obtain Johnson-B, Johnson-V, G, J, H, and Ks-band photometric data. After applying selection criteria, we obtain 626 RGB stars to build the SBCR. Among these, 100 RGBs are used as independent validation for the distance, and the remaining samples are used to fit the SBCR. Results. First, using 526 targets with asteroseismic radii and Gaia distances, nine SBCRs are proposed based on 2MASS (J, H, Ks), APASS (Johnson-B, Johnson-V), and Gaia (G) photometry. The average rms scatter in these relations is 0.075 mag, which corresponds to an uncertainty of approximately 3.5% in distance. These relations are further validated using 100 independent samples with Gaia distances, showing no bias, with a dispersion of approximately 3%. Compared to interferometric measurements, a systematic underestimation of 2.3% was observed, and the discrepancy decreases as the angular diameter increases. Additionally, the distances of eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using our SBCRs are generally consistent with those measured in the literature, with a dispersion of 1% and a slight overestimation of 1% to 2.5%. Conclusions. The ARD method capitalizes on two key advantages for precise stellar distance determination: a statistically robust sample of homogeneous RGB stars with low observational costs, and independent distance verification through Gaia data. Such SBCRs can be further calibrated and expanded more efficiently and effectively.</description>

      <title>Understanding coronal rain dynamics through a point-mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations and simulations of coronal rain show that as cold and dense plasma falls through the corona it initially undergoes acceleration by gravity before the downward velocity saturates. Simulations have shown the emergence of an unexpected relation between terminal velocity of the rain and density ratio that has not been explained. Our aim is to explain this relation. In this paper we develop a simple point-mass model to understand how the evolution of the ambient corona moving with the coronal rain drop can influence the falling motion. We find that this simple effect results in the downward speed reaching a maximal value before decreasing, which is consistent with simulations with realistic coronal rain mass. These results provide an explanation for the scaling of the maximum downward speed to density ratio of the rain to the corona and as such provide a new tool that may be used to interpret observations.</description>

      <title>Physical conditions around high-mass young star-forming objects via simultaneous observations of excited OH and methanol masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical masers are widely used in star formation studies. In particular, they are valuable in investigations of high-mass star-forming regions that are difficult to observe at optical frequencies. We used multi-transition data to derive physical conditions in the immediate environment of forming high-mass stars. Simultaneous observations of two maser transitions, excited OH at 6.035 GHz and methanol at 6.668 GHz, were made using e-Merlin. Both transitions are radiatively pumped but prefer diverse physical conditions. We imaged ten high-mass star-forming sites with milliarcsecond angular resolution, identifying regions where excited OH and methanol masers coexist and where they avoid each other. Moreover, we identified circularly polarized Zeeman splitting pairs of the OH transition, estimating magnetic field strengths in the range from 0.2 to 10.6~mG. The detection of linearly polarized components enabled us to compare the directions of magnetic field vectors with the outflows coming from the young star-forming objects. We found that the two maser lines appeared to coexist in six high-mass star-forming regions, in cloudlets separated by up to 205~au. Where the lines show avoidance, this can be related to changes in dust and gas temperatures; we also found a few examples suggestive of a high gas density. In seven sources, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests show the nonrandom relationship between the position angles of distribution of the two maser transitions. We did not obtain consistent results regarding the direction of the magnetic field and outflow.</description>

      <title>Data-constrained 3D MHD Simulation of a Spiral Jet Caused by an Unstable Flux Rope Embedded in Fan-spine Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral jets are impulsive plasma ejections that typically show an apparent rotation motion. Their generation, however, is still nont understood thoroughly. Based on a high-resolution vector magnetogram form the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager onboard Solar Orbiter, we constrcut a data-constrained three-dimensional (3D) MHD model, aiming to disclose the eruption mechanism of a tiny spiral jet at a moss region observed on March 3 2022. The initial configuration of the simulation consists of an extrapolated coronal magnetic field based on the vector magnetogram and an inserted unstable flux rope constructed by the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws method. Our results highlight the critical role of the fan-spine configuration in forming the spiral jet and confirm the collapse of the pre-existing magnetic null to a curved 3D current sheet where external reconnection takes places. It is further disclosed that the flux rope quickly moves upward, reconnecting with the field lines near the outer spine, thereby enabling the transfer of twist and cool material from the flux rope to the open field, giving rise to the tiny spiral jet we observed. The notable similarities between these characteristics and those for larger-scale jets suggest that spiral jets, regardless of their scale, essentially share the same eruption mechanism.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of red giant stars with magnetic damping in the core. I. Dissipation of mode energy in dipole-like magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields in the core of red-giant branch stars are expected to suppress the amplitudes of the multipole modes. This occurs when the strength of the internal magnetic field approaches the critical field strength, at which the magnetic forces become comparable to the buoyancy. We performed Hamiltonian ray tracing simulations of magneto-gravity waves to investigate the suppression of the multipole modes in the presence of an internal dipole-like magnetic field. We took into account different stellar masses, metallicities, and ages, as well as various oscillation frequencies and spherical degrees. In particular, we estimated the trapped fraction, a measure of multipole mode suppression, which quantifies the fraction of mode energy in the core that is dissipated by the interaction with the magnetic field. Our results indicate that the trapped fraction can be described by a simple expression, which smoothly connects the regime without multipole mode suppression with the regime with complete suppression of the multipole modes. Crucially, the trapped fraction depends only on the ratio between the strength of the internal magnetic field and the critical field strength. Therefore, our expression for the trapped fraction provides a flexible tool that can be used, for example, to estimate the amount of multipole mode suppression as a star ascends the red-giant branch or to investigate the onset of the suppression in observed power spectral densities.</description>

      <title>Moving Plasma Structures and Possible Driving Mechanisms of Solar Microflares Observed with High-Resolution Coronal Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar microflares are ubiquitous in the solar corona, yet their driving mechanisms remain a subject of ongoing debate. Using high-resolution coronal observations from the Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), we identified about a dozen distinct moving plasma structures (hereafter, `` tiny ejections'') originating from the centers of three homologous microflares out of four successive events. These tiny ejections propagate roughly perpendicular to the flaring loops. They often originate as dot-like structures with a length scale of approximately $10^{3}$ km. While these initial dot-like shapes are observable in EUI images, they remain undetectable in the images captured by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. As they propagate, these dot-like structures consistently evolve into loop-like formations, possibly due to the heating of the surrounding magnetic field. Rather than being generated by a series of flux rope eruptions, the tiny ejections appear to result from small-angle magnetic reconnections within a bipolar field. Thus, the microflares associated with these ejections may be driven by magnetic reconnection within braided fields, a process similar to the proposed nanoflare mechanism and distinct from the standard large-scale flare model.</description>

      <title>Elemental abundances of 44 very metal-poor stars determined from Subaru/IRD near-infrared spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abundances of five elements, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Sr, are investigated for 44 very metal-poor stars (-4.0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1.5) in the Galactic halo system based on an Local Thermodinamic Equilibrium (LTE) analysis of high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with the Infrared Doppler instrument (IRD) on the Subaru Telescope. Mg and Si abundances are determined for all 44 stars. The Si abundances are determined from up to 29 lines, which provide reliable abundance ratios compared to previous results from a few optical lines. The Mg and Si of these stars are over-abundant, relative to iron, and are well-explained by chemical-evolution models. No significant scatter is found in the abundance ratios of both elements with respect to iron, except for a few outliers. The small scatter of the abundance ratios of these elements provides constraints on the variations of stellar and supernova's yields at very low metallicity. Al abundances are determined for 27 stars from near-infrared lines (e.g., 1312nm), which are expected to be less affected by non-LTE (NLTE) effects than optical resonance lines. The average of the [Al/Fe] ratios is close to the solar value, and no dependence on metallicity is found over -3.0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0. Na abundances are determined for 12 stars; they exhibit Solar abundance ratios and no dependence on metallicity. The Sr abundances determined from the Sr II triplet are significantly higher than those from the optical resonance lines obtained by previous studies for our sample. This discrepancy shows a clear dependence on temperature and surface gravity, supporting models that predict large NLTE effects on the near-infrared lines for metal-poor red giants.</description>

      <title>Coronal bright point statistics II. Magnetic polarities and mini loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The solar corona maintains temperatures of a million Kelvin or more. The plasma heating mechanisms responsible for these extreme temperatures are still unclear. Large regions of magnetic activity in the photosphere cause extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission in the corona. Even smaller regions with bipolar and multipolar magnetic fields can generate coronal bright points (CBPs). Aims. We performed a statistical analysis of 346 CBPs. We used Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) images to track CBPs on a continuous basis. Therefore, we were able to collect a database of information on the CPB's lifetime, shape, polarity, flux emergence, and merging behavior, as well as their magnetic evolution, using the SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO-HMI) instrument. Methods. We searched the SDO data archive for the longest continuous interval of uninterrupted observations in 2015. The longest such interval contains 12 consecutive days of full-disk images from the EUV channels of the SDO-AIA instrument. To analyze the properties of CBPs, we employed an automated tracking algorithm to follow the evolution of the CBPs. Furthermore, we manually checked the shape, underlying magnetic polarities, and merging behavior of each CBP. Results. We provide statistics on the magnetic polarity, emergence, and merging of CBPs. We established a relationship between the CBP's merging behavior and both its shape and magnetic polarities. Brighter CBPs are visible in all SDO-AIA channels and exhibit strong radiative energy losses. The category of CBPs with a bipolar field has the highest probability of being emissive in all SDO-AIA channels. The majority of CBPs have two opposite polarities below them. Conclusions. The merging of two CBPs is an unusual phenomenon that is related to complex multipolar magnetic regions. Moreover, loop-shaped CBPs usually appear above bipolar fields...

      <title>A metallicity scale derived from Fe I and FeH lines in the APOGEE M dwarf spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present metallicities derived from a sample of eleven M dwarfs belonging to wide binary systems with warmer FG primary companions observed by the high-resolution (R=22,500) near-infrared SDSS-IV APOGEE spectra. Using a plane-parallel one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis, we determine effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) based on the abundance equilibrium from the Fe I, FeH, OH, and H$_2$O spectral lines. We obtained three $T_{\rm eff}$ scales based on these lines and found that, regardless of the chosen $T_{\rm eff}$ scale, the M dwarf metallicities agree well with those of the warmer primaries, where the upper mean abundance difference limit is 0.04 $\pm$ 0.06. This good agreement confirms that FeH lines are a reliable indicator of $T_{\rm eff}$ in the $H-$band spectra.</description>

      <title>Nearly a Decade of Groundbreaking Speckle Interferometry at the International Gemini Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.</description>

      <title>Extremely iron-poor O-type stars in the Magellanic Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study stars analogous to those in the early Universe with redshift z &gt; 3, we need to probe environments with low metallicities. Until recently, massive O-type stars with metallicities lower than that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z &lt; 20%Z_sol) were only known in compact dwarf galaxies. Observations of stars in such distant galaxies (&gt; 1 Mpc) suffer from limited S/N ratios and spatial resolution. Recently, a few O-type stars were identified in the nearby Magellanic Bridge which offers a unique laboratory with low gas density and metal content. We acquired high-resolution HST-COS FUV spectra of two O-type stars in the Magellanic Bridge. Using the UV forest of iron lines from these observations, we aim to precisely measure the inherent iron abundances and determine the metallicity of the stars. Using detailed expanding non-LTE atmosphere models, we generate synthetic spectra for different iron abundances and for a range of microturbulent velocities. We use Bayesian posterior sampling to measure the iron abundance and compute uncertainties based on the possible range of microturbulent velocities.
  The O stars in the Magellanic Bridge have severely sub-SMC Fe abundances, reaching as low as 10.8% and 3.6% Fe_sol. The most Fe-deficient star also shows alpha-enhancement. These stars are the nearest extremely metal-poor O stars discovered to date. Our finding marks the first robust determination of O-star iron abundances in a metallicity regime comparable to dwarf galaxies like Sextans A and Leo P. The iron abundances of the stars do not correlate with their oxygen abundances. Our results highlight the problem of using oxygen-based metallicities. The proximity of the stars in the Bridge combined with their different abundance patterns underlines that the ISM of the Magellanic Bridge must be highly inhomogeneous and is not properly mixed.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: The Development of Machine Learning Tools for Detecting Millimeter Sources in Timestream Pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new machine learning algorithm for classifying short-duration features in raw time ordered data (TODs) of cosmic microwave background survey observations. The algorithm, specifically designed for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), works in conjunction with the previous TOD preprocessing techniques that employ statistical thresholding to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data, whether they are due to noise features, cosmic rays, or true astrophysical sources in a process called "data cuts". This has the undesirable effect of excising real astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The machine learning algorithm demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD pre-processing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our algorithm also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a sub-minute to minute light curve, providing information on its short timescale variability. This automated algorithm for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Atmospheric Mass Loss and Planet Migration in the Time Evolution of Short-Period Transiting Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparative studies of young and old exoplanet populations offer a glimpse into how planets may form and evolve with time. We present an occurrence rate study of short-period ($&lt;$12 days) planets between 1.8--10 Rearth around 1374 FGK stars in nearby (200 pc) young clusters ($&lt;$1 Gyr), utilizing data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. These planets represent a population closer to their primordial state. We find that the occurrence rate of young planets is higher ($64^{+32}_{-22}$%) compared to the Gyr-old population observed by \kepler ($7.98^{+0.37}_{-0.35}$%). Dividing our sample into bins of young (10--100 Myr) and intermediate (100\,Myr--1 Gyr) ages, we also find that the occurrence distribution in orbital period remains unchanged while the distribution in planet radius changes with time. Specifically, the radius distribution steepens with age, indicative of a larger planet population shrinking due to the atmospheric thermal cooling and mass loss. We also find evidence for an increase (1.9$\sigma$) in occurrence after 100 Myr, possibly due to tidal migration driving planets inside of 12 days. While evidence suggests post-disk migration and atmospheric mass loss shape the population of short-period planets, more detections of young planets are needed to improve statistical comparisons with older planets. Detecting long-period young planets and planets $&lt;$1.8 Rearth will help us understand these processes better. Additionally, studying young planetary atmospheres provides insights into planet formation and the efficiency of atmospheric mass loss mechanisms on the evolution of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>A High-Accuracy Alignment Approach for Solar Images of Different Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image alignment plays a crucial role in solar physics research, primarily involving translation, rotation, and scaling. \G{The different wavelength images of the chromosphere and transition region have structural complexity and differences in similarity, which poses a challenge to their alignment.} Therefore, a novel alignment approach based on dense optical flow (OF) and the RANSAC algorithm is proposed in this paper. \G{It takes the OF vectors of similar regions between images to be used as feature points for matching. Then, it calculates scaling, rotation, and translation.} The study selects three wavelengths for two groups of alignment experiments: the 304 {\AA} of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), the 1216 {\AA} of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), and the 465 {\AA} of the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI). Two methods are used to evaluate alignment accuracy: Monte Carlo simulation and Uncertainty Analysis Based on the Jacobian Matrix (UABJM). \G{The evaluation results indicate that this approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy in the alignment of AIA 304 {\AA} and SDI 1216 {\AA}, while demonstrating higher accuracy in the alignment of AIA 304 {\AA} and SUTRI 465 {\AA}, which have greater similarity.</description>

      <title>Dust Clumping in Outer Protoplanetary Disks: the Interplay Among Four Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust concentration in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is the first step towards planetesimal formation, a crucial yet highly uncertain stage in planet formation. Although the streaming instability (SI) is widely recognized as a powerful mechanism for planetesimal formation, its properties can be sensitive to the gas dynamical environment. The outer region of PPDs is subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), which could further induce the Rossby wave instability (RWI) to generate numerous vortices. In this work, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to perform a 3D global simulation with mesh refinement to achieve adequate domain size and resolution to resolve and accommodate all these instabilities. The VSI mainly governs the overall gas dynamics, dominated by the breathing mode due to dust mass loading. The dust strongly settles to the midplane layer, which is much more densely populated with small vortices compared to the dust-free case. Strong dust clumping is observed, which is likely owing to the joint action of the SI and dusty RWI, and those sufficient for planetesimal formation reside only in a small fraction of such vortices. Dust clumping becomes stronger with increasing resolution, and has not yet achieved numerical convergence in our exploration. In addition, we find evidence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) operating at certain parts of the dust-gas interface, which may contribute to the temporary destruction of dust clumps.</description>

      <title>Scaling and universality in strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive scaling laws that connect certain macroscopic observables of strange quark stars with key microscopic properties of self-bound quark matter, such as the energy per baryon at zero pressure and the strength of repulsive interactions. We also identify universal relations linking global properties of strange quark stars - specifically, their moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and both gravitational and baryonic compactness. Remarkably, these relations hold for two substantially different microscopic models - the quark-mass density-dependent model with excluded-volume corrections and the vector MIT bag model - underscoring their robust, model-independent nature. We demonstrate that the universal relations for strange quark stars differ significantly from those previously established for neutron stars composed of hadronic matter, thus enabling discrimination between the two types of objects without requiring detailed knowledge of their equations of state. Moreover, observational constraints on the maximum mass of compact stars could place bounds on both the depth of quark-matter self-binding and the strength of quark repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Constraints on the Stellar and Planetary Mass Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass function (MF) of isolated objects measured by microlensing consists of both a stellar and a planetary component. We compare the microlensing MFs of Gould et al (2022) and Sumi et al (2023) to other measurements of the MF. The abundance of brown dwarfs in the Sumi et al (2023) stellar MF is consistent with measurements from the local solar neighborhood (Kirkpatrick et al 2024). Microlensing free-floating planets ($\mu$FFPs) may may be free-floating or orbit host stars with semimajor axes $a\gtrsim 10~\mathrm{au}$ and therefore can constrain the populations of both free-floating planetary-mass objects and wide-orbit planets. Comparisons to radial velocity and direct imaging planet populations suggest that either most of the $\mu$FFP population with masses $&gt;1~M_{\rm Jup}$ is bound to hosts more massive than M dwarfs or some fraction of the observed bound population actually comes from the low-mass tail of the stellar population. The $\mu$FFP population also places strong constraints on planets inferred from debris disks and gaps in protoplanetary disks observed by ALMA.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: A multidimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based identification of Gaia astrometric exoplanet orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170\,000 astrometric orbit solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun. Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several Gaia DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine learning approach that uses only the Gaia DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions. Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 20 best candidates of which two are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. The companion around the Sun-like star G\,15-6 could be confirmed as a genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden in Gaia Black Hole Binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered a few candidates of non-interacting single black holes (BHs) and visible stars: Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We call them ``astrometric BH binaries'' collectively. This paper addresses the question if some of these candidates may indeed harbor binary BHs (BBHs), namely, they may be ``astrometric BBH triples'' that have not been discovered yet. We focus on open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of astrometric BH binaries, and estimate the formation rate of such astrometric BBH triples using gravitational $N$-body simulations. We find that formation efficiency of astrometric BBH triples is fairly high if they are in low-metallicity environments; $\sim 10^{-6} {\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ \% of astrometric BH binaries. On the other hand, no such astrometric BBH triple is formed in the solar-metallicity environments. Most of the astrometric BBH triples in our simulations turn out to be dynamically stable for $10$ Gyrs, indicating that $\sim 10$ \% of astrometric BH binary candidates may indeed harbor inner BBHs if they originate from open star clusters in low-metallicity environments. Astrometric BBH triples can be distinguished from astrometric BH binaries with the radial velocity follow-up of the tertiary star. Our simulated samples statistically suggest that a few percents of astrometric BH binary candidates should exhibit detectable radial velocity modulations due to the inner BBHs. They preferentially have ``outer'' orbital periods of $\gtrsim 10^3$ days, and moderately high ``outer'' orbital eccentricity of $\gtrsim 0.7$. Our current result strongly motivates the search for astrometric BBH triples in the upcoming Gaia final data release.</description>

Abstract: When a hot Jupiter orbits a star whose effective temperature exceeds $\sim$6100 K, its orbit normal tends to be misaligned with the stellar spin axis. Cooler stars typically have smaller obliquities, which may have been damped by hot Jupiters in resonance lock with axisymmetric stellar gravity modes (azimuthal number $m=0$). Here we allow for resonance locks with non-axisymmetric modes, which affect both stellar obliquity and spin frequency. Obliquities damp for all modes ($-2 \leq m \leq 2$). Stars spin up for $m &gt; 0$, and spin down for $m &lt; 0$. We carry out a population synthesis that assumes hot Jupiters form misaligned around both cool and hot stars, and subsequently lock onto modes whose $m$-values yield the highest mode energies for given starting obliquities. Core hydrogen burning enables hot Jupiters to torque low-mass stars, but not high-mass stars, into spin-orbit alignment. Resonance locking plus stellar spin-down from magnetic braking largely reproduces observed obliquities and stellar rotation rates and how they trend with stellar effective temperature and orbital separation. The possible suppression of resonance locking by non-linear dissipation of gravity waves remains an outstanding issue.</description>
