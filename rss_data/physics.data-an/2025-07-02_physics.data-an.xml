      <title>Discovering the underlying analytic structure within Standard Model constants using artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a search for underlying analytic structures among the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM) using symbolic regression and genetic programming. We identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable observations based on about a thousand expressions with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Unfolding for Neutrino Cross-section Measurements with the OmniFold Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of unfolding method for a cross-section measurement is tightly coupled to the model dependence of the efficiency correction and the overall impact of cross-section modeling uncertainties in the analysis. A key issue is the dimensionality used in unfolding, as the kinematics of all outgoing particles in an event typically affect the reconstruction performance in a neutrino detector. OmniFold is an unfolding method that iteratively reweights a simulated dataset, using machine learning to utilize arbitrarily high-dimensional information, that has previously been applied to proton-proton and proton-electron datasets. This paper demonstrates OmniFold's application to a neutrino cross-section measurement for the first time using a public T2K near detector simulated dataset, comparing its performance with traditional approaches using a mock data study.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Single-Ended Event Reconstruction in PROSPECT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, was a segmented antineutrino detector that successfully operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge, TN, during its 2018 run. Despite challenges with photomultiplier tube base failures affecting some segments, innovative machine learning approaches were employed to perform position and energy reconstruction, and particle classification. This work highlights the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks in enhancing data analysis. By leveraging these techniques, a 3.3\% increase in effective statistics was achieved compared to traditional methods, showcasing their potential to improve analysis performance. Furthermore, these machine learning methodologies offer promising applications for other segmented particle detectors, underscoring their versatility and impact.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridges for Systems of Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy-regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.</description>

      <title>Inherited or produced? Inferring protein production kinetics when protein counts are shaped by a cell's division history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring protein production kinetics for dividing cells is complicated protein inheritance from the mother cell. For instance, fluorescence measurements -- commonly used to assess gene activation -- may reflect not only newly produced proteins but also those inherited through successive cell divisions. In such cases, observed protein levels in any given cell are shaped by its division history. As a case study, we examine activation of the glc3 gene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under nutrient-limiting conditions. We monitor this activity using snapshot fluorescence measurements via flow cytometry, where GFP expression reflects glc3 promoter activity. A na\"ive analysis of flow cytometry data ignoring cell division suggests many cells are active with low expression. Explicitly accounting for the (non-Markovian) effects of cell division and protein inheritance makes it impossible to write down a tractable likelihood -- a key ingredient in physics-inspired inference, defining the probability of observing data given a model. The dependence on a cell's division history breaks the assumptions of standard (Markovian) master equations, rendering traditional likelihood-based approaches inapplicable. Instead, we adapt conditional normalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn probability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods from simulated data. In doing so, we find that glc3 is mostly inactive under stress, showing that while cells occasionally activate the gene, expression is brief and transient.</description>
