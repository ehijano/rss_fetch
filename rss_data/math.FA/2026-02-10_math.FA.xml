      <title>The Role of Gr\"obner Bases in the Study of Extremal Truncated Moment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a 2014 paper, R.E. Curto and S. Yoo proved that a moment matrix $M(3)$ with specific harmonic polynomials as column relations admits a representing measure if and only if a condition at the level of moments holds. \ In this paper, we generalize the 2014 result to arbitrary moment matrices $M(k)$ ($k \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$), with column relations given by general harmonic polynomials. \ We accomplish this by proving that the Gr\"obner basis for the ideal generated by a finite variety associated with the moment matrix provides all the necessary column relations for the matrix as well as a suitable condition on the moments, which is equivalent to the existence of a representing measure.</description>

Abstract: We give a sharp characterization of how additional integrability in the interior improves the integrability of boundary traces of $\mathrm{W}^{1,p}$-Sobolev functions. The optimality of our results relies on a novel nonlinear extension or lifting operator.</description>

      <title>A Fubini Theorem for Grothendieck Functional Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically studies the subset of continuous linear functionals on the projective tensor product of Banach spaces whose norms are bounded by Grothendieck's constant $K_G$. We term such functionals Grothendieck functional integrals. The integral is defined as a linear functional on the projective tensor product space that satisfies the boundedness condition $|\mu(x)| \leq K_G \|x\|_\pi$, where $K_G$ denotes Grothendieck's constant. We prove that such integrals admit a Hilbert space representation theorem and establish the corresponding abstract Fubini theorem to demonstrate that the order of integration may be interchanged. Furthermore, we extend this theory to the setting of multiple tensor products and provide integral representations in concrete function spaces. Our work offers a unified framework for bilinear and multilinear analysis, with a universal constant serving as the fundamental bound.</description>

      <title>The Helton-Howe measure of almost normal Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Helton-Howe measure associated with an almost normal operator was constructed by Helton and Howe. It provides a trace formula that allows us to calculate the trace of commutators that would otherwise be incalculable. We will investigate almost normal Toeplitz operators and determine their Helton-Howe measures in terms of the harmonic extensions of the symbols. Our result may be thought of as a generalization of the winding number formula of the Fredholm index of a Toeplitz operator.</description>

      <title>The iterated Aluthge Transforms of compact operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space. Then the Aluthge transform $\Delta T$ and the sequence $(\Delta^nT)$ of Aluthge iterates of $T$ are defined by
  \begin{align*}
  \Delta T=|T|^{1/2}U|T|^{1/2},\,\Delta^0T=T,\,\Delta^nT=\Delta(\Delta^{n-1}T),\,n\in\mathbb{N}.
  \end{align*}
  We prove that $\Delta$ is a continuous map on the space of all compact operators on a separable Hilbert space with respect to the norm topology and using this result we also prove that the sequence $(\Delta^nT)$ converges in the norm topology to a normal compact operator for every compact operator $T$ on a separable Hilbert space. This gives an affirmative answer to two questions raised by Jung, Ko and Pearcy \cite{Pearcy2} for compact operators.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian Conjugate Rogers-Shephard Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fuse between the Rogers-Shephard inequality for the Lebesgue measure and Royen's Gaussian Correlation Inequality, simultaneously extending both into a single sharp inequality for the Gaussian measure $\gamma$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, stating that \[ \gamma(K) \gamma(L) \leq \gamma(K\cap L) \gamma(K+L) \] whenever $K$ and $L$ are origin-symmetric convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This confirms a conjecture of M. Tehranchi [https://doi.org/10.1214/17-ECP89]. In fact, we show that the inequality remains valid whenever the Gaussian barycenters of $K$ and $L$ are at the origin, and characterize the equality cases. After rescaling, this also yields the following new inequality for convex sets with (Lebesgue) barycenters at the origin: \[ |K| |L| \leq |K \cap L| |K + L | ; \] this can be seen as a conjugate counterpart to Spingarn's extension of the Rogers-Shephard inequality (where $K+L$ is replaced by $K-L$ above). We also derive an additional conjugate version of a Gaussian inequality due to V. Milman and Pajor, as well as several extensions. Our main tool is a new Gaussian Forward-Reverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality for centered log-concave functions, of independent interest, which is crucially applicable to degenerate Gaussian covariances.</description>

      <title>The Banach-Tarski paradox in complete discretely valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove some results related to the classical Banach--Tarski paradox in the setting of a field $\mathbb{K}$ that is complete with respect to a discrete non-Archimedean valuation (e.g., when $\mathbb{K}$ is the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers for a prime $p$). Namely, the field $\mathbb{K}$, as well as all balls and spheres in $\mathbb{K}$, admit a paradoxical decomposition with respect to the isometry group of $\mathbb{K}$. Such decompositions can be realized using pieces with the Baire property if $\mathbb{K}$ is separable. Under the additional assumption of local compactness of $\mathbb{K}$ (e.g., when $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}_p$), any two bounded subsets of $\mathbb{K}$ with nonempty interiors are equidecomposable with respect to the isometry group of $\mathbb{K}$.
  Our results complete the study of paradoxical decompositions in the non-Archimedean setting, addressing the one-dimensional case and building on earlier work for higher-dimensional normed spaces over $\mathbb{K}$ with respect to groups of affine isometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness and compactness of weighted composition operators acting on weighted Dirichlet spaces and determine the spectrum of a certain class of such operators. Our results extend earlier work on unweighted composition operators and highlight the close interplay between the operator theoretic behavior of weighted composition operators and the function theoretic properties of their inducing functions. Several examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of the obtained results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of partially defined complete positivity preservers, extending Schoenberg's classical characterization to functions defined only on discrete subsets or constrained domains. We frame the extension problem through the theory of completely positive maps on operator systems -- we characterize general partially defined completely positive definite functions on general homogeneous spaces. We apply our interpolation to constrained packing problems and Delsarte theory, where one uses positive definite functions on homogeneous spaces to obtain bounds on various packing problems. We prove the specific positive definite function witnesses that a code is sharp for constrained angle codes must be from polynomials.</description>

      <title>Featured Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces for Learning and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces provide a foundational framework for kernel-based learning, where regularization and interpolation problems admit finite-dimensional solutions through classical representer theorems. Many modern learning models, however -- including fixed-architecture neural networks equipped with non-quadratic norms -- naturally give rise to non-Hilbertian geometries that fall outside this setting. In Banach spaces, continuity of point-evaluation functionals alone is insufficient to guarantee feature representations or kernel-based learning formulations. In this work, we develop a functional-analytic framework for learning in Banach spaces based on the notion of featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces. We identify the precise structural conditions under which feature maps, kernel constructions, and representer-type results can be recovered beyond the Hilbertian regime. Within this framework, supervised learning is formulated as a minimal-norm interpolation or regularization problem, and existence results together with conditional representer theorems are established. We further extend the theory to vector-valued featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces and show that fixed-architecture neural networks naturally induce special instances of such spaces. This provides a unified function-space perspective on kernel methods and neural networks and clarifies when kernel-based learning principles extend beyond reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Real Bers embedding on the line: Fisher-Rao linearization, Schwarzian curvature, and scattering coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a real-analytic counterpart of the Bers embedding for the Fr\'echet Lie group $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$ of decay-controlled diffeomorphisms of the line, and establish its connection to $L^p$ Fisher-Rao geometry on densities. For $p\in[1,\infty)$, the $p$-root map $\varphi\mapsto p(\varphi'^{1/p}-1)$ isometrically linearizes the homogeneous $\dot W^{1,p}$ Finsler metric on $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$, yielding explicit geodesics and a canonical flat connection whose Eulerian geodesic equation is the generalized Hunter-Saxton equation; for $p=\infty$, logarithmic coordinates $\varphi\mapsto\log\varphi'$ provide a global isometry and the Schwarzian derivative emerges as the projective curvature. We construct a real Bers map $\beta^{-\infty}\colon\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)/\Aff(\R)\to W^{\infty,1}(\R)$ via this Schwarzian, prove it is a Fr\'echet-smooth injective immersion whose linearization admits a tame right inverse given by an explicit Volterra operator, and characterize its image through Sturm-Liouville spectral theory. We introduce an $L^p$-Schwarzian family $S_p$ that interpolates between affine and projective cocycles, establish full asymptotic expansions as $p\to\infty$ in Fr\'echet and Orlicz-Sobolev scales, and extend the Bers embedding to Orlicz diffeomorphism groups. Through the Jacobian correspondence, these structures transfer to a manifold of densities asymptotic to Lebesgue measure, where the nonlinear Eulerian transport reduces to a pointwise Riccati law and the Schwarzian becomes the score curvature governing Fisher information. The compact-manifold $L^p$ Fisher-Rao linearization of Bauer, Bruveris, Harms, and Michor is recalled as a guiding framework.</description>

      <title>Multiple convolutions and multilinear fractal Fourier extension estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08568v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Stein--Tomas theorem extends the theory of linear Fourier restriction estimates from smooth manifolds to fractal measures exhibiting Fourier decay. In the multilinear setting, transversality allows for Fourier extension estimates that go beyond those implied by the linear theory to hold. We establish a multilinear Fourier extension estimate for measures whose convolution belongs to an $L^p$ space, applicable to known results by Shmerkin and Solomyak that exploit `transversality' between self-similar measures. Moreover, we generalise work by Hambrook--{\L}aba and Chen from the linear setting to obtain Knapp-type examples for multilinear estimates; we obtain two necessary conditions: one in terms of the upper box dimension of the measures' supports, and another one in terms of their Fourier decay and a ball condition. In particular, these conditions give a more restrictive range compared with previously known results whenever the convolution of the measures at play is singular.</description>

      <title>Intersections of translates of finite-dimensionally valued frame spaces are conditionally slice-full and almost slice-full</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10103v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work, the topology of frame spaces $\mathcal{F}_{(X,\mu),n}$ has been studied via Stiefel manifolds, revealing in particular a connectedness property for intersections of their translates when $\operatorname{span}(\{a_j\}_{j \in J}$ is not too large, in fact when $\operatorname{codim}(\operatorname{span}\{a_j^l\}_{(j,l) \in J \times [\![1,n]\!]}) \geq 3n$, where $\{a_j\}_{j \in J}$ is the translating family \cite{ElIdrissiKabbajMoalige2023}. These investigations naturally lead to finer questions about the linear geometry and measure-theoretic structure of such intersections. The present article addresses these questions by uncovering an almost-linear structure within intersections of translated frame spaces. We show that the set of non-frames in finite-dimensional Hilbert $C^*$-modules is not merely a "small" subset in a topological or measure-theoretic sense but has a precise algebraic description as a real affine algebraic subvariety. In particular, using additional measure-theoretic arguments, we prove that for any finite-dimensional Hilbert $C^*$-module $\mathcal{H}$ and any countable collection of translates of the frame space $\mathcal{F}_{(X,\mu),\mathcal{H}}$, the intersection is conditionally slice-full in $L^2(X,\mu;\mathcal{H})$ and almost surely slice-full. We inform the reader that the notions of real affine algebraic subvarieties (although closely related to ind-varieties) and (conditionally) slice-full subsets (although closely related to prevalence and Haar-null sets) of a Hausdorff topological vector space are, to our knowledge, both new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents the $L^p$-Heisenberg--Pauli--Weyl uncertainty inequality for the group Fourier transform on a class of two-step nilpotent Lie groups, specifically the M\'etivier groups. This inequality quantitatively demonstrates that on M\'etivier groups, a nonzero function and its group Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. The proof primarily relies on utilizing the dilation structure inherent to two-step nilpotent Lie groups and estimating the Schatten class norms of the group Fourier transform. The inequality we establish is new, even in the simplest case of Heisenberg groups. Our result significantly sharpens all previously known $L^p$-Heisenberg--Pauli--Weyl uncertainty inequalities for $1 \leq p &lt; 2$ on M\'etivier groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine the well-known Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek Theorem which states that a norm one linear operator defined on a Banach space is an isometry if and only if it preserves orthogonality at every element of the space. We improve the result for Banach spaces in which the set of all smooth points forms a dense $G_{\delta}$-set by proving that a norm one linear operator that preserves orthogonality on a dense subset of the space is an isometry. We further demonstrate that if such an operator preserves orthogonality on a hyperplane not passing through the origin then it is an isometry. In the context of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, we prove that preserving orthogonality on the set all extreme points of the unit ball forces the operator to be an isometry, which substantially refines Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek theorem. Finally, for finite-dimensional polyhedral spaces, we establish the significance of the set of all $k$-smooth points for any possible $k,$ in the study of isometric theory.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the topologizability and power boundedness of convolution and dual convolution operators on power series spaces. We determine necessary conditions for a Toeplitz operator to be m-topologizable, and power bounded on $\Lambda_{1}(n)$ and $\Lambda_{\infty}(n)$, and consequently on $H(\mathbb{C})$ and $H(\mathbb{D})$.</description>

      <title>Sequences that do frame reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frames allow all elements of a Hilbert space to be reconstructed by inner product data in a stable manner. Recently, there is interest in relaxing the definition of frames to understand the implications for stable signal recovery. In this paper, we relax the definition of a frame by allowing the operator in the frame decomposition formula to not be invertible. We provide a complete classification of sequences that allow this decomposition via a type of frame operator. Additionally, we provide several examples of sequences that allow this reconstruction property that are not frames and illustrate in which ways they fail to be frames. Furthermore, we provide a Paley-Wiener type stability result for sequences that do this frame-like reconstruction, which is also stable under the non-frame property. Finally, we classify certain Schauder bases-such as unconditional and exponential bases-that satisfy this relaxed frame reconstruction condition.</description>

      <title>Rademacher's Theorem for Calderon-Zygmund-type Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rademacher's Theorem can be interpreted as an almost-everywhere \emph{little-$o$ improvement principle}: if a function admits a uniform pointwise first-order Lipschitz control at every point, then this control improves to a vanishing one at almost every point. In the language of Calder\'on--Zygmund pointwise spaces, this means that \[ f \in T^\infty_1(x) \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad f \in t^\infty_1(x) \quad \text{for a.e. } x \in \mathbb{R}^d. \]
  The purpose of this paper is to establish an analogous almost-everywhere improvement principle in a refined $L^p$ setting. We consider pointwise Calder\'on-Zygmund spaces $T^p_{\phi}(x)$ defined via polynomial approximation in $L^p$ with a function parameter $\phi$, allowing for fractional regularity indices and logarithmic corrections through Boyd functions. We prove that, under natural assumptions on $\phi$, the uniform membership \[ f \in T^p_{\phi}(x) \quad \forall x \in E \] on a measurable set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ implies an almost-everywhere improvement to a vanishing approximation rate, namely \[ f \in t^p_{\phi,n+1}(x) \quad \text{for a.e. } x \in E, \] where $n &lt; \underline{b}(\phi) \leq \overline{b}(\phi) &lt; n+1$.
  The proof combines measurability arguments, a generalized Whitney extension theorem, and fine properties of Sobolev spaces. We also show that this result is essentially sharp: in general, one cannot expect almost-everywhere membership in $t^p_{\phi,n}(x)$ for fractional indices, and explicit counterexamples are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two notions of a contractive orbit of a set-valued map defined in a first countable space. The first defines the contraction with respect to the topology of the underlying space while the second defines the contraction with respect to a generalized distance function. We characterize the Hausdorff property of first countable $T_1$ spaces via fixed point theorems for set-valued maps with a contractive orbit satisfying some additional assumptions. As an application, we derive a sufficient condition for a function to attain a strong minimum and generalize Cantor's intersection theorem for a sequence of closed nested sets with diameters converging to 0.</description>

      <title>Sharp Variational Estimates of Stein--Wainger Type Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any integer $n \geq 2$, we establish $L^p(\R^n)$ inequalities for the $r$-variations of Stein-Wainger type oscillatory integral operators with general radial phase functions. These inequalities closely related to Carleson's theorem are sharp, up to endpoints. In particular, when the phase function is chosen as $|t|^\A$ with $\A\in (0,1)$,
  our results provide an affirmative answer to a question posed in Guo-Roos-Yung (Anal. PDE, 2020). Furthermore, we obtain the restricted weak type estimates for endpoints in the specific case of homogeneous phase functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolev extension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential operators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitz domains, and also domains with fractal boundaries. Although our variational formulation does not involve any measures on the boundary, we recover the classical results in smooth domains by considering the surface measure on the boundary. We discuss properties of these operators and generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <title>Fine properties of nonlinear potentials and a unified perspective on monotonicity formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

      <title>Twisted Fourier transforms on non-Kac compact quantum groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an analytic family of twisted Fourier transforms $\left\{\mathcal{F}^{(x)}_p\right\}_{x\in \mathbb{R},p\in [1,2)}$ for non-Kac compact quantum groups and establish a sharpened form of the Hausdorff-Young inequality in the range $0\leq x \leq 1$. Furthermore, we prove that the range $0\leq x \leq 1$ is both necessary and sufficient for the boundedness of $\mathcal{F}^{(x)}_p$ under the assumption of sub-exponential growth on the dual discrete quantum group. We also show that the range of boundedness of $\mathcal{F}^{(x)}_p$ can be strictly extended beyond $[0,1]$ for certain non-Kac and non-coamenable free orthogonal quantum groups. As applications, we derive a stronger form of the twisted rapid decay property for polynomially growing non-Kac discrete quantum groups, including the duals of the Drinfeld-Jimbo $q$-deformations, and construct an explicit contractive, but non-completely bounded, representation of the convolution algebra of any non-Kac free orthogonal quantum group.</description>

      <title>Precompactness notions in Kaplansky--Hilbert modules and extensions with discrete spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our work on the functional-analytic core of the classical Furstenberg-Zimmer theory. We introduce and study (in the framework of lattice-ordered spaces) the notions of total order-boundedness and uniform total order-boundedness. Either one generalizes the concept of ordinary precompactness known from metric space theory. These new notions are then used to define and characterize "compact extensions" of general measure-preserving systems (with no restrictions on the underlying probability spaces nor on the acting groups). In particular, it is (re)proved that compact extensions and extensions with discrete spectrum are one and the same thing. Finally, we show that under natural hypotheses a subset of a Kaplansky-Banach module is totally order bounded if and only if it is cyclically compact (in the sense of Kusraev).</description>

      <title>Contraction of the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Triple Associated to the $(k,a)$-Generalized Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ben Sa\"{\i}d-Kobayashi-Orsted introduced a family of $ \mathfrak{sl}_2 $-triples of differential-difference operators $ \mathbb{H}_{k,a} $, $ \mathbb{E}^+_{k,a} $ and $ \mathbb{E}^-_{k,a} $ on $ \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \{0\} $ indexed by a Dunkl parameter $ k $ and a deformation parameter $ a \neq 0 $. In the present paper, we study the behavior as the parameter $ a $ approaches $ 0 $. In this limit, the Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}_{k,a} = \operatorname{span}_\mathbb{R} \bigl\{\mathbb{H}_{k,a}, \mathbb{E}^+_{k,a}, \mathbb{E}^-_{k,a}\bigr\} \cong \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}) $ contracts to a three-dimensional commutative Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}_{k,0}$, and its spectral properties change. We describe the joint spectral decomposition for $ \mathfrak{g}_{k,0}$, and discuss formulas for operator semigroups with infinitesimal generators in $ \mathfrak{g}_{k,0}$. In particular, we describe the integral kernel of $ \exp\bigl(z |x|^2 \Delta_k\bigr) $ as an infinite series, which, in some low-dimensional cases, can be expressed in a closed form using the theta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present direct and elementary commutator techniques for the Dirac equation with long-range electric and mass perturbations. The main results are absence of generalized eigenfunctions and locally uniform resolvent estimates, both in terms of the optimal Besov-type spaces. With an additional massless assumption, we also obtain an algebraic radiation condition of projection type. For their proofs, following the scheme of Ito-Skibsted, we adopt, along with various weight functions, the generator of radial translations as conjugate operator, and avoid any of advanced functional analysis, pseudodifferential calculus, or even reduction to the Schr\"odinger equation. The results of the paper would serve as a foundation for the stationary scattering theory of the Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>On regions of mixed unitarity for semigroups of unital quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is established that both discrete and continuous semigroups of unital quantum channels are eventually mixed unitary. This result is novel even for the subclass of Schur maps and stands in sharp contrast to the resolution of the asymptotic quantum Birkhoff conjecture by Haagerup and Musat, who demonstrated that tensor powers of some unital quantum channels maintain a persistent positive distance from the set of mixed unitary channels. Remarkably, our results show that this gap vanishes in finite time when considering ordinary powers within a semigroup.
  Building on this, we define the mixed unitary index of a unital quantum channel as the minimum time (or power) beyond which all subsequent maps become mixed unitary. We demonstrate that for any fixed dimension $d \geq 3$, there is no universal upper bound for this index. Furthermore, we observe that if a continuous semigroup is not mixed unitary at some $t &gt; 0$, it remains non-mixed unitary for all $t$ sufficiently close to the origin. Finally, we investigate quantum dynamical semigroups where mixed unitarity is restricted to specific families, such as Weyl or diagonal unitaries. We show that Schur semigroups of correlation matrices eventually become mixtures of rank-one correlation matrices, and we characterize the generators of Schur semigroups that remain within this set for all $t \geq 0$.</description>
