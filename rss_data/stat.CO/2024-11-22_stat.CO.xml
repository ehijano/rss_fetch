      <title>Error Analysis of Sum-Product Algorithms under Stochastic Rounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of numerical computations can be measured through their forward error, for which finding good error bounds is challenging in general. For several algorithms and using stochastic rounding (SR), probabilistic analysis has been shown to be an effective alternative for obtaining tight error bounds. This analysis considers the distribution of errors and evaluates the algorithm's performance on average. Using martingales and the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality, it provides error bounds that are valid with a certain probability and in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}u)$ instead of deterministic worst-case bounds in $\mathcal{O}(nu)$, where $n$ is the number of operations and $u$ is the unit roundoff.In this paper, we present a general method that automatically constructs a martingale for any computation scheme with multi-linear errors based on additions, subtractions, and multiplications. We apply this generalization to algorithms previously studied with SR, such as pairwise summation and the Horner algorithm, and prove equivalent results. We also analyze a previously unstudied algorithm, Karatsuba polynomial multiplication, which illustrates that the method can handle reused intermediate computations.</description>

      <title>The Double Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer models (simulators) are vital tools for investigating physical processes. Despite their utility, the prohibitive run-time of simulators hinders their direct application for uncertainty quantification. Gaussian process emulators (GPEs) have been used extensively to circumvent the cost of the simulator and are known to perform well on simulators with smooth, stationary output. In reality, many simulators violate these assumptions. Motivated by a finite element simulator which models early stage corrosion of uranium in water vapor, we propose an adaption of the GPE, called the double emulator, specifically for simulators which 'ground' in a considerable volume of their input space. Grounding is the process by which a simulator attains its minimum and can result in violation of the stationarity and smoothness assumptions used in the conventional GPE. We perform numerical experiments comparing the performance of the GPE and double emulator on both the corrosion simulator and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for Stationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time with applications to fitting time series models. In particular, for a symmetric Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy of the log-likelihood approximation from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate solutions to linear systems with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are generated by a piecewise smooth $S(\omega)$. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</description>
