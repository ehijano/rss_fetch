      <title>Extending Strongly Ulam Stable Groups and Towards Inductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show some preservation results of amenably extending strongly Ulam stable groups under mild decay assumptions, including quantitative preservation of asymptotic bounds under the assumption that the modulus of stability is H\"older continuous of exponent $s&gt;\frac 1 2$ at 0, utilizing some simplistic integral estimates. Additionally, we show some partial results around inductive preservation of modulus bounds in infinite dimensions using these integral estimates as well as strong quantitative preservation in the finite dimensional case, implying the existence of $\mathfrak{U}$ uniformly stable existential closures among groups with sufficiently large Lipschitz estimates of any countable group.</description>

      <title>Thurston norm for coherent right-angled Artin groups via $L^2$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new notion of splitting complexity for a group $G$ along a non-trivial integral character $\phi \in H^1(G; \mathbb{Z})$. If $G$ is a one-ended coherent right-angled Artin group, we show that the splitting complexity along an epimorphism $\phi \colon G \to \mathbb{Z}$ equals the $L^2$-Euler characteristic of the kernel of $\phi$. This allows us to define a Thurston-type semi-norm $\| \cdot \|_T \colon H^1(G ; \mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ that measures the splitting complexity of integral characters. Our main tool is Friedl--L\"{u}ck's $L^2$-polytope which we compute for all groups in this class.</description>

      <title>Perfect kernel of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the space of subgroups of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS groups), that is, groups acting cocompactly on an oriented tree without inversion and with infinite cyclic vertex and edge stabilizers. Our results generalize the study of Baumslag-Solitar groups in [CGLMS22]. Given a GBS group G defined by a graph of groups whose existence is given by Bass-Serre theory, we associate to any subgroup of G an integer, which is a generalization of the phenotype defined in [CGLMS22]. This quantity is invariant under conjugation and allows us to decompose the perfect kernel of G into pieces which are invariant under conjugation and on which G acts highly topologically transitively. To achieve this, we interpret graphs of subgroups of G as "blown up and shrunk" Schreier graphs of transitive actions of G. We also describe the topology of the pieces which appear in the decomposition.</description>

      <title>The semigroup of finite partial order isomorphisms of a bounded rank of an infinite linear ordered set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algebraic properties of the semigroup $\mathscr{O\!\!I\!}_n(L)$ of finite partial order isomorphisms of the rank $\leq n$ of an infinite linearly ordered set $(L,\leqslant)$. In particular we describe its idempotents, the natural partial order and Green's relations on $\mathscr{O\!\!I\!}_n(L)$. It is proved that the semigroup $\mathscr{O\!\!I\!}_n(L)$ is stable and it contains tight ideal series. Moreover, we show that the semigroup $\mathscr{O\!\!I\!}_n(L)$ admits only Rees' congruences and every its homomorphic image is a semigroup with tight ideal series.</description>

      <title>Coboundary expansion of coset complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coboundary expansion is a high dimensional generalization of the Cheeger constant to simplicial complexes. Originally, this notion was motivated by the fact that it implies topological expansion, but nowadays a significant part of the motivation stems from its deep connection to problems in theoretical computer science such as agreement expansion in the low soundness regime. In this paper, we prove coboundary expansion with non-Abelian coefficients for the coset complex construction of Kaufman and Oppenheim. Our proof uses a novel global argument, as opposed to the local-to-global arguments that are used to prove cosystolic expansion.</description>

      <title>Matrix Elements and Characters of the Discrete Series ("Massive") Unitary Irreducible Representations of Sp(4,R)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper obtains the matrix elements and characters of the discrete series unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Sp$(4,\mathbb{R})$ group. With an isomorphic relationship to the two-fold covering of SO$_0(2,3)$ (Sp$(4,\mathbb{R}) \sim$ SO$_0(2,3)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$), this group holds particular importance as the kinematical/relativity group within the framework of ($1+3$-dimensional) anti-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>The normal decomposition of a morphism in categories without zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a morphism f in a category C with sufficiently many finite limits and colimits, we discuss an elementary construction of a decomposition of f through objects P and N which, if C happens to have a zero object, amounts to the standard decomposition of f through P = Coker(ker f) and N = Ker(coker f). In this way we obtain natural notions of normal monomorphism and normal epimorphism also in non-pointed categories, as special types of regular mono- and epimorphisms. We examine the factorization behaviour of these classes of morphisms in general, compare the generalized normal decompositions with other types of threefold factorizations, and illustrate them in some every-day categories. The concrete construction of normal decompositions in the slices or coslices of these categories can be challenging. Amongst many others, in this regard, we consider particularly the categories of T1-spaces and of groups.</description>

      <title>Every finite nilpotent loop has a supernilpotent loop as reduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A basic fact taught in undergraduate algebra courses is that every finite nilpotent group is a direct product of $p$-groups. Already Bruck observed that this does not generalize to loops. In particular, there exist nilpotent loops of size $6$ which are not direct products of loops of size $2$ and $3$. Still we show that every finite nilpotent loop $(A,\cdot)$ has a binary term operation $*$ such that $(A,*)$ is a direct product of nilpotent loops of prime power order, i.e., $(A,*)$ is supernilpotent. As an application we obtain that every nilpotent loop of order $pq$ for primes $p,q$ has a finite basis for its equational theory.</description>

      <title>Radical subgroups of finite reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radical subgroups play an important role in both finite group theory and representation theory. This is the first of a series of papers of ours in classifying radical $p$-subgroups of finite reductive groups and in verifying the inductive blockwise Alperin weight condition for them, contributing to the program of proving the Alperin weight conjecture by verifying its inductive condition for finite simple groups. In this paper we present a uniform method for classifying radical subgroups of finite reductive groups. As applications, we investigate the inductive blockwise Alperin weight condition for classical groups, as well as groups of type $F_4$.</description>

      <title>Artin-Schreier towers of finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a prime number $p$, we consider the tower of finite fields $F_p=L_{-1}\subset L_0\subset L_1\subset\cdots$, where each step corresponds to an Artin-Schreier extension of degree $p$, so that for $i\geq 0$, $L_{i}=L_{i-1}[c_{i}]$, where $c_i$ is a root of $X^p-X-a_{i-1}$ and $a_{i-1}=(c_{-1}\cdots c_{i-1})^{p-1}$, with $c_{-1}=1$. We extend and strengthen to arbitrary primes prior work of Popovych for $p=2$ on the multiplicative order of the given generator $c_i$ for $L_i$ over $L_{i-1}$. In particular, for $i\geq 0$, we show that $O(c_i)=O(a_i)$, except only when $p=2$ and $i=1$, and that $O(c_i)$ is equal to the product of the orders of $c_j$ modulo $L_{j-1}^\times$, where $0\leq j\leq i$ if $p$ is odd, and $i\geq 2$ and $1\leq j\leq i$ if $p=2$. We also show that for $i\geq 0$, the $\mathrm{Gal}(L_i/L_{i-1})$-conjugates of $a_i$ form a normal basis of $L_i$ over $L_{i-1}$. In addition, we obtain the minimal polynomial of $c_1$ over $F_p$ in explicit form.</description>
