      <title>Loops, Holonomy and Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is a topology on the group of loops in euclidean space such that this group is embedded in a Lie group which is simple relative to the loops. An extension of this Lie group gives the structural group of a principal bundle with connection whose holonomy coincides with the Chen signature map. We also give an alternative geometric new proof of Chen signature Theorem.</description>

      <title>Classification of Stable Surfaces with respect to Automatic Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of when the homeomorphism group of a stable surface, $\Sigma$, has the automatic continuity property: Any homomorphism from Homeo$(\Sigma)$ to a separable group is necessarily continuous. This result descends to a classification of when the mapping class group of $\Sigma$ has the automatic continuity property. Towards this classification, we provide a general framework for proving automatic continuity for groups of homeomorphisms. Applying this framework, we also show that the homeomorphism group of any stable second countable Stone space has the automatic continuity property. Under the presence of stability this answers two questions of Mann.</description>

      <title>Averages of determinants of Laplacians over moduli spaces for large genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. We view the regularized determinant $\log \det(\Delta_{X})$ of Laplacian as a function on $\mathcal{M}_g$ and show that there exists a universal constant $E&gt;0$ such that as $g\to \infty$,
  (1) the expected value of $\left|\frac{\log \det(\Delta_{X})}{4\pi(g-1)}-E \right|$ over $\mathcal{M}_g$ has rate of decay $g^{-\delta}$ for some uniform constant $\delta \in (0,1)$;
  (2) the expected value of $\left|\frac{\log \det(\Delta_{X})}{4\pi(g-1)}\right|^\beta$ over $\mathcal{M}_g$ approaches to $E^\beta$ whenever $\beta \in [1,2)$.</description>

      <title>The Alexander polynomial of twisted torus knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted torus knots are a generalization of torus knots, obtained by introducing additional full twists to adjacent strands of the torus knots. In this article, we present an explicit formula for the Alexander polynomial of twisted torus knots. Our approach utilizes a presentation of the knot group of twisted torus knots combined with Fox's free differential calculus. As applications, we provide a lower bound for the genus of certain families of twisted torus knots and identify families of twisted torus knots that are not $L$-space knots.</description>

      <title>Topological expanders, coarse geometry and thick embeddings of complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the topological expansion properties of bounded degree simplicial complexes in terms of a family of sublinear functions, in analogy with the separation profile of Benjamini-Schramm-Tim\'ar for classical expansion of bounded degree graphs. We prove that, like the separation profile, these new invariants are monotone under regular maps between complexes satisfying appropriate higher connectivity assumptions. In the dimension $1$ case, we recover the cutwidth profile of Huang-Hume-Kelly-Lam. We also prove the seemingly new result that any $1$-dimensional topological expander necessarily contains a graphical expander.
  In higher dimensions, we give full calculations of these new invariants for Euclidean spaces, which are natural analogues of waist and width-volume inequalities due to Gromov and Guth respectively. We present several other methods of obtaining upper bounds including na\"ive (yet useful) direct product and fibring theorems, and show how lower bounds can be obtained via thick embeddings of complexes, in analogy with previous work of Barrett-Hume. Using this, we find lower bounds for $k$-expansion of $(k+1)$-fold horocyclic products of trees, and for rank $k$ symmetric spaces of non-compact type. As a further application, we prove that for every $k\geq 2$ there is no coarse embedding (and more generally, no regular map) from the $k$-fold horocyclic product of $3$-regular trees to either any product $(\mathbb{H}^2)^{k-2}\times H \times D$ where $\mathbb{H}^2$ is the real hyperbolic plane, $H$ is a bounded degree hyperbolic graph and $D$ is a doubling metric space, or to any symmetric space whose non-compact factor has corank (dimension minus rank) is strictly less than $k$.</description>

      <title>Classification of hyperbolic Dehn fillings I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $2$-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifold. By the work of Thurston, the product of the derivatives of the holonomies of core geodesics of each Dehn filling of $M$ is an invariant of it. In this paper, we classify Dehn fillings of $M$ with sufficiently large coefficients using this invariant. Further, for any given two Dehn fillings of $M$ (with sufficiently larger coefficients), if their aforementioned invariants are the same, it is shown their complex volumes are the same as well.</description>

      <title>Master Teapots and Entropy Algorithms for the Mandelbrot Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an analogue of W. Thurston's "Master teapot" for each principal vein in the Mandelbrot set, and generalize geometric properties known for the corresponding object for real maps. In particular, we show that eigenvalues outside the unit circle move continuously, while we show "persistence" for roots inside the unit circle. As an application, this shows that the outside part of the corresponding "Thurston set" is path connected. In order to do this, we define a version of kneading theory for principal veins, and we prove the equivalence of several algorithms that compute the core entropy.</description>
