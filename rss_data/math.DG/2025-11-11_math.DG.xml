      <title>The Stolz' positive scalar curvature sequence for G-proper manifolds and depth-1 pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis revolves around the Stolz' positive scalar curvature sequence: in particular adapted to the context of (G, F)-spaces, i.e. proper G-spaces with isotropy groups belonging to a family F of subgroups of G, and to that of manifolds with non-isolated singularities. In both cases, the sequence is studied for appropriate classes of metrics with positive scalar curvature, and it is shown how the Stolz R-groups have a strict dependence on the 2-skeleton. This latter result will then be used in the (G, F) framework to establish an isomorphism between the R-groups for spaces having isomorphic fundamental functors, a suitable generalization of the fundamental group. A universal space is also introduced, where universal means that each space with this characterization admit a map with values in it, inducing isomorphisms at the level of R-groups. Subsequently, the mapping of the Stolz sequence to the Higson-Roe surgery sequence for singular spaces with (L, G)-singularities will be studied. Specifically, a version of the delocalized APS-index theorem, which makes use of localization algebras, will be employed. This includes a description of K-theory for graded $C^{*}-algebras$, which will be introduced for Real $C^{*}-algebras$, with the advantage of simultaneously including both the real and complex case. Finally, as an application of these results, the wedge index difference homomorphism is studied in the singular context. This homomorphism, besides serving as an obstruction for two well-adapted wedge metrics to be concordant, is used to provide a lower bound on the rank of the structure group of such positive scalar curvature metrics, namely the bordism group $Pos_*^{spin,(L,G)}$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Gradient Shrinking Ricci Solitons with Bach-like Flatness and Related Variational Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05774v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Bach tensor in four dimensions can be expressed as a linear combination of two independent, symmetric, divergence-free, quadratic in curvature tensors U and V. Several classification results for gradient-shrinking Ricci solitons have been obtained under the assumption that the Bach tensor vanishes. We define a Bach-like tensor to be any other linear combination of U and V. We prove that, except along the Bach line, the vanishing of a Bach-like tensor forces a four-dimensional complete gradient-shrinking Ricci soliton to be either Einstein or isometric to the Gaussian soliton. Finally, we show that Bach-like tensors arise as Euler-Lagrange equations of a two-parameter family of quadratic curvature functionals and compute the corresponding first and second variation formulas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a limit curve theorem for incomplete metric spaces. Our main application is to Sormani and Vegas' null distance, where our results give strong control on the Lorentzian lengths of limit curves. We also show that regular cosmological time functions and the surface function of a Cauchy surface in a globally hyperbolic manifold define such a null distance.</description>

      <title>Bi-forms Approach to Potential Functions in Information Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrast functions play a fundamental role in information geometry, providing a means for generating the geometric structures of a statistical manifold: a pseudo-Riemannian metric and a pair of torsion-free conjugate affine connections. Conventional contrast-based approaches become indeed insufficient within settings where torsion is naturally present, such as quantum information geometry. This paper introduces contrast bi-forms, a generalisation of contrast functions that systematically encode metric and connection data, allowing for arbitrary affine connections regardless of torsion. It will be shown that they provide a unified framework for statistical potentials, offering new insights into the inverse problem in information geometry. As an example, we consider teleparallel manifolds, where torsion is intrinsic to the geometry, and show how bi-forms naturally accommodate these structures.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of topological entropy along the Ricci flow near a hyperbolic metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2004, Manning showed that the topological entropy of the geodesic flow of a closed surface of non-constant negative curvature is strictly decreasing along the normalized Ricci flow, and he asked if an analogous result holds in higher dimensions for metrics in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic metric. In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question. Namely, we show that the topological entropy of the geodesic flow of a closed Riemannian manifold that carries a hyperbolic metric is indeed strictly decreasing along the normalized Ricci flow starting from a metric of variable negative sectional curvature sufficiently close to the hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds with torse-forming axes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study orientable hypersurfaces $N$ in Riemannian manifolds $(M,\langle , \rangle)$ for which the inner product $\langle U, \mathcal{V} \rangle$ is constant, where $U$ is the unit normal vector field to $N$ and $\mathcal{V}$ is a globally defined torse-forming vector field on $M$, called the axis of $N$. When $\mathcal{V}$ is a unit torse-forming vector field, $N$ becomes a constant angle hypersurface with axis $\mathcal{V}$, and we classify such hypersufaces. After that, the case when $\mathcal{V}$ is a torqued vector field is considered and a corresponding classification is given.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Internal Tangent Space to a Point of the Orbit Space of a Manifold under a Proper Lie Group Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diffeological space is a set equipped with a smooth structure, known as a diffeology, which allows us to extend certain notions from manifolds to these more general spaces. We study a generalized notion of tangent space to a point of a manifold, namely the internal tangent space to a point of a diffeological space. In particular, we study these internal tangent spaces when the diffeological space in question is the orbit space of a manifold acted upon by a proper Lie group action. We provide a useful description for an arbitrary internal tangent space to a point of such an orbit space and then, in the culmination of our work, show that the internal tangent space to a point of an orbit space, viewed as a diffeological space, is isomorphic to the stratified tangent space to the same point, when the orbit space is viewed as a stratified space with the well-known orbit type stratification.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $\mathcal{D}$ is a collection of $k$ nontrivial partitions of a positive integer $d$ satisfying the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, and if $k$ is greater than one plus the minimum length among the partitions in $\mathcal{D}$, then $\mathcal{D}$ is realizable as the branch data of a rational map $f \colon S^2 \to S^2$. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Zheng [\textit{Topology Appl.} \textbf{153} (2006), no.~12, 2124--2134].</description>

      <title>The complex Monge-Ampere equation and an application to uniformisation of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a complete noncompact K\"ahler surface with positive and bounded sectional curvature is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^2$. This result confirms a special case of Yau's conjecture that a complete noncompact K\"ahler $n$-manifold with positive holomorphic bisectional curvature is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n$. In contrast to all known results on Yau's conjecture, we do not need additional assumptions on the global/asymptotic geometry of the K\"ahler surface apart from completeness. Towards this end, we prove that the integral of the square of the Ricci form of a complete K\"ahler surface with positive sectional curvature is finite. The work of Chen and Zhu shows that this latter result implies that the surface is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^2$ . The main new idea is the construction of a Lipschitz continuous plurisubharmonic weight function with finite Monge-Amp\`ere mass. This weight function is obtained by solving a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we associated to $\textrm{SU(3)}$, $\mathrm{G}_2$, and $\textrm{Spin(7)}$-structures minimal left ideals for the Clifford algebras $\mathbb{R}_{0,6},\mathbb{R}_{0,7}$, and $\mathbb{R}_{0,8}$, respectively. In this paper, we continue to analyze the link between Berger's classification theorem and the structure theorem of minimal left ideals for Clifford algebras of signature $(p,q)$ by identifying $\mathrm{U}(n)$-structures with minimal left ideals for Clifford algebras of various signatures via the induced Kahler polynomial $P(\omega_{0})$ associated with the symplectic form $\omega_{0}$ that defines the $\mathrm{U}(n)$-structure as a stabilizer subgroup of $\mathrm{O}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Weakly-Weyl Finsler Metrics: A Generalized Approach to Sakaguchi's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of projective invariant Weyl metrics in this paper offers a fresh perspective, as we establish the characteristics of both weakly-Weyl and generalized weakly-Weyl Finsler metrics. We thoroughly examine the connections between these metrics and various projective invariants, highlighting their significance in the context of generalized Sakaguchi's Theorem, which states that every Finsler metric of scalar flag curvature is a GDW-metric. Additionally, we introduce several illustrative examples pertaining to this new class of projective invariant Finsler metrics. Specifically, we explore the category of weakly-Weyl spherically symmetric Finsler metrics in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Importantly, we demonstrate that the two classes weakly-Weyl and $W$-quadratic spherically symmetric Finsler metrics in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the study of homogeneous Lorentzian three-manifolds, we consider here the only class of examples which admit a four-dimensional group of isometries but are neither Lorentzian Bianchi-Cartan-Vranceanu spaces nor plane waves. We obtain an explicit description in global coordinates of these special homogeneous Lorentzian manifolds. We then prove that all such examples are non-gradient expanding Ricci solitons.</description>

After providing a complete description of the geometry of the ambient space, we perform the full classification of minimal and CMC helix surfaces in $\htt$, giving their explicit parametrizations. In addition, we investigate the constant angle spacelike and timelike surfaces for a Lorentzian metric on the Heisenberg group $H_3$ not treated before in the literature, first showing that such surfaces have constant Gaussian curvature and then obtaining their complete characterization.</description>

      <title>Killing (super)algebras for generalised spin manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of a Killing (super)algebra for a connection on a spinor bundle associated to a generalised spin structure on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of any signature. We are led naturally to include in the even subspace not only Killing vectors but also certain infinitesimal gauge transformations, and we show that the definition of the (super)algebra requires, in addition to the spinor connection and a Dirac current, a map to pair spinor fields into infinitesimal gauge transformations. We show that these (super)algebras are filtered subdeformations of (an analogue of) the Poincar\'e superalgebra extended by the \(R\)-symmetry algebra. By employing Spencer cohomology, we study such deformations from a purely algebraic point of view and, at least in the case of Lorentzian signature and high supersymmetry, identify the subclass of deformations to which the Killing superalgebras belong. Finally, we show that, with some caveats, one can reconstruct a supersymmetric background geometry from such a deformation as a homogeneous space on which the deformation is realised as a subalgebra of the Killing superalgebra.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and stochastic areas on complex partial flag manifolds with blocks of equal size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Brownian motion on complex partial flag manifolds with blocks of equal size as a matrix-valued diffusion from a Brownian motion on the unitary group. This construction leads to an explicit expression for the characteristic function of the joint distribution of the stochastic areas on these manifolds. The limit law of these stochastic areas is shown to be a multivariate Cauchy distribution with independent and identically distributed entries. By relating the area functionals on flag manifolds to the winding functional on the complex Stiefel manifold, we establish new results about simultaneous Brownian windings on the complex Stiefel manifold. To establish these results, this work introduces a new family of diffusions, which generalise both the Jacobi processes on the simplex and the Hermitian Jacobi processes.</description>

      <title>Black holes and black regions, horizons and barriers in Lorentzian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if S is a time-oriented null hypersurface of a Lorentzian n-manifold (M, g), the causal world-lines, which intersect transversally S and are time-oriented in a compatible way, cross the hypersurface all in the same direction, the other being forbidden. Even if it is known that a smooth event horizon (in the sense of Penrose, Hawking and Ellis) is a null hypersurface and has the above semi-permeability property, at the best of our knowledge, it was not known so far that the latter is a mere consequence of the former. Our result leads to the concepts of barriers (= null hypersurfaces separating the space-time into disjoint regions) and black regions (= time-oriented regions bounded by barriers). These objects naturally include (smooth) event horizons and (smoothly bounded) black holes. Since barriers are defined by two simple properties -- the merely local property of "nullity" combined with the global property of "separating the space-time" -- we expect they may be used to simplify computations for locating static and/or dynamic horizons in numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Explicit Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff Radii in Special Banach--Malcev Algebras of Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06357v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit convergence radii for the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) series in special Banach--Malcev algebras of shifts-those embeddable into a Banach alternative algebra. Under the continuity estimate $\|[x,y]\|\leq B\|x\|\|y\|$, the series converges absolutely whenever $B(\|x\|+\|y\|)&lt;1/(4K)$, where $K\geq1$ bounds the absolute BCH coefficients. The constant $1/(4K)$ stems from a Catalan-number majorization and is sharp in the exponential-weight model. We compute $B$ explicitly for operator, exponential, polynomial, damped, and tree-like shift algebras, including the non-Lie split-octonionic (Zorn) algebra ($B=2$, $\rho=1/(8K)$). All results require the speciality assumption; the framework does not apply to general Malcev algebras. Geometrically, $\rho=1/(4KB)$ is the analyticity radius of the induced Moufang loop; numerically, it governs stability of BCH-type integrators.</description>

      <title>A general comparison principle for the pluripotential complex Monge-Amp\`ere flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a comparison principle for the pluripotential complex Monge-Amp\`ere flows for the right-hand side of the form $dt \wedge d\mu$ where $d\mu$ is dominated by a Monge-Amp\`ere measure of a bounded plurisubharmonic function. As a consequence, we obtain the uniqueness of the weak solution to the pluripotential Cauchy-Dirichlet problem. We also study the long-term behavior of the solution under some assumption.</description>

Abstract: We study the intersection form $F_X$ on the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$ of a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ of dimension $n$. Although the structure of $F_X$ is relatively well understood in dimensions two and three, much less is known for $n \geq 4$. We investigate the fundamental properties of $F_X$ in higher dimensions and discuss several applications to birational geometry. Finally, we present a number of open problems concerning the relationship between birational invariants and topological invariants of K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>On Driftless Systems with m controls and 2m or 2m-1 states that are Flat by Pure Prolongation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that no tractable necessary and sufficient conditions exist for determining whether a system is, in general, differentially flat. However, specific cases do provide such conditions. For instance, driftless systems with two inputs have known necessary and sufficient conditions. For driftless systems with three or more inputs, the available conditions are only sufficient. This paper presents new findings on determining whether a system with m inputs and $2m$ or $2m-1$ states is flat by pure prolongation, a specific subclass of differential flatness. While this condition is more restrictive than general differential flatness, the algorithm for computing flat outputs remains remarkably simple, and the verification requirements are relatively lenient. Moreover, the conditions proposed in this work broaden the class of systems recognized as differentially flat, as our sufficient condition differs from existing criteria.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Limit of Growing Gravitational Wave Memory from Sources in the Early Universe and Astrophysical Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt;1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.</description>

      <title>Contact Wasserstein Geodesics for Non-Conservative Schr\"odinger Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06856v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge provides a principled framework for modeling stochastic processes between distributions; however, existing methods are limited by energy-conservation assumptions, which constrains the bridge's shape preventing it from model varying-energy phenomena. To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schr\"odinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric. We validate our framework on tasks including manifold navigation, molecular dynamics predictions, and image generation, demonstrating its practical benefits and versatility.</description>

Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a small bundle gerbe we mean a bundle gerbe in the sense of Murray defined on a smooth, finite-dimensional, fibre bundle over a manifold. We construct such gerbes over compact oriented aspherical 3-manifolds, as well as in higher dimensions, generalizing the construction of decomposable bundle gerbes in earlier work with Singer. For these small bundle gerbes there is a direct index map given in terms of either fibrewise pseudodifferential operators, or more conveniently fibrewise semiclassical smoothing operators, twisted by the simplicial line bundle. We prove the Atiyah-Singer type theorem that this realizes the push-forward into twisted K-theory. We also give an application via the index of projective families of Spin_c Dirac operators, to show the existence of obstructions to metrics with large positive scalar curvature.</description>

Abstract: Generalizing previous results of Arezzo-Pacard-Singer, Seyyedali-Sz\'ekelyhidi and Hallam, we prove the invariance under smooth blowups of the class of weighted extremal K\"ahler manifolds, modulo a log-concavity assumption on the first weight. Through recent work of Di Nezza-Jubert-Lahdili and Han-Liu, this is obtained as a consequence of a general uniform coercivity estimate for the (relative, weighted) Mabuchi energy on the blowup, which applies more generally to any equivariant resolution of singularities of Fano type of a compact K\"ahler klt space whose Mabuchi energy is assumed to be coercive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the action on currents and differential forms on compact Riemannian manifolds under $C^0$-limits of diffeomorphisms. Using tools from geometric analysis, measure theory, and homotopy theory, we establish several convergence theorems. We give conditions under which pullbacks of differential forms by a sequence of smooth diffeomorphisms converge uniformly (in the $C^0$ norm), and pushforwards of currents by smooth diffeomorphisms exhibit weak-* convergence. We prove that pushforwards of rectifiable currents are convergent in the flat norm, a property of particular interest in the study of singular geometric objects. These stability findings offer tools for the study of geometric structures, including applications to the stability of groups of symplectomorphisms, cosymplectomorphisms, volume-preserving transformations, and contact transformations under $C^0$ perturbations. We highlight applicability in measure theory and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>The paint group Tits Satake theory of hyperbolic symmetric spaces: the distance function, paint invariants and discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper, which is partially a review, but also contains several completely new results, aims at presenting, in a unified mathematical framework, a complex and articulated lore regarding non-compact symmetric spaces, with negative curvature, whose isometry group is a non-compact, real simple Lie group. All such manifolds are Riemannian normal manifolds, according to Alekseevsky's definition, in the sense that they are metrically equivalent to a solvable Lie group manifold. This identification provides a vision in which, on one side one can derive quite explicit and challenging formulae for the unique distance function between points of the manifold, on the other one, one can organize the entire set of the available manifolds in universality classes distinguished by their common Tits Satake submanifold and, correspondingly, by their non-compact rank. The members of the class are distinguished by their different Paint Groups, the latter notion having been introduced by two of the present authors in an earlier collaboration. In relation to the construction of neural networks, these mathematical structures offer unique possibilities of replacing ad hoc activation functions with the naturally defined non-linear operations that relate Lie algebras to Lie Groups and vice-versa. The Paint Group invariants offer new tokens both to construct algorithms and inspect (hopefully to control) their working. A conspicuous part of the paper is devoted to the study and systematic construction of parabolic/elliptic discrete subgroups of the Lie groups SO(r,r+q), in view of discretization and/or tessellations of the space to which data are to be mapped. Furthermore, it is shown how the ingredients of Special K\"ahler Geometry and the c-map, well known in the supergravity literature, provide a unified classification scheme of the relevant Tits Satake universality classes with non-compact rank r&lt;5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest among geometers in $f$-structures of K. Yano is due to the study of topology and dynamics of contact foliations and generalized A. Weinstein conjectures. Weak metric $f$-structures, introduced by the author and R. Wolak as a generalization of Hermitian structure, as well as $f$-structure allow for a fresh perspective on the classical theory. An important case of such manifolds, which is locally a twisted product, is a weak $\beta f$-Kenmotsu manifold defined as a generalization of K. Kenmotsu's concept. In this paper, the concept of the $\ast$-Ricci tensor of S. Tashibana is adapted to weak metric $f$-manifolds, the interaction of $\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci soliton with the weak $\beta f$-Kenmotsu structure is studied and new characteristics of $\eta$-Einstein metrics are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our outcome is structured in the following sequence: (1) a general result for indefinite Finslerian manifolds with boundary $(M,L)$ showing the equivalence between local and infinitesimal (time, light or space) convexities for the boundary $\partial M$, (2) for any cone structure $(M,\mathcal{C})$ which is globally hyperbolic with timelike boundary, the equivalence among: (a) the boundary $\partial M$ is lightconvex, (b) the interior $\mathring{M}$ is causally simple and (c) the space of the cone (null) geodesics $\mathcal{N}$ of $(\mathring{M},\mathcal{C})$ is Hausdorff, (3) in this case, the manifold structure of $\mathcal{N}$ is obtained explicitly in terms of elements in $\partial M$ and a smooth Cauchy hypersurface $S$, (4) the known results and examples about Hausdorfness of $\mathcal{N}$ are revisited and extended, leading to the notion of {\em causally simple spacetime with $T_2$-lightspace} as a step in the causal ladder below global hyperbolicity.
  The results are significant for relativistic (Lorentz) spacetimes and the writing allows one either to be introduced in Finslerian technicalities or to skip them. In particular, asymptotically AdS spacetimes become examples where the $C^{1,1}$ conformal extensions at infinity yield totally lightgeodesic boundaries, and all the results above apply.</description>

      <title>On geometry of $Q^{(2k)}_g$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of current article is to study the geometry of $Q$-curvature. For simplicity, we start with a simple model: a complete and conformal metric $g=e^{2u}|dx|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming that the metric $g$ has non-negative $nth$-order $Q$-curvature and non-negative scalar curvature, we show that the Ricci curvature is non-negative. If we further assume that the isoperimetric ratio near the end is positive, we show that the growth rate of $kth$ elementary symmetric function $\sigma_k(g)$ of Ricci curvature over geodesic ball of radius $r$ is at most polynomial in $r$ with order $n-2k$ for all $1 \leq k \leq \frac{n-2}{2}$. Similarly, we are able to show that the same growth control holds for $2kth$-order $Q$-curvature. Finally, we show that for $k=1$ or $2$, the gap theorems for $Q^{(2k)}_g$ hold true.</description>

      <title>BRIDGES Lectures: Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures</title>

Abstract: The BRIDGES meeting in gauge theory, extremal structures, and stability was held June 2024 at l'Institut d'\'Etudes Scientifiques de Carg\`ese in Corsica, organized by Daniele Faenzi, Eveline Legendre, Eric Loubeau, and Henrique S\'a Earp. The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but related lecture series by Oscar Garc\'ia Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent Manivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the lecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on "Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures". Some assistance in the preparation of these notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer school. See the Comments field for more information.
  The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric flows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows of such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows, and consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci flow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence and uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of geometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and survey several different geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In particular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Laplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude with a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and Gianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit STE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. Extending the results of Pigazzini--Toda (2025), we show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection $\nabla^C$ is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed K\"unneth components of its calibration class. The bound depends only on the mixed class $[\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}}\in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$, hence is topological and independent of the chosen product metric. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of $\mathfrak{hol}_p^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^C)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via a new isoparametric foliation in $\mathbb{S}^n(1) \times \mathbb{S}^n(1)$, we find many new area-minimizing cones by applying Lawlor's curvature criterion, especially codimension-two area-minimizing cones in $\mathbb{R}^{2n+2}$ for $n\geq 63$. This new isoparametric foliation is a further restriction of the Ferus-Karcher-M\"unzner isoparametric foliation to $\mathbb{S}^n(1) \times \mathbb{S}^n(1) \subset \mathbb{S}^{2n+1}(\sqrt{2})$, which can also be defined on general $\mathbb{S}^n(a) \times \mathbb{S}^n(b)(a&gt;0,b&gt;0)$, and it extends the recent classification results of F. Urbano for $n=2$.</description>

Abstract: Algebraists asked whether or not an operator on the module of smooth sections of the tangent bundle over the commutative ring of smooth functions of a smooth (orientable) manifold (can be any piece of a compact or a complete manifold) can be characterized by two axioms.

      <title>Toric separable geometries and extremal K\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the framework of (local) toric separable geometries, where toric separable K\"ahler geometries come in families, each uniquely determined by an underlying factorization structure. This unifying framework captures all known explicit Calabi-extremal toric K\"ahler metrics, previously constructed through diverse methods, as two distinct families corresponding to the simplest factorization structures: the product Segre and the Veronese factorization structure. Crucially, the moduli of typical factorization structures has a positive dimension, revealing an immensely rich and previously untapped landscape of toric separable geometries. The scalar curvature of toric separable geometries is computed explicitly, necessary conditions for the PDE governing extremality are derived, and new extremal metrics are obtained systematically. In particular, for a $2m$-dimensional toric separable geometry, solutions of the PDE are necessarily $m$-tuples of rational functions of one variable belonging to an at most $(m+2)$-dimensional real vector space and whose denominators are determined by the factorization structure. Toric separable geometries serve as a separation of variables technique and are well-suited for the analytic study of geometric PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09350v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homology of the free and the based loop space of a compact globally symmetric space can be studied through explicit cycles. We use cycles constructed by Bott and Samelson and by Ziller to study the string topology coproduct and the Chas-Sullivan product on compact symmetric spaces. We show that the Chas-Sullivan product for compact symmetric spaces is highly non-trivial for any rank and we prove that there are many non-nilpotent classes whose powers correspond to the iteration of closed geodesics. Moreover, we show that the based string topology coproduct is trivial for compact symmetric spaces of higher rank and we study the implications of this result for the string topology coproduct on the free loop space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction has an analogous version for cosymplectic manifolds. In this paper we extend this cosymplectic reduction to the context of groupoids. Moreover, we prove how in the case of an algebroid associated to a cosymplectic groupoid, the integration commutes with the reduction (analogously to what happens in Poisson geometry). On the other hand, we show how the cosymplectic reduction of a groupoid induces a symplectic reduction on a canonical symplectic subgroupoid. Finally, we study what happens to the multiplicative Chern class associated with the $S^1$-central extensions of the reduced groupoid.</description>

Abstract: We provide proofs of two theorems stated by Massey in 1961, concerning the obstructions to finding complex structures on real vector bundles. In addition, we determine the second obstruction to a complex structure on a rank six orientable real vector bundle. The obstructions are fractional parts of integral Stiefel-Whitney classes, and a fourth of an appropriate combination of Pontryagin, Chern, and Euler classes.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative cross-curvature in infinite dimensions: synthetic definition and spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative cross-curvature (NNCC) is a geometric property of a cost function defined on a product space that originates in optimal transportation and the Ma-Trudinger-Wang theory. Motivated by applications in optimization, gradient flows and mechanism design, we propose a variational formulation of nonnegative cross-curvature on c-convex domains applicable to infinite dimensions and nonsmooth settings. The resulting class of NNCC spaces is closed under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and for this class, we extend many properties of classical nonnegative cross-curvature: stability under generalized Riemannian submersions, characterization in terms of the convexity of certain sets of c-concave functions, and in the metric case, it is a subclass of positively curved spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. One of our main results is that Wasserstein spaces of probability measures inherit the NNCC property from their base space. Additional examples of NNCC costs include the Bures-Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao squared distances, the Hellinger-Kantorovich squared distance (in some cases), the relative entropy on probability measures, and the 2-Gromov-Wasserstein squared distance on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to proving Allard-Michael-Simon-type $L^p$-Sobolev inequalities $(p&gt;1)$ with explicit constants in the setting of Euclidean minimal submanifolds of arbitrary codimension. Our results require separate discussions for the cases $p\geq 2$ and $1&lt;p&lt;2$, respectively. In particular, for $p\geq 2$, we obtain an asymptotically sharp and codimension-free Sobolev constant. Our argument is based on optimal mass transport theory on Euclidean submanifolds and also provides an alternative, unified proof of the recent isoperimetric inequalities of Brendle (J. Amer. Math. Soc., 2021) and Brendle and Eichmair (Notices Amer. Math. Soc., 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To a bicomplex one can associate two natural filtrations, the column and row filtrations, and then two associated spectral sequences. This can be generalized to $N$-multicomplexes. We present a family of model category structures on the category of $N$-multicomplexes where the weak equivalences are the morphisms inducing a quasi-isomorphism at a fixed page $r$ of the first spectral sequence and at a fixed page $s$ of the second spectral sequence. Such weak equivalences arise naturally in complex geometry. In particular, the model structures presented here establish a basis for studying homotopy types of almost and generalized complex manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the systolic $S^1$-index of a convex body as the Fadell-Rabinowitz index of the space of generalized systoles associated with its boundary. We show that this index is a symplectic invariant. Using the systolic $S^1$-index, we introduce the notion of generalized Zoll convex bodies and prove that this definition coincides with the classical one when the convex body satisfies the uniqueness of systoles property, that is, when through every point passes at most one systole. Moreover, we show that generalized Zoll convex bodies can be characterized in terms of their Gutt-Hutchings capacities, and we prove that the space of generalized Zoll convex bodies is closed in the space of all convex bodies. As a corollary, we establish that if the interior of a convex body is symplectomorphic to the interior of a ball, then the convex body is generalized Zoll, and in particular Zoll if it satisfies the uniqueness of systoles property. Finally, we discuss several examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically large free semigroups in Zariski dense discrete subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected algebraic semisimple real Lie group with finite center and no compact factors, and let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of $G$. We show that $\Gamma$ contains free, finitely generated subsemigroups whose critical exponents are arbitrarily close to that of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, these subsemigroups are Zariski dense in $G$ and $P$-Anosov in the sense of Kassel--Potrie. This shows that no gap phenomenon holds for critical exponents of discrete subsemigroups of Lie groups, which is in contrast with Leuzinger's critical exponent gap theorem for infinite covolume discrete subgroups of Lie groups with Kazhdan's property (T), proven in 2003.
  As an application, we prove that the critical exponent is lower semicontinuous in the Chabauty topology, in the following sense: if a sequence of Zariski dense discrete subgroups $\{\Gamma_{n}\}$ of $G$ converges in the Chabauty topology to a Zariski dense discrete subgroup $\Gamma$, then $\liminf_{n \to \infty} \delta(\Gamma_{n}) \geq \delta(\Gamma)$.</description>

Abstract: The helicity, or asymptotic linking number, is a functional of exact volume-preserving vector fields on 3-manifolds, invariant under volume-preserving transformations. It is known to exhibit remarkable uniqueness properties: many invariant functionals reduce to functions of helicity. We examine how severely this uniqueness can fail. On integral homology spheres with the $C^{1}$-topology, the failure is extreme: for every $C^{1}$-open set of nonvanishing exact fields of fixed helicity, some other global dynamical invariant is continuous and non-constant in that set; the Ruelle invariant if some field is non-Anosov, and topological entropy otherwise. In particular, on the three-sphere, the Ruelle invariant is everywhere independent of helicity. This implies, in a very strong sense, a negative answer to a question of Arnold and Khesin on the somewhere density of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, when considered for the $C^1$-topology. On arbitrary three-manifolds, we also answer the question in the negative using local rather than global invariants.</description>

      <title>8D conformal gravity with Einstein sector, and its relation to the Q-curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first streamline the construction of the unique six-dimensional conformal gravity action found by L\"u, Pang and Pope, that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations. We then prove that there exists a unique eight-dimensional conformal gravity action that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations, and explicitly build the corresponding action. Finally, we relate these results to Branson's Q-curvature and the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor, to conclude that on every even-dimensional space there exists a unique -- up to boundary terms -- conformally-invariant gravity theory that is extremised by Einstein metrics.</description>
