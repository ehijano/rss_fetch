      <title>Unsteady Navier-Stokes Equations On A Stationary Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a fully discrete numerical method for the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations on a smooth closed stationary surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We use the surface finite element method (SFEM) with a generalized Taylor-Hood finite element pair $\mathrm{\mathbf{P}}_{k_u}$/$\mathrm{P}_{k_{pr}}$/$\mathrm{P}_{k_{\lambda}}$, where we enforce the tangential condition of the velocity field weakly, by introducing an extra Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$. Depending on the richness of the finite element space involving this extra Lagrange multiplier we present a full discrete stability and error analysis. For the velocity, we establish optimal $L^{2}(a_h)$-norm bounds ($a_h$ - an energy norm) when $k_\lambda=k_u$ and suboptimal with respect to the geometric approximation error when $k_{\lambda} = k_u-1$ (optimal when \emph{super-parametric finite elements} are used). For the pressure, optimal $L^2(L^2)$-norm error bounds are established when $k_\lambda=k_u$. Assuming further regularity assumptions for our continuous problem, we are also able to show optimal convergence (using \emph{super-parametric finite elements} again) when $k_\lambda=k_u-1$. Numerical simulations that confirm the established theory are provided, along with a comparative analysis against a penalty approach.</description>

      <title>A Nitsche method for Navier--Stokes/generalized poroelasticity interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-dependent coupled Navier--Stokes/generalized poroelastic flow problem and propose a unified and monolithic finite element discretization based on implicit time stepping. To handle the fluid-structure interface we employ a Nitsche-type formulation. The resulting discrete problem is shown to be well-posed using the theory of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) and the Banach fixed-point theorem. We prove stability and derive a priori error estimates for the fully discrete scheme. The stability and convergence of the method are ensured by a properly chosen penalty parameter independent of the mesh size. Numerical tests are presented to confirm the theoretical convergence rates and to illustrate the ability of the method to capture the coupled dynamics accurately.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric Interpolation Based Approach for Second Order Fredholm Integro-Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A trigonometric interpolation algorithm for non-periodic functions has been recently proposed and applied to study general ordinary differential equation (ODE). This paper enhances the algorithm to approximate functions in $2$-dim space. Performance of the enhanced algorithm is expected to be similar as in $1$-dim case and achieve accuracy aligned with the smoothness of the target function, which is confirmed by numerical examples.
  As an application, the $2$-dim trigonometric interpolation method is used to develop an algorithm for the solution of a second order Fredholm integro-differential equation (FIDE). There are several advantages of the algorithm. First of all, it converges quickly and high accuracy can be achieved with a moderate size of grid points; Secondly, it can effectively address singularities of kernel functions and work well with general boundary conditions. Finally, it can be enhanced to copy with other IDE such as Volterra IDE or IDE with high order ODE component. The tests conducted in this paper include various boundary conditions with both continuous kernels and integrable ones with singularity. Decent performance is observed across all covered scenarios with a moderate size of grid points.</description>

      <title>Generalized Plane Wave quasi-Trefftz spaces for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) models for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media are relevant for many applications. We will discuss numerical methods tailored for tackling problems governed by these variable-coefficient PDEs. Trefftz methods rely, in broad terms, on the idea of approximating solutions to PDEs via Galerkin methods using basis functions that are exact solutions of the PDE, making explicit use of information about the ambient medium. However, wave propagation in inhomogeneous media is modeled by PDEs with variable coefficients, and in general no exact solutions are available. Quasi-Trefftz methods have been introduced, in the case of the Helmholtz equation, to address this problem: they rely instead on high-order approximate solutions constructed locally. We will discuss basis of Generalized Plane Waves, a particular kind of quasi-Trefftz functions, and how their construction can be related to the construction of polynomial quasi-Trefftz bases.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic finite difference scheme for anisotropic diffusion equations: preserving the discrete maximum principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hyperbolic system approach is proposed for robust computation of anisotropic diffusion equations that appear in quasineutral plasmas. Though the approach exhibits merits of high extensibility and accurate flux computation, the monotonicity of the scheme for anisotropic diffusion cases has not been understood. In this study, the discrete maximum principle (DMP) of the hyperbolic system approach is analyzed and tested in various anisotropic diffusion cases. A mathematical analysis is conducted to obtain an optimal condition of an arbitrary parameter to guarantee the DMP, and numerical experiments reveal an adoptive selection of the parameter for DMP-preserving results. It is confirmed that, with an appropriate preconditioning matrix and parameter choice, the hyperbolic system approach preserves the DMP even with a linear discretization.</description>

      <title>Random Greedy Fast Block Kaczmarz Method for Solving Large-Scale Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To efficiently solve large scale nonlinear systems, we propose a novel Random Greedy Fast Block Kaczmarz method. This approach integrates the strengths of random and greedy strategies while avoiding the computationally expensive pseudoinversion of Jacobian submatrices, thus enabling efficient solutions for large scale problems. Our theoretical analysis establishes that the proposed method achieves linear convergence in expectation, with its convergence rates upper bound determined by the stochastic greedy condition number and the relaxation parameter. Numerical experiments confirm that when the Jacobian matrix exhibits a favorable stochastic greedy condition number and an appropriate relaxation parameter is selected, the algorithm convergence is significantly accelerated. As a result, the proposed method outperforms other comparable algorithms in both efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Gap-SBM: A New Conceptualization of the Shifted Boundary Method with Optimal Convergence for the Neumann and Dirichlet Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and mathematically analyze a new Shifted Boundary Method for the treatment of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, with provable optimal accuracy in the $L^2$- and $H^1$-norms of the error. The proposed method is built on three stages. First, the distance map between the SBM surrogate boundary and the true boundary is used to construct an approximation to the geometry of the gap between the two. Then, the representations of the numerical solution and test functions are extended from the surrogate domain to such gap. Finally, approximate quadrature formulas and specific shift operators are applied to integrate a variational formulation that also involves the fields extended in the gap. An extensive set of two-dimensional tests demonstrates the theoretical findings and the overall optimal performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Per-antenna power constraints: constructing Pareto-optimal precoders with cubic complexity under non-negligible noise conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precoding matrix construction is a key element of the wireless signal processing using the multiple-input and multiple-output model. It is established that the problem of global throughput optimization under per-antenna power constraints belongs, in general, to the class of monotonic optimization problems, and is unsolvable in real-time. The most widely used real-time baseline is the suboptimal solution of Zero-Forcing, which achieves a cubic complexity by discarding the background noise coefficients. This baseline, however, is not readily adapted to per-antenna power constraints, and performs poorly if background noise coefficients are not negligible. In this paper, we are going to present a computational algorithm which constructs a precoder that is SINR multiobjective Pareto-optimal under per-antenna power constraints - with a complexity that differs from that of Zero-Forcing only by a constant factor. The algorithm has a set of input parameters, changing which skews the importance of particular user throughputs: these parameters make up an efficient parameterization of the entire Pareto boundary.</description>

      <title>Fast and Simple Multiclass Data Segmentation: An Eigendecomposition and Projection-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based machine learning has seen an increased interest over the last decade with many connections to other fields of applied mathematics. Learning based on partial differential equations, such as the phase-field Allen-Cahn equation, allows efficient handling of semi-supervised learning approaches on graphs. The numerical solution of the graph Allen-Cahn equation via a convexity splitting or the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, albeit being a widely used approach, requires the calculation of a graph Laplacian eigendecomposition and repeated projections over the unit simplex to maintain valid partitions. The computational efficiency of those methods is hence limited by those two bottlenecks in practice, especially when dealing with large-scale instances. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework combining a novel penalty-based reformulation of the segmentation problem, which ensures valid partitions (i.e., binary solutions) for appropriate parameter choices, with an eigendecomposition and projection-free optimization scheme, which has a small per-iteration complexity (by relying primarily on sparse matrix-vector products) and guarantees good convergence properties. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets related to data segmentation in networks and images demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves comparable or better accuracy than the CS and MBO methods while being significantly faster, particularly for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Condition number for finite element discretisation of nonlocal PDE systems with applications to biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the condition number for a system of coupled non-local reaction-diffusion-advection equations developed in the context of modelling normal and abnormal wound healing.
  Following a finite element discretisation of the coupled non-local system, we establish bounds for this condition number.
  We further discuss how model parameter choices affect the conditioning of the system. Finally, we discuss how the step size of the chosen time-stepping scheme and the spatial grid size of the finite element methods affect the bound for the condition number, while also suggesting possible parameter ranges that could keep the model well conditioned.</description>

      <title>Distributional Sensitivity Analysis: Enabling Differentiability in Sample-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two analytical formulae for estimating the sensitivity -- namely, the gradient or Jacobian -- at given realizations of an arbitrary-dimensional random vector with respect to its distributional parameters. The first formula interprets this sensitivity as partial derivatives of the inverse mapping associated with the vector of 1-D conditional distributions. The second formula, intended for optimization methods that tolerate inexact gradients, introduces a diagonal approximation that reduces computational cost at the cost of some accuracy. We additionally provide four second-order numerical algorithms to approximate both formulae when closed forms are unavailable. We performed verification and validation studies to demonstrate the correctness of these numerical algorithms and the effectiveness of the proposed formulae. A nuclear physics application showcases how our work enables uncertainty quantification and parameter inference for quantum correlation functions. Our approach differs from existing methods by avoiding the need for model fitting, knowledge of sampling algorithms, and evaluation of high-dimensional integrals. It is therefore particularly useful for sample-based inverse problems when the sampler operates as a black box or requires expensive physics simulations. Moreover, our method renders arbitrary sampling subroutines differentiable, facilitating their integration into programming frameworks for deep learning and automatic differentiation. Algorithmic details and code implementations are provided in this paper and in our open-source software DistroSA to enable reproducibility and further development.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete multi-to -one dimensional variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of semi-discrete variational problems that arise in economic matching and game theory, where agents with continuous attributes are matched to a finite set of outcomes with a one dimensional structure. Such problems appear in applications including Cournot-Nash equilibria, and hedonic pricing, and can be formulated as problems involving optimal transport between spaces of unequal dimensions. In our discrete strategy space setting, we establish analogues of results developed for a continuum of strategies in \cite{nenna2020variational}, ensuring solutions have a particularly simple structure under certain conditions. This has important numerical consequences, as it is natural to discretize when numerically computing solutions. We leverage our results to develop efficient algorithms for these problems which scale significantly better than standard optimal transport solvers, particularly when the number of discrete outcomes is large, provided our conditions are satisfied. We also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for these algorithms. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by solving a range of numerical examples; in many of these our new solvers outperform alternatives by a considerable margin.</description>

      <title>A Nystr\"{o}m Method for Scattering by a Two-layered Medium with a Rough Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02339v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with problems of scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by a two-layered medium with a non-locally perturbed boundary (called a rough boundary in this paper) in two dimensions, where a Dirichlet or impedance boundary condition is imposed on the boundary. The two-layered medium is composed of two unbounded media with different physical properties and the interface between the two media is considered to be a planar surface. We formulate the scattering problems considered as boundary value problems and prove the result of the well-posedness of each boundary value problem by utilizing the integral equation method associated with the two-layered Green function. Moreover, we develop a Nystr\"{o}m method for numerically solving the boundary value problems considered, based on the proposed integral equation formulations. We establish the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method with the convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the rough boundary. It is worth noting that in establishing the well-posedness of the boundary value problems as well as the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method, an essential role is played by the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the two-layered Green function for small and large arguments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the Nystr\"{o}m method.</description>

      <title>Solving multiscale dynamical systems by deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale dynamical systems, modeled by high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with wide-ranging characteristic timescales, arise across diverse fields of science and engineering, but their numerical solvers often encounter severe efficiency bottlenecks. This paper introduces a novel DeePODE method, which consists of an Evolutionary Monte Carlo Sampling method (EMCS) and an efficient end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) to predict multiscale dynamical systems. We validate this finding across dynamical systems from ecological systems to reactive flows, including a predator-prey model, a power system oscillation, a battery electrolyte thermal runaway, and turbulent reaction-diffusion systems with complex chemical kinetics. The method demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, allowing pre-trained DNN models to accurately predict the behavior in previously unseen scenarios, largely due to the delicately constructed dataset. While theoretical guarantees remain to be established, empirical evidence shows that DeePODE achieves the accuracy of implicit numerical schemes while maintaining the computational efficiency of explicit schemes. This work underscores the crucial relationship between training data distribution and neural network generalization performance. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning approaches in modeling complex dynamical systems across scientific and engineering domains.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Oracle: A general-purpose Riemannian optimizer to solve nearness problems in matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extremely versatile approach to address a large family of matrix nearness problems, possibly with additional linear constraints. Our method is based on splitting a matrix nearness problem into two nested optimization problems, of which the inner one can be solved either exactly or cheaply, while the outer one can be recast as an unconstrained optimization task over a smooth real Riemannian manifold. We observe that this paradigm applies to many matrix nearness problems of practical interest appearing in the literature, thus revealing that they are equivalent in this sense to a Riemannian optimization problem. We also show that the objective function to be minimized on the Riemannian manifold can be discontinuous, thus requiring regularization techniques, and we give conditions for this to happen. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our method by implementing it for a number of matrix nearness problems that are relevant for applications and are currently considered very demanding in practice. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our method often greatly outperforms its predecessors, including algorithms specifically designed for those particular problems.</description>

      <title>Changing the ranking in eigenvector centrality of a weighted graph by small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider eigenvector centrality for the nodes of a graph and study the robustness (and stability) of this popular centrality measure. For a given weighted graph {\mathcal G} (both directed and undirected), we consider the associated weighted adjacency matrix A, which by definition is a non-negative matrix. The eigenvector centralities of the nodes of {\mathcal G} are the entries of the Perron eigenvector of A, which is the (positive) eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue with largest modulus. They provide a ranking of the nodes according to the corresponding centralities. An indicator of the robustness of eigenvector centrality consists in looking for a nearby perturbed graph \widetilde{\mathcal G}, with the same structure as {\mathcal G} (i.e., with the same vertices and edges), but with a weighted adjacency matrix \widetilde A such that the highest m entries (m \ge 2) of the Perron eigenvector of \widetilde A coalesce, making the ranking at the highest level ambiguous. To compute a solution to this matrix nearness problem, a nested iterative algorithm is proposed that makes use of a constrained gradient system of matrix differential equations in the inner iteration and a one-dimensional optimization of the perturbation size in the outer iteration. The proposed algorithm produces the {\em optimal} perturbation (i.e., the one with smallest Frobenius norm) of the A which causes the looked-for coalescence, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the graph. Our numerical experiments indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms more standard approaches based on algorithms for constrained optimization. The methodology is formulated in terms of graphs but applies to any nonnegative matrix, with potential applications in fields like population models, consensus dynamics, economics, etc.</description>

      <title>On positivity preservation of hybrid discontinuous Galerkin methods on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid finite element methods, particularly hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, are efficient numerical schemes for discretizing the diffusion equation, which encompasses two main physical principles: mass conservation and positivity preservation. While the former has been extensively analyzed in the literature, this paper investigates the latter. We state a theorem that guarantees the positivity of both the bulk and skeleton approximations to the primary unknown (concentration) and provide counterexamples for nonpositive discretizations. The theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An hp Multigrid Approach for Tensor-Product Space-Time Finite Element Discretizations of the Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a monolithic $hp$ space-time multigrid method for tensor-product space-time finite element discretizations of the Stokes equations. Geometric and polynomial coarsening of the space-time mesh is performed, and the entire algorithm is expressed through rigorous mathematical mappings. For the discretization, we use inf-sup stable pairs $\mathbb Q_{r+1}/\mathbb P_{r}^{\text{disc}}$ of elements in space and a discontinuous Galerkin (DG$(k)$) discretization in time with piecewise polynomials of order $k$. The key novelty of this work is the application of $hp$ multigrid techniques in space and time, facilitated and accelerated by the matrix-free capabilities of the deal$.$II library. While multigrid methods are well-established for stationary problems, their application in space-time formulations encounter unique challenges, particularly in constructing suitable smoothers. To overcome these challenges, we employ space-time cell and vertex star patch based Vanka smoothers. Extensive tests on high-performance computing platforms demonstrate the efficiency of our \( hp \) multigrid approach on problem sizes exceeding a trillion degrees of freedom (dofs), sustaining throughputs of hundreds of millions of dofs per second.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spectral element method for the stationary Stokes interface problem in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a higher-order spectral element method for the two-dimensional Stokes interface problem involving a piecewise constant viscosity coefficient. The proposed numerical formulation is based on least-squares formulation. The mesh is aligned with the interface, and the interface is completely resolved using blending element functions. The higher-order spectral element functions are nonconforming, and the same-order approximation is used for both velocity and pressure variables. The interface conditions are added to the minimizing functional in appropriate Sobolev norms. Stability and error estimates are proven. The proposed method is shown to be exponentially accurate in both velocity and pressure variables. The theoretical estimates are validated through various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>The Polynomial Set Associated with a Fixed Number of Matrix-Matrix Multiplications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing matrix polynomials $p(X)$, where $X$ is a large dense matrix, with as few matrix-matrix multiplications as possible. More precisely, let $\Pi_{2^{m}}^*$ represent the set of polynomials computable with $m$ matrix-matrix multiplications, but with an arbitrary number of matrix additions and scaling operations. We characterize this set through a tabular parameterization. By deriving equivalence transformations of the tabular representation, we establish new methods that can be used to construct elements of $\Pi_{2^{m}}^*$ and determine general properties of the set. The transformations allow us to eliminate variables and prove that the dimension is bounded by $m^2$, which is subsequently proven to be sharp, i.e., $\dim(\Pi_{2^m}^*)=m^2$. Consequently, we have identified a parameterization that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first minimal parameterization. We also conduct a study using computational tools from algebraic geometry to determine the largest degree $d$ such that all polynomials of that degree belong to $\Pi_{2^{m}}^*$, or its closure. In many cases, the computational setup is constructive in the sense that it can also be used to determine a specific evaluation scheme for a given polynomial.</description>

      <title>PDEformer-2: A Versatile Foundation Model for Two-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a central role in describing many physical phenomena. Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</description>

      <title>Generative Feature Training of Thin 2-Layer Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of functions by 2-layer neural networks with a small number of hidden weights based on the squared loss and small datasets. Due to the highly non-convex energy landscape, gradient-based training often suffers from local minima. As a remedy, we initialize the hidden weights with samples from a learned proposal distribution, which we parameterize as a deep generative model. To train this model, we exploit the fact that with fixed hidden weights, the optimal output weights solve a linear equation. After learning the generative model, we refine the sampled weights with a gradient-based post-processing in the latent space. Here, we also include a regularization scheme to counteract potential noise. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>3D-1D modelling of cranial mesh heating induced by low or medium frequency magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive implants, like cranial meshes or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency magnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic hyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the implant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. The proposed method is compared with measurements performed on a cranial mesh exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging. Then, it is applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial mesh is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment. The experimental comparison of the proposed method predictions and the measurement data shows an improved accuracy near the maximum temperature increase up to 25% with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The application of the proposed method applied to the magnetic hyperthermia case study leads to a prediction of the maximum temperature increase that is 10% lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds. At the same time, the proposed method corrects the underestimation of the thermal seeds in the regions where the electromagnetic power is not directly deposited and the temperature increase is only due to heat transfer. The proposed method leads to improved results with respect to previous approximations by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants.</description>

      <title>Faster Diffusion Models via Higher-Order Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K&gt;0$ is an arbitrary fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE. More broadly, our work develops a theoretical framework towards understanding the efficacy of high-order methods for accelerated sampling.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Arctic dual-channel sound speed profile based on random airgun signal</title>

Abstract: For the unique dual-channel sound speed profiles of the Canadian Basin and the Chukchi Plateau in the Arctic, based on the propagation characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles, an inversion method using refracted normal modes for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. This method proposes a dual-parameter representation method for dual-channel sound speed profiles, tailored to the characteristics of dual-channel sound speed profiles. A dispersion structure extraction method is proposed for the dispersion structure characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles. Combining the parameter representation method of sound speed profiles and the dispersion structure extraction method, an inversion method for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. For the common horizontal variation of sound speed profiles in long-distance acoustic propagation, a method for inverting horizontally varying dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. Finally, this article verifies the effectiveness of the dual-channel sound speed profile inversion method using the Arctic low-frequency long-range acoustic propagation experiment. Compared with previous sound speed profile inversion methods, the method proposed in this article has the advantages of fewer inversion parameters and faster inversion speed. It can be implemented using only a single hydrophone passively receiving random air gun signals, and it also solves the inversion problem of horizontal variation of sound speed profiles. It has significant advantages such as low cost, easy deployment, and fast computation speed.</description>

      <title>Acoustic source depth estimation method based on a single hydrophone in Arctic underwater</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the normal mode and ray theory, this article discusses the characteristics of surface sound source and reception at the surface layer, and explores depth estimation methods based on normal modes and rays, and proposes a depth estimation method based on the upper limit of modal frequency. Data verification is conducted to discuss the applicability and limitations of different methods. For the surface refracted normal mode waveguide, modes can be separated through warping transformation. Based on the characteristics of normal mode amplitude variation with frequency and number, the sound source depth can be estimated by matching amplitude information. Based on the spatial variation characteristics of eigenfunctions with frequency, a sound source depth estimation method matching the cutoff frequency of normal modes is proposed. For the deep Arctic sea, the sound ray arrival structure at the receiving end is obtained through the analysis of deep inversion sound ray trajectories, and the sound source depth can be estimated by matching the time difference of ray arrivals. Experimental data is used to verify the sound field patterns and the effectiveness of the sound source depth estimation method.</description>
