      <title>Hardware-Aware Design of a GNN-Based Hit Filtering Algorithm for the Belle II Level-1 Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle~II experiment operates at high luminosity, where an increasing beam-induced background imposes stringent demands on the hardware Level-1 trigger system, which must operate under tight latency and bandwidth constraints. To achieve online data reduction within the Level-1 trigger system, we have developed a hit-filtering algorithm based on the lightweight Interaction Network architecture. In this work, we present a hardware-aware model-compression workflow for this hit-filtering algorithm targeting deployment on FPGA devices within the Belle~II trigger system. The network is adapted to the detector and trigger conditions through model-size and graph-size reduction, low-precision (4 bit) fixed-point arithmetic, and unstructured pruning. We assess the resulting design using the total number of bit operations as a hardware-aware computational complexity metric. Using this metric, we identify a configuration that decreases this cost by more than two orders of magnitude relative to the full-precision reference implementation. This reduction is achieved while preserving performance close to the reference model in terms of hit efficiency and background rejection, as indicated by only a modest decrease in the AUC score from 97.4 to 96.8, evaluated on Belle~II collision data.</description>

      <title>Search for a new resonance decaying to a Higgs boson and a scalar boson in events with two b jets and two Z bosons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search is performed for a new resonance X decaying into either a pair of Higgs bosons (HH) or into a Higgs boson and a new scalar boson Y (HY), using proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. This study performs a comprehensive exploitation of the bbZZ events, encompassing the following decay topologies. One H candidate is identified through its decay into a bottom quark-antiquark pair, while the other H or the Y candidate is selected through its decay into a pair of Z bosons. One Z boson is required to decay leptonically and the other, to decay into a pair of quarks or neutrinos. Events of interest are categorized based on the Lorentz boosts of the hadronically decaying H and Z bosons. Machine-learning-based discriminants, together with the reconstructed resonance mass, are employed across the different categories to separate signal from backgrounds, and their corresponding distributions are included in a simultaneous fit. No significant deviations from the standard model predictions are observed. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the HH and HY production cross sections. For resonant HH production, the upper limit on the cross section of pp $\to$ HH production is 1 pb for a high-mass resonance. For HY production, the upper limit on the cross section of the process pp $\to$ X $\to$ bbZZ is approximately 5 fb for a high-mass resonance. This is comparable to the sensitivity achieved in other analyses, which focus on H decays to $\gamma\gamma$ or $\tau\tau$ and Y decays into a pair of bottom quarks or massive vector bosons.</description>

      <title>RadioAxion results on the search for axion dark matter under Gran Sasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report first results from RadioAxion, an underground experiment searching for axion dark matter through periodic modulations of radioisotope decays. We monitor the $\alpha$ decay of $^{241}\mathrm{Am}$ via its $59.5$ keV $\gamma$ line using a NaI detector installed at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, where cosmic-ray-induced systematics are strongly suppressed. We present the measured spectra and the corresponding time-series analysis. No evidence for a periodic modulation is observed. From these data we derive constraints on the axion decay constant in the axion mass range from $10^{-21}$ to $10^{-9}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Isospin dependence of nuclear EMC effect from global QCD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a new global QCD analysis of unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the nucleon from proton, deuteron and $A=3$ data, including recent measurements of $^3$He/$D$ and $^3$H/$D$ cross section ratios from the MARATHON experiment at Jefferson Lab. Simultaneously inferring the PDFs and nucleon off-shell corrections allows both to be determined consistently, without theoretical assumptions about the isospin dependence of nuclear effects. The analysis provides strong evidence for the need of nucleon off-shell corrections to describe the $A=3$ data, and suggests the presence of both isoscalar and isovector nuclear effects in $A \leq 3$ nuclei. We find that the extracted EMC ratios of nuclear to nucleon structure functions for $A=2$ and 3 differ from those naively extrapolated from heavy nuclei down to low $A$.</description>

      <title>Development and Application of an eV Neutron Polarization for Parity Violation Studies at CSNS Back-n Beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic enhancement of symmetry-breaking effects in neutron-nucleus resonances provides a sensitive testing ground for Time-Reversal Invariance Violation (TRIV). Exploiting this mechanism, the Neutron Optics Parity and Time Reversal Experiment (NOPTREX) seeks to elucidate the origin of the universe's baryon asymmetry. Critical to this effort is the precise measurement of Parity Violation (PV) asymmetries, which is essential to calibrate the nuclear parameters required for future TRIV experiments. To facilitate these studies, we developed an eV polarized neutron at the Back-n white neutron beamline of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). Neutron polarization is generated by an in-situ Spin-Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP) $^3$He filter. Spin manipulation is performed by an adiabatic spin flipper, while spin polarization is preserved over the flight path by a vacuum transport system equipped with a solenoidal guide field. Experiments successfully measured an asymmetry of approximately $7.8 \pm 2.4$ (stat.) $\pm 0.3$ (sys.) % at the 0.747 eV p-wave resonance of $^{139}$La. These results are in agreement with previous results on this resonance and validate the system's capability for PV measurements.</description>

      <title>Generating the fermion mass hierarchy at the TeV scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of theories to generate quark and lepton mass matrices where the scale of new physics is at the TeV scale, without inducing the large flavor and CP violating processes that are often thought to relegate the origin of flavor to energies above $\sim 100$ TeV. The models have new vector-like leptons and quarks, with mass mixings to each other and Yukawa couplings to light Standard Model fields encoded in "chains" reminiscent of dimensional deconstruction. Locality in the chains both generates the hierarchical Standard Model Yukawa matrices, and ensures that CP and flavor violating effects are small, even with the vector-like particles at the TeV scale. A simple extension also generates neutrino masses, whose tiny size is parametrically related to the square of the electron Yukawa coupling. We outline the essential features of these models, explain how fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles emerge, and explore their phenomenological implications. This framework can be tested both in the final run of the LHC as well as at possible future colliders operating at the 10 TeV scale, and we identify some of the distinctive experimental signatures associated with the production and decay of the new vector-like fermions.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon mediated Inelastic Dark Matter in Cosmology, Astrophysics and Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic discussion of the phenomenology of Dark Photon iDM (A$^{\prime}$iDM) where the Standard Model (SM) is extended by a dark sector containing an additional $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry under which all SM particles are neutral, and that couples to the SM hypercharge gauge boson through a kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$. The model contains two Majorana states $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ with $\delta=M_{\chi_2}-M_{\chi_1}&gt;0$ and $\chi_1$ the dark matter candidate, and a dark photon $A^{\prime}$ with mass $M_{A^{\prime}}$. Our analysis represents an integration of existing ones, where only specific benchmarks of the A$^{\prime}$iDM scenario have been discussed. In particular, we fix the $U(1)_D$ coupling $\alpha_D$ equal to the electromagnetic one $\alpha_{EM}$ and $\epsilon$ to its experimental upper bound, and perform a complete scan of the remaining parameters $(M_{\chi_1},\delta, M_{A^{\prime}})$, discussing the $\chi_1$ relic abundance, its direct and indirect searches, as well as potential signals from astrophysics and accelerators. Our systematic scan shows that $\alpha_D$ = $\alpha_{EM}$ is not disfavored, as some previous analyses, limited to specific benchmarks, may suggest. We also find that when the $\chi_1$ relic density matches observation direct and indirect searches are not kinematically accessible. On the other hand we find that the projected luminosity of FASER, a detector searching for Long Lived Particles (LLP) decay at the LHC, can probe or rule out the parameters space of the model for $M_{\chi_1}\lesssim$ 7 GeV, 100 MeV $\lesssim \delta\lesssim$ 300 MeV and $M_{A^{\prime}}\lesssim$ 25 GeV. This range of parameter could be significantly extended by the FASER 2 upgrade proposed for the High-Luminosity phase at the LHC. The parameter space probed by LLP seaches partially overlaps with that probed by $\chi_1$ capture in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings via $\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ Vector Boson Scattering at Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, the couplings between gauge bosons are tightly constrained by the principles of gauge symmetry and renormalizability. However, the presence of anomalous couplings suggests the possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this study, we focus on the sensitivities of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs), specially the dimension-8 operators associated with field-strength tensor structures within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, at future Muon Colliders. Our analysis targets the neutral aQGC-sensitive processes $\mu^{+}\mu^{-} \to \mu^+ \gamma \gamma \mu^-$ and $\mu^{+} \mu^{-} \to \mu^+ Z \gamma \mu^-$, simulated at center-of-mass energies of 3 TeV and 10 TeV. Signal and background events are generated using {\sc MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, interfaced with Pythia8 for parton showering and hadronization, and Delphes for fast detector simulation. A multivariate analysis based on Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) is employed to enhance signal-to-background discrimination, utilizing a comprehensive set of kinematic and reconstructed observables from the final-state particles. Unitarity is preserved through the application of an energy-dependent clipping procedure within the EFT validity regime. Our findings indicate that future muon colliders offer significant sensitivity improvements over current experimental constraints on aQGCs. Furthermore, a comparison with other future collider scenarios shows that the 10 TeV Muon Collider, even with a 10\% systematic uncertainty, provides substantially stronger projected limits at 95\% confidence level than those currently reported by the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC as well as projected limits by future hadron colliders. These results underscore the enhanced potential of high-energy muon collider to probe new physics in the electroweak sector through precision measurements of aQGCs.</description>

      <title>First measurement of jet axis decorrelation with photon-tagged jets in pp and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first measurement of the jet axis decorrelation in events with jets recoiling from an isolated photon is presented for lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The jet axis decorrelation is the angular difference ($\Delta{j}$) between two definitions of the jet axis. This quantity is expected to be sensitive to the scattering of jet constituents in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Events which have a leading isolated photon with transverse momentum 60 $\lt$ $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}$ $\lt$ 200 GeV and recoiling jets with 30 $\lt$ $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{jet}}$ $\lt$ 100 GeV are selected for the analysis. The PbPb result is reported as a function of collision centrality and compared to pp reference data. Jets with $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{jet}}$ $\lt$ 60 GeV have consistent $\Delta{j}$ shapes for pp and PbPb collisions. However, a narrowing is observed for jets with $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{jet}}$ $\gt$ 60 GeV in central PbPb collisions. The results are compared to predictions from the JEWEL, PYQUEN, and HYBRID theoretical models, which include different descriptions of parton energy loss in the QGP.</description>

      <title>On the simulated kinematic distributions of semileptonic $B$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern measurements in flavour physics rely on accurate simulations of signal and background processes, provided by a wide range of general-purpose and specialised Monte-Carlo event generators. Due to the inclusion of a larger amount of specialised decays of heavy hadrons, EvtGen is often the tool of choice for many scenarios. We investigate the phase-space sampling algorithm of EvtGen and demonstrate that it generates unphysical features in kinematic distributions of semileptonic $B$ decays involving resonances, originating from neglected phase-space factors. We provide a short-term solution to correct the affected simulated samples through reweighting of the hadronic invariant mass distribution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first observation of top-quark pair production in association with two photons ($t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma$). The measurement is performed in the single-lepton decay channel using proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ recorded during Run 2 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The $t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma$ production cross section, measured in a fiducial phase space based on particle-level kinematic criteria for the lepton, photons, and jets, is found to be $2.42^{+0.58}_{-0.53}\, \text{fb}$, corresponding to an observed significance of 5.2 standard deviations. Additionally, the ratio of the production cross section of $t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma$ to top-quark pair production in association with one photon is determined, yielding $(3.30^{+0.70}_{-0.65})\times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient classification of electromagnetic activity from $\pi^0$ and electrons remains an open problem in the reconstruction of neutrino interactions in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors. We address this problem using the mathematical framework of Optimal Transport (OT), which has been successfully employed for event classification in other HEP contexts and is ideally suited to the high-resolution calorimetry of LArTPCs. Using a publicly available simulated dataset from the MicroBooNE collaboration, we show that OT methods achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in $e/\pi^0$ classification. The success of this first application indicates the broader promise of OT methods for LArTPC-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of the difference in the $CP$ asymmetries between ${\Lambda}^0_b \rightarrow J / \psi p \pi^-$ and ${\Lambda}^0_b \rightarrow J / \psi p K^-$ decays, $\Delta {\cal A}_{CP}$, is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment in the years 2015--2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $6 \,{\rm fb}^{-1}$. This quantity is measured to be $ \Delta {\cal A}_{CP}=(4.03\pm 1.18\pm 0.23)\%$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. When combined with the previous LHCb result, a value of $\Delta {\cal A}_{CP} = (4.31 \pm 1.06 \pm 0.28)\%$ is obtained, corresponding to a significance of $3.9\sigma$ against the $CP$ symmetry hypothesis. Studies of triple-product asymmetries, which provide an additional probe of $CP$ violation, show no significant deviation from $CP$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $+\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

      <title>Studying AC-LGAD strip sensors from laser and testbeam measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the setup assembled to characterize and measure the spatial and timing resolutions of AC-coupled Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (AC-LGADs), using a 1060 nm laser source to deposit initial charges with a defined calibration methodology. The results were compared to those obtained with a 120 GeV proton beam. Despite the differences in the charge deposition mechanism between the laser and proton beam, the spatial and temporal resolutions were found to be compatible between the two sources after calibration. With 4D tracking detectors expected to play a vital role in upcoming collider experiments, we foresee this work as a way to evaluate the performance of semiconductor sensors that can augment testbeam measurements and accelerate R$\&amp;$D efforts. Additionally, simulation studies using Silvaco TCAD and Weightfield2 were carried out to understand the various contributing factors to the total time resolution in AC-LGAD sensors, measured using the laser source.</description>

This approach allows for the efficient inference of theoretical parameters in high-dimensional inverse problems without the need for posterior training samples. We implement the method on multi-modal benchmark tasks in 2D and 3D to check for the efficacy. A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics.</description>
