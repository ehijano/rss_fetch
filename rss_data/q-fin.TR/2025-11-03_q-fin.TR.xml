      <title>When AI Trading Agents Compete: Adverse Selection of Meta-Orders by Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms by which medium-frequency trading agents are adversely selected by opportunistic high-frequency traders. We use reinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in order to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast to the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes model accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the market (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market maker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the high-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement learning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate the adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium frequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with training against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent learns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent empirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly subject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As high-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the slippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over time. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making RL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quoting under Adverse Selection and Price Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, many dealers have implemented algorithmic models to automatically respond to RFQs and manage flows originating from their electronic platforms. In parallel, building on the foundational work of Ho and Stoll, and later Avellaneda and Stoikov, the academic literature on market making has expanded to address trade size distributions, client tiering, complex price dynamics, alpha signals, and the internalization versus externalization dilemma in markets with dealer-to-client and interdealer-broker segments. In this paper, we tackle two critical dimensions: adverse selection, arising from the presence of informed traders, and price reading, whereby the market maker's own quotes inadvertently reveal the direction of their inventory. These risks are well known to practitioners, who routinely face informed flows and algorithms capable of extracting signals from quoting behavior. Yet they have received limited attention in the quantitative finance literature, beyond stylized toy models with limited actionability. Extending the existing literature, we propose a tractable and implementable framework that enables market makers to adjust their quotes with greater awareness of informational risk.</description>

      <title>An Impulse Control Approach to Market Making in a Hawkes LOB Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimal Market Making problem in a Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulated using a high-fidelity, mutually exciting Hawkes process. Departing from traditional Brownian-driven mid-price models, our setup captures key microstructural properties such as queue dynamics, inter-arrival clustering, and endogenous price impact. Recognizing the realistic constraint that market makers cannot update strategies at every LOB event, we formulate the control problem within an impulse control framework, where interventions occur discretely via limit, cancel, or market orders. This leads to a high-dimensional, non-local Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Quasi-Variational Inequality (HJB-QVI), whose solution is analytically intractable and computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approximation inspired by auxiliary control formulations. Using a two-network PPO-based architecture with self-imitation learning, we demonstrate strong empirical performance with limited training, achieving Sharpe ratios above 30 in a realistic simulated LOB. In addition to that, we solve the HJB-QVI using a deep learning method inspired by Sirignano and Spiliopoulos 2018 and compare the performance with the RL agent. Our findings highlight the promise of combining impulse control theory with modern deep RL to tackle optimal execution problems in jump-driven microstructural markets.</description>
