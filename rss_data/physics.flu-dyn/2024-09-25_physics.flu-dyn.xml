      <title>Experimental characterization of shock-separation interaction over wavy-shaped geometries through feature analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A canonical wavy surface exposed to a Mach 2 flow is investigated through high-frequency Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP), Kulite measurements, and shadowgraph imaging. The wavy surface features a compression and expansion region, two shock-boundary layer interactions, and two shock-separation regions. The unsteady characteristics of the wall pressure and shock angles are presented, demonstrating an increase in amplitude of the instabilities when traveling through the shock systems. Three-dimensional flow features, observed in PSP data, reveal a two-dimensional flow pattern. Higher-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition are implemented to dissect the different flow features, revealing several dominant low-frequency and medium-frequency phenomena. The separation region appears at frequencies with Strouhal numbers between 0.01 and 0.2, confirmed by the frequency content in the local pressure measurement using Kulites.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{L}$-moments reveal the scales of momentum transport in dense canopy flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between a dense forest canopy and atmosphere is a complex fluid-dynamical problem with a wide range of practical applications, spanning from the aspects of carbon sequestration to the spread of wildfires through a forest. To delineate the eddy processes specific to canopy flows, we develop an $\mathcal{L}$-moment based event framework and apply it on a suite of observational datasets encompassing both canopy and atmospheric surface layer flows. In this framework, the turbulent fluctuations are considered as a chronicle of positive and negative events having finite lengths or time scales, whose statistical distributions are quantified through the $\mathcal{L}$ moments. $\mathcal{L}$ moments are statistically more robust than the conventional moments and have earlier been used in hydrology applications, but here we show how this concept is useful even for canopy flows. The $\mathcal{L}$-moment framework is complemented with wavelet analysis, leading to a discovery of a mixed time scale controlling the momentum exchanges between the atmosphere and the canopy air space. The origin of this mixed-scale is intimately linked to an interaction between two different eddy processes that transport momentum in the gradient and counter-gradient directions, respectively. This finding gives rise to a conceptual model of canopy turbulence that resolves a long-standing issue in canopy flows: why the integral timescale of vertical velocity increases as the heights approach the forest floor? Moreover, this model explains the intermittent nature of the wind inside a canopy despite its average being nearly zero due to canopy drag.</description>

      <title>The interplay of plasticity and elasticity in elastoviscoplastic flows in wavy channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids, which exhibit both solid-like and liquid-like behavior depending on the applied stress, are critical in industrial processes involving complex geometries such as porous media and wavy channels. In this study, we investigate how flow characteristics and channel design affect EVP fluid flow through a wavy channel, using numerical simulations supported by microfluidic experiments. Our results reveal that elasticity significantly influences flow dynamics, reducing pressure drops and expanding unyielded regions. Notably, we find that even minimal elasticity can shift the flow from steady to time-dependent regimes, a transition less pronounced in viscoelastic fluids. Additionally, we show that the development of stagnation regions can be prevented when using a modified EVP fluid with enhanced elasticity, thus providing a full global yielding of the material. This study elucidates the role of elasticity in modifying flow patterns and stress distribution within EVP fluids, offering insights into the optimization of industrial applications, such as the displacement of yield stress fluids in enhanced oil recovery, gas extraction, cementing, and other processes where flow efficiency is critical.</description>

      <title>Reynolds number effects on turbulent flow in curved channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the flow in curved channels, an archetypal configuration that allows insights into problems featuring turbulence bounded by curved walls. Besides its relevance to many engineering applications, it exhibits a rich physics due to the presence of turbulence superimposed to large-scale structures driven by centrifugal instabilities. The resulting secondary motions, which depend on the channel geometry and Reynolds number, break symmetry between the convex and the concave surface. We investigate the effects of curvature by focusing on two cases of mildly and strongly curved channel, in which shear and inertia are supposed to control the general features of the flow, respectively. For each geometry, we examine systematically the effects of the Reynolds number: we run a campaign of direct numerical simulations covering flow regimes from laminar up to moderately high value of Reynolds number - based on bulk velocity and channel height - of 87000. Our analysis pivots around the friction coefficient, which is the macroscopic observable of the flow, and explores how the large-scale structures change their shape and role on turbulence for increasing Reynolds numbers. Special attention is paid to the longitudinal large-scale structures (resembling Dean vortices), and how their dynamics of splitting and merging is influenced by curvature. In addition, we also observe and characterise transverse large-scale structures populating the convex wall of strongly curved channels, which are originated by streamwise instabilities and contribute to the negative production of turbulence kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Stokes flow around two unequal cylinders: A complex variable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the Stokes equations for the flow around two parallel translating and rotating cylinders using tools from complex analysis. Our results generalise earlier work for cylinders of equal radius, and includes the problem of a cylinder moving near a planar wall as a limiting case. The solution also includes the case of two touching cylinders, however because the required limit is challenging we also resolve the problem. Examining this limit further, we show that it affects the separation points in the flow by causing them to move to the point of contact when the cylinders are brought together.</description>

      <title>Transient bubble rising in the presence of a surfactant at very low concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of the dynamic adsorption layer when a bubble is released in a tank containing water with a tiny amount of surfactant. The influence of the sorption kinetic constants is examined by comparing the experiments with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100. The experiments allowed us to determine the parameter conditions that lead to a stable bubble rising and to validate the simulation. A simple scaling analysis and the simulation show that the formation of the dynamic adsorption layer can be split into three phases characterized by disparate time scales. The mechanisms controlling those phases are surfactant convection, adsorption-desorption, and diffusion. The amount of surfactant adsorbed onto the interface increases monotonously throughout the three phases. The experiments and the simulation show that the rising velocity reaches a maximum at times of the order of $k_d^{-1}$ ($k_d$ is the desorption constant) when the dynamic adsorption layer is practically formed. This occurs even when only traces of surfactant are present in the liquid. The non-monotonous behavior of the maximum surfactant surface concentration is explained in terms of the reverse flow in the rear of the bubble right after the bubble release. This work contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay between hydrodynamics and surfactant transport and kinetics over bubble rising.</description>

      <title>Liquid sloshing behaviours in an elastic tank and suppression effect of baffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is employed to investigate the forces and deformations experienced by LNG tanks during liquid sloshing. As a Lagrangian approach, the SPH method offers the advantage of accurately modelling free-surface flow. The fluid phase consisting of water and air is modelled as a multi-phase system for getting closer to real transport situations. Additionally, the application of FSI within a single framework reduces data transfer discrepancies between fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. To validate the reliability of the numerical methodology, the simulation results about the free surface elevation and wave profiles are compared with experimental data. Subsequently, ring baffles and vertical baffles are introduced separately. While the degree of force acting on the tanks is assessed, the anti-sloshing effectiveness of baffles on sloshing suppression and the variations in stress and strain distributions are evaluated. Further, to compare the influence of the material properties of baffles on sloshing phenomena, the rigid baffle and elastic baffle with different Young's moduli are immersed in the liquid. The results indicate that in this LNG tank configuration, the closer the baffle properties align with rigidity, the more effective the sloshing inhibition.</description>

      <title>Noise Reduction in Wind Turbine Airfoils with Serrated Trailing Edges: An Experimental Study in Low Turbulence Wind Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the noise reduction achieved by airfoils with serrated trailing edges in a low turbulence wind tunnel, focusing on acoustic spectral characteristics and wake flow field measurements. We analyze the effects of various factors, including Reynolds number, angle of attack, serration parameters, and model type, on sound power levels and far-field radiation patterns. Our findings reveal that serrated trailing edges significantly reduce noise across a broader frequency range than previously documented, particularly in the mid-to-high frequency range, with reductions bounded by Strouhal numbers $St_u = 1$ and $St_l = 0.48$. Interestingly, the serration geometry exhibits minimal impact on noise reduction, which varies with the angle of attack and airfoil profile across all tested conditions. Additionally, while serrations effectively lower noise levels, especially at higher frequencies, they do not significantly alter the airfoil's acoustic directivity patterns. Measurements of wake flow velocity spectra demonstrate a clear correlation between reduced wake turbulence and noise reduction, as serrated edges decrease the power spectral density of turbulent velocity fluctuations, effectively disrupting larger vortex structures responsible for noise generation. These valuable insights contribute to understanding the aerodynamic and acoustic benefits of serrated trailing edges, warranting further experimental validation in future studies.</description>

      <title>Modeling inertial flows with meshless Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the limitations of the Lattice Boltzmann Method in simulating inertial flows is the coupling of the discretization of space to the velocity discretization. It requires an increase of the size of computational lattices in order to increase the Reynolds number at a fixed velocity and viscosity. In this work, we adopt the recently proposed meshless formulation of Lattice Boltzmann Method to the problem of inertial flows. In contrast to the standard algorithm, it allows to decouple space and velocity discretizations. Thus, one can change the conversion factors from lattice to physical units for length, velocity, and body force by scaling the streaming distance. In turn, one increases the Reynolds number without increasing the size of the discretization. We measure the accuracy and efficiency of this approach in the K\'{a}rm\'{a}n vortex street behind a circular obstacle and the flow through a porous sample in Darcy and inertial regime. Additionally, we apply the meshless streaming step to the recently proposed fixed relaxation time $\tau=1$ LBM to extend its applicability to model inertial flows.</description>

      <title>Spreading of Low-viscosity Ink Filaments Driven by Bath Viscoelasticity in Embedded Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inks deposited in conventional direct ink writing need to be able to support their own weight and that of the upper layers with minimal deformation to preserve the structural integrity of the three-dimensional (3D) printed parts. This constraint limits the range of usable inks to high-viscosity materials. Embedded printing enables the use of much softer inks by depositing the materials in a bath of another fluid that provides external support, thus diversifying the types of 3D printable structures. The interactions between the ink and bath fluids, however, give rise to a unique type of defect: spreading of the dispensed ink behind the moving nozzle. By printing horizontal threads made of dyed water in baths of Carbopol suspensions, we demonstrate that the spreading can be attributed to the pressure field generated in the viscous bath by the relative motion of the nozzle. As the pressure gradient increases with the viscosity of the bath fluid while the viscosity of the ink resists the flow, a larger bath-to-ink viscosity ratio results in more spreading for low-concentration Carbopol baths. For high-concentration, yield-stress-fluid baths, we find that the steady-state viscosity alone cannot account for the spreading, as the elastic stress becomes comparable to the viscous stress and the bath fluid around the dispensed ink undergoes fluidization and resolidification. By parameterizing the transient rheology of the high-concentration Carbopol suspensions using a simple viscoelastic model, we suggest that the ink spreading is exacerbated by the elasticity but is mitigated by the yield stress as long as the yield stress is low enough to allow steady injection of the ink. These results help illuminate the link between the bath rheology and the printing quality in embedded 3D printing.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Accelerating Combusting Flows with a Methane-Vitiated Air Flamelet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a numerical study of a diffusion flame in a reacting, two-dimensional, turbulent, viscous, multi-component, compressible mixing layer subject to a large favorable streamwise pressure gradient. The boundary-layer equations are solved coupled with both the $k$-$\omega$ and SST turbulence models. A compressible extension of the flamelet progress variable method has been proposed and tested for use with large eddy simulations or Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes analyses of the burning of methane in pure air and vitiated air; the latter being particularly relevant in turbine burner scenarios. Effects of the level of detail of the reaction mechanism on the sub-grid and resolved-scale computations are studied. A comparison is made with results obtained using a simplified one-step reaction. The numerical results employing the flamelet model with the more detailed reaction mechanism show faster chemistry, significantly reduced peak temperatures and stronger sensitivity to pressure. Vitiated air flames are found to be dominated by unstable solutions, resulting in a weak flame with substantially lower peak temperature and impeded development, struggling to persist without quenching.</description>

      <title>Inertia onset in disordered porous media flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the very onset of the inertial regime in the fluid flow at the pore level in a three-dimensional, disordered, highly porous media. We analyze the flow structure in a wide range of Reynolds numbers starting from 0.01 up to 100. We focus on qualitative and quantitative changes that appear with increasing Reynolds number. To do that, we investigate the weakening of the channeling effect, defined as the existence of preferred flow paths in a system. We compute tortuosity, spatial kinetic energy localization, and the pore-space volume fraction containing negative streamwise velocity to assess accompanying changes quantitatively. Our results of tortuosity and participation number derivatives show that the very onset of inertia is apparent for Reynolds number Re $\sim 0.1$, an order of magnitude lower than indicated by analyzing relations of friction factor with the Reynolds number. Moreover, we show that the vortex structures appear at Reynolds number two orders of magnitude higher than the onset of inertia.</description>

      <title>Fourier neural operators for spatiotemporal dynamics in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows for most real-world applications remains an outstanding computational challenge. Several machine learning approaches have recently been proposed to alleviate the computational cost even though they become unstable or unphysical for long time predictions. We identify that the Fourier neural operator (FNO) based models combined with a partial differential equation (PDE) solver can accelerate fluid dynamic simulations and thus address computational expense of large-scale turbulence simulations. We treat the FNO model on the same footing as a PDE solver and answer important questions about the volume and temporal resolution of data required to build pre-trained models for turbulence. We also discuss the pitfalls of purely data-driven approaches that need to be avoided by the machine learning models to become viable and competitive tools for long time simulations of turbulence.</description>
