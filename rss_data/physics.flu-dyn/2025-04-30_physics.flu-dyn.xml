      <title>Perfectly Matched Layers and Characteristic Boundaries in Lattice Boltzmann: Accuracy vs Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial boundary conditions (BCs) play a ubiquitous role in numerical simulations of transport phenomena in several diverse fields, such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, acoustics, geophysics, and many more. They are essential for accurately capturing the behavior of physical systems whenever the simulation domain is truncated for computational efficiency purposes. Ideally, an artificial BC would allow relevant information to enter or leave the computational domain without introducing artifacts or unphysical effects. Boundary conditions designed to control spurious wave reflections are referred to as nonreflective boundary conditions (NRBCs). Another approach is given by the perfectly matched layers (PMLs), in which the computational domain is extended with multiple dampening layers, where outgoing waves are absorbed exponentially in time. In this work, the definition of PML is revised in the context of the lattice Boltzmann method. The impact of adopting different types of BCs at the edge of the dampening zone is evaluated and compared, in terms of both accuracy and computational costs. It is shown that for sufficiently large buffer zones, PMLs allow stable and accurate simulations even when using a simple zeroth-order extrapolation BC. Moreover, employing PMLs in combination with NRBCs potentially offers significant gains in accuracy at a modest computational overhead, provided the parameters of the BC are properly tuned to match the properties of the underlying fluid flow.</description>

      <title>PQG-DL-Ekman: a triple-deck boundary layer theory for large-scale atmospheric flow with moist process closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced mathematical models for atmospheric dynamics at various scales have a long and rich history. However, versions of such models that explicitly incorporate moisture and phase changes have been developed only fairly recently. This work merges one of said modeling innovations, namely Smith and Stechmann's \emph{precipitating quasigeostrophic} (PQG) model family, with a triple-deck boundary layer theory due to Klein et al.~that extends the classical QG-Ekman theory by an intermediate \emph{diabatic layer} (DL). A detailed analysis of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation and Kessler-type bulk microphysics closures is included in the systematic derivation of the resulting PQG-DL-Ekman theory. Furthermore, to illustrate some of the model's properties, explicit axisymmetric solutions of the precipitating diabatic layer equations are derived and combined with numerical sample solutions for the bulk flow.</description>

      <title>Brain pulsations enhance cerebrospinal fluid flow in perivascular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach to modelling cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in arterial perivascular spaces (PVS) is adopted by proposing that the outer PVS boundary oscillates due to brain pulsations in addition to arterial wall motion driven by a blood pressure wave. Lubrication theory is employed to derive a mathematical model for the CSF flow, which is then solved numerically. A parametric analysis is undertaken to investigate the effect of the brain pulsations, which shows that pulsations magnify the net axial CSF flows created by the arterial wall motion. The findings suggest that net axial CSF flows are almost entirely positive (deeper into the brain), with arterial wall motion highly dependent on PVS-perforating artery configurations. Given the glymphatic hypothesis, the findings support the clinical practice of treating dilated PVS as indicators of an increased likelihood of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement-learning-assisted control of four-roll mills: geometric symmetry and inertial effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding the intrinsic symmetry of a flow system in training its machine learning algorithms has become a significant trend in the recent surge of their application in fluid mechanics. This paper leverages the geometric symmetry of a four-roll mill (FRM) to enhance its training efficiency. Stabilizing and precisely controlling droplet trajectories in a FRM is challenging due to the unstable nature of the extensional flow with a saddle point. Extending the work of Vona &amp; Lauga, this study applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to effectively guide a displaced droplet to the center of the FRM. Through direct numerical simulations, we explore the applicability of DRL in controlling FRM flow with moderate inertial effects, i.e., Reynolds number $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, a nonlinear regime previously unexplored. The FRM's geometric symmetry allows control policies trained in one of the eight sub-quadrants to be extended to the entire domain, reducing training costs. Our results indicate that the DRL-based control method can successfully guide a displaced droplet to the target center with robust performance across various starting positions, even from substantially far distances. The work also highlights potential directions for future research, particularly focusing on efficiently addressing the delay effects in flow response caused by inertia. This study presents new advances in controlling droplet trajectories in more nonlinear and complex situations, with potential applications to other nonlinear flows. The geometric symmetry used in this cutting-edge reinforcement learning approach can also be applied to other control methods.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Phase Changes in Aircraft Exhaust: A Computational Study on Early Contrail Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical framework is developed to model contrail formation in the near-field exhaust of aircraft engines, resolving non-equilibrium phase transitions in compressible, multi-component, non-ideal fluid flows. The approach combines well-established methods from steam turbine modeling for liquid-phase transitions with cloud microphysics models for ice formation. It resolves homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, interphase momentum exchange, and polydispersed size distributions of droplets, ice crystals, and soot particles. These models are implemented in a parallelized finite-volume solver and applied to a high-bypass turbofan exhaust configuration with simplified geometry. Results indicate that non-equilibrium effects strongly influence condensation and freezing dynamics, while nozzle geometry and water vapor content modulate local supersaturation and phase transition pathways. The findings underscore the limitations of equilibrium-based models and highlight the value of physics-based, scalable tools for analyzing contrail formation across fuels and propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>A novel real-time aeroelastic hybrid simulation system of section model wind tunnel testing based on adaptive extended Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastically-supported section model tests are the most basic experimental technique in wind engineering, where helical springs are commonly employed to simulate the two-degree-of-freedom low-order modal motions of flexible structures. However, the traditional technique has intrinsic limitations in accurately modeling nonlinear structural behaviors and accurate adjustments of nonlinear structural damping. This study proposes a novel Real-Time Aeroelastic Hybrid Simulation system for section model wind tunnel tests by integrating an active control algorithm of adaptive Kalman filter. The proposed system enables the simulation of nonlinear heave-transverse-torsion coupled vibrations of a section model under the action of the oncoming wind. The structural properties, i.g. mass, damping and stiffness, are numerically simulated via an active control system, and the aerodynamic forces are physically modelled via the model-wind interaction in the wind tunnel. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed RTAHS system, a MATLAB/Simulink-FLUENT/UDF co-simulation framework is developed. Numerical verification results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively estimates the motion responses in both linear and nonlinear scenarios.</description>

      <title>Implications of shallow-shell models for topographic relaxation on icy satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Icy satellites host topography at many length scales, from rifts and craters on the small end to equatorial-pole shell thickness differences that are comparable to these bodies' circumference. The rate of topographic evolution depends on the rheology of the ice shell, the difference in density between the shell and potential global subsurface oceans, the ice shell thickness distribution, as well as the rate of tidal heat dissipation in the shell. Here we analyze relaxation of topography starting from the Stokes equations for viscous fluid flow. We write out the shallow-shell models (with and without a rigid crust) and compare the resulting time scales to previous work. Using three-dimensional linearized flow for small-amplitude topographic perturbations, we recover the time scales of relaxation from the shallow models as well as shells that are not shallow. For a shell of constant viscosity, we find that the topographic relaxation time scale is constant for wavelengths larger than the ice thickness, an idea that runs contrary to the existing paradigm. For a shell with a viscosity that decreases exponentially with depth, we show numerically that there is a regime where the larger viscosity outer crust acts as a nearly rigid boundary. In this case, the relaxation time scale depends on the wavelength. For the largest spatial scales, the time scale becomes independent of wavelength again and the value is set by the average shell viscosity. However, the spatial scale that this transition occurs at becomes larger as the viscosity contrast increases, limiting the applicability of the scale-independent relaxation rate. These results for the relaxation of topography have implications for interpreting relaxed crater profiles, inferences of ice shell thickness from topography, and upcoming observations from missions to the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics converts chiral flagellar rotation into contactless actuation of microdiscs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile bacteria are a wonder of nature's engineering: microscopic engines that transduce biochemical energy into the work they require to explore their environment. This added energy turns the surrounding fluid into a bath that departs from an equilibrium one. Bacterial baths agitate suspended spheres more vividly than thermal fluctuations and can power microscopic ratchets. A salient requirement to extract work from bacterial baths was the asymmetric shape of the ratchets, designed to rectify the interactions with bacteria. In contrast with past results, here we show that swimming E. coli power the persistent rotation of discs, in absence of asymmetry. Combining state-of-the art nanoprinting, quantitative measurements of the dynamics of individual bacteria, and hydrodynamic modeling, we elucidate the mechanism and show that the counter-rotation of the flagella and the bacterium body lead to a torque dipole and traction onto the disc, and subsequent rotation. Remarkably, the mechanism is independent of the direction or orientation of navigation of bacteria under the disc, hence additive and contactless. Resulting from the interplay of the torque dipole of flagellated bacteria with simple geometric confinement, this hydrodynamic mechanism bridges scales, leveraging the chirality of bacteria nanomotors towards the manipulation of objects at least ten thousand times larger. The study lays the groundwork for novel bio-hybrid micromachines that harness living microorganisms for controlled motion at the microscale. Our findings provide further fundamental insights into bacterial hydrodynamics and open avenues for the development of autonomous, self-powered microdiscs for the study of chiral fluids.</description>

      <title>Chemotactic aggregation dynamics of micro-swimmers in Brinkman flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study through analysis and simulations of a continuum model the collective chemotactic dynamics of micro-swimmers immersed in viscous Brinkman flows. The Brinkman viscous flow approximates with a resistance or friction term the presence of inert impurities or stationary obstacles immersed in the fluid, an environment that can be regarded as a wet porous medium. Analysis of the linearized system reveals that resistance primarily affects the development of collective swimming instabilities and barely affects chemotactic instabilities. We present a parameter phase space for the distinct types of dynamics we can expect in the case of auto-chemotactic bacteria-like pusher swimmers for varying medium resistance, chemotactic response strength, and hydrodynamic coupling strength values. Simulations of the full nonlinear system show that resistance impacts the collective dynamics for each of these states because it inhibits the hydrodynamic interactions and the emergence of the collective swimmer. Surprisingly, and not expected from the linear analysis predictions, we find that resistance also hampers the chemotactic aggregation of the swimmers because it impedes their ability to navigate efficiently and collectively towards chemical cues and assemble into clusters. We show simulations of the complex system for parameters sets from each of the phase-space regions and quantify the observed behavior. Lastly, we discuss the experimental values of the parameters and discuss possible future experimental realizations of this system.</description>

      <title>A molecular-kinetic hypothesis on pressure behavior in gas flows at low Mach numbers and its relation to the second viscosity and turbulent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18914v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent works, we proposed a theory of turbulence creation via the second coefficient of the virial expansion (i.e. the van der Waals effect). This theory relies, in part, on the empirically observed "equilibrated" behavior of pressure in compressible flows at low Mach numbers. However, a fundamental explanation for such a behavior of pressure does not currently exist, because the conventional kinetic theory leads instead to the adiabatic flow in the form of the usual compressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations.
  To explain this behavior of pressure from the molecular-kinetic perspective, in the current work we introduce a novel correction into the pair correlation function in the closure of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. This correction matches the rate of change of the average distance between particles to the macroscopic compression or expansion rate of the gas. Remarkably, the novel correction introduces a linear damping into the pressure equation, which equilibrates the pressure solution. At low Mach numbers, this linear pressure damping becomes strong, and manifests as the second viscosity in the momentum equation, which selectively suppresses the velocity divergence. As a result, the second viscosity governs the linear instability which creates turbulent dynamics, thereby defining the critical value of the Reynolds number. The ratio of the second and shear viscosities, together with the critical value of the Reynolds number, are proportional to the reciprocal of the packing fraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework to study homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in a viscoelastic fluid, regarded as a perturbation of a Newtonian incompressible fluid, where the fluid relaxation time, or else the Weissenberg number, plays the role of small parameter. We use a Martin-Siggia-Rose framework to obtain a formal expression for the velocity correlation function of the non-Newtonian flow, and we expand this formal expression to linear order in the relaxation time. The coefficients in this expansion are correlation functions of the base Newtonian flow. We do not derive these correlations, instead we replace them by their values according to K41 theory, which could be regarded as an extreme form of renormalization. While substantial work will be necessary to validate the model against numerical and experimental data, preliminary results are encouraging.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations and identifying governing equations from observational data. In this study, we apply PINNs to investigate vortex-type solutions of quasi-integrable equations in two spatial dimensions, specifically the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equations. These equations are toy models for geostrophic shallow water dynamics in planetary atmospheres. We first demonstrate that PINNs can successfully solve these equations in the forward process using a mesh-free approach with automatic differentiation. However, in the inverse process, substantial misidentification occurs due to the structural similarities between the ZK and the RLW equations. To address this issue, we then introduce conservation law-enhanced PINNs, initial condition variations, and a friction-based perturbation approach to improve identification accuracy. Our results show that incorporating small perturbations while preserving conservation laws significantly enhances the resolution of equation identification. These findings may contribute to the broader goal of using deep learning techniques for discovering governing equations in complex fluid dynamical systems, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</description>

Abstract: Hypersonic flow conditions pose exceptional challenges for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. Critical phenomena include compressibility effects, shock/turbulent boundary layer interactions, turbulence-chemistry interaction in thermo-chemical non-equilibrium, and ablation-induced surface roughness and blowing effects. This comprehensive review synthesizes recent developments in adapting turbulence models to hypersonic applications, examining approaches ranging from empirical modifications to physics-based reformulations and novel data-driven methodologies. We provide a systematic evaluation of current RANS-based turbulence modeling capabilities, comparing eddy viscosity and Reynolds stress transport formulations in their ability to predict engineering quantities of interest such as separation characteristics and wall heat transfer. Our analysis encompasses the latest experimental and direct numerical simulation datasets for validation, specifically addressing two- and three-dimensional equilibrium turbulent boundary layers and shock/turbulent boundary layer interactions across both smooth and rough surfaces. Key multi-physics considerations including catalysis and ablation phenomena along with the integration of conjugate heat transfer into a RANS solver for efficient design of a thermal protection system are also discussed. We conclude by identifying the critical gaps in the available validation databases and limitations of the existing turbulence models and suggest potential areas for future research to improve the fidelity of turbulence modeling in the hypersonic regime.</description>

Abstract: Multiphase fluid dynamics, such as falling droplets and rising bubbles, are critical to many industrial applications. However, simulating these phenomena efficiently is challenging due to the complexity of instabilities, wave patterns, and bubble breakup. This paper investigates the potential of scientific machine learning (SciML) to model these dynamics using neural operators and foundation models. We apply sequence-to-sequence techniques on a comprehensive dataset generated from 11,000 simulations, comprising 1 million time snapshots, produced with a well-validated Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) framework. The results demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to capture transient dynamics and intricate fluid interactions, paving the way for more accurate and computationally efficient SciML-based solvers for multiphase applications.</description>

Abstract: Canonical jet in supersonic crossflow studies have been widely used to study fundamental physics relevant to a variety of applications. While most JISC works have considered gaseous injection, liquid injection is also of practical interest and introduces additional multiscale physics, such as atomization and evaporation, that complicate the flow dynamics. To facilitate further understanding of these complex phenomena, this work presents multiphase simulations of reacting and non-reacting JISC configurations with freestream Mach numbers of roughly 4.5. Adaptive mesh refinement is used with a volume of fluid scheme to capture liquid breakup and turbulent mixing at high resolution. The results compare the effects of the jet momentum ratio and freestream temperature on jet penetration, mixing, and combustion dynamics. For similar jet momentum ratios, the jet penetration and mixing characteristics are similar for the reacting and non-reacting cases. Mixing analyses reveal that vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy intensities peak in the jet shear layers, where vortex stretching is the dominant turbulence generation mechanism for all cases. Cases with lower freestream temperatures yield negligible heat release, while cases with elevated freestream temperatures exhibit chemical reactions primarily along the leading bow shock and within the boundary layer in the jet wake. The evaporative cooling quenches the chemical reactions in the primary atomization zone at the injection height, such that the flow rates of several product species plateau after x/d=20. Substantial concentrations of final product species are only observed along the bow shock-due to locally elevated temperature and pressure-and in the boundary layer far downstream-where lower flow velocities counteract the effects of prolonged ignition delays. This combination of factors leads to low combustion efficiency at the domain exit.</description>

      <title>UP-dROM : Uncertainty-Aware and Parametrised dynamic Reduced-Order Model, application to unsteady flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23236</link>

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.</description>
