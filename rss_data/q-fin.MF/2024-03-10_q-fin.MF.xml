      <title>A mean field game approach to equilibrium consumption under external habit formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the equilibrium consumption under external habit formation in a large population of agents. We first formulate problems under two types of conventional habit formation preferences, namely linear and multiplicative external habit formation, in a mean field game framework. In a log-normal market model with the asset specialization, we characterize one mean field equilibrium in analytical form in each problem, allowing us to understand some quantitative properties of the equilibrium strategy and conclude some financial implications caused by consumption habits from a mean-field perspective. In each problem with n agents, we construct an approximate Nash equilibrium for the n-player game using the obtained mean field equilibrium when n is sufficiently large. The explicit convergence order in each problem can also be obtained.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption with loss aversion and reference to past spending maximum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02648v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal consumption problem for a loss-averse agent with reference to past consumption maximum. To account for loss aversion on relative consumption, an S-shaped utility is adopted that measures the difference between the non-negative consumption rate and a fraction of the historical spending peak. We consider the concave envelope of the utility with respect to consumption, allowing us to focus on an auxiliary HJB variational inequality on the strength of concavification principle and dynamic programming arguments. By applying the dual transform and smooth-fit conditions, the auxiliary HJB variational inequality is solved in piecewise closed-form and some thresholds of the wealth variable are obtained. The optimal consumption and investment control can be derived in the piecewise feedback form. The rigorous verification proofs on optimality and concavification principle are provided. Some numerical sensitivity analysis and financial implications are also presented.</description>
