      <title>ZETA: a library for Zonotope-based EsTimation and fAult diagnosis of discrete-time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ZETA, a new MATLAB library for Zonotope-based EsTimation and fAult diagnosis of discrete-time systems. It features user-friendly implementations of set representations based on zonotopes, namely zonotopes, constrained zonotopes, and line zonotopes, in addition to a basic implementation of interval arithmetic. This library has capabilities starting from the basic set operations with these sets, including propagations through nonlinear functions using various approximation methods. The features of ZETA allow for reachability analysis and state estimation of discrete-time linear, nonlinear, and descriptor systems, in addition to active fault diagnosis of linear systems. Efficient order reduction methods are also implemented for the respective set representations. Some examples are presented in order to illustrate the functionalities of the new library.</description>

      <title>Towards a Higher Roofline for Matrix-Vector Multiplication in Matrix-Free HOSFEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-order/spectral finite element method (HOSFEM) is a widely used numerical method for solving PDEs, with its performance primarily relying on axhelm, a matrix-free kernel for element-local matrix-vector multiplications. In axhelm, geometric factors account for over half of memory access but minimally contribute to computational workload. This imbalance significantly constrains the performance roofline, indicating that further optimization of tensor contraction, the core computation in axhelm, yields only minimal improvements. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a low-cost on-the-fly recalculation of geometric factors for trilinear elements, thereby unlocking substantial potential for optimizing tensor contraction. The proposed approach is implemented in Nekbone, a standard HOSFEM benchmark. With optimizations such as merging scalar factors, partial recalculation, Tensor Core acceleration, and constant memory utilization, performance reaches 85%-100% of the higher roofline. The optimized kernels achieve speedups of 1.74x-4.10x on NVIDIA A100 and 1.99x-3.77x on DCU K100. This leads to a 1.12x-1.40x speedup for Nekbone.</description>

      <title>PyIT2FLS: A New Python Toolkit for Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.10051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy logic is an accepted and well-developed approach for constructing verbal models. Fuzzy based methods are getting more popular, while the engineers deal with more daily life tasks. This paper presents a new Python toolkit for Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (IT2FLS). Developing software tools is an important issue for facilitating the practical use of theoretical results. There are limited tools for implementing IT2FLSs in Python. The developed PyIT2FLS is providing a set of tools for fast and easy modeling of fuzzy systems. This paper includes a brief description of how developed toolkit can be used. Also, three examples are given showing the usage of the developed toolkit for simulating IT2FLSs. First, a simple rule-based system is developed and it's codes are presented in the paper. The second example is the prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series using IT2FLS. In this example, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for determining system parameters while minimizing the mean square error. In the last example, an IT2FPID is designed and used for controlling a linear time-delay system. The code for the examples are available on toolkit's GitHub page: https://github.com/Haghrah/PyIT2FLS. The simulations and their results confirm the ability of the developed toolkit to be used in a wide range of the applications.</description>
