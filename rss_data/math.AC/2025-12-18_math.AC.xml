      <title>On S-J-Noetherian Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity, $S\subseteq R$ be a multiplicative set and $J$ be an ideal of $R$. In this paper, we introduce the concept of $S$-$J$-Noetherian rings, which generalizes both $J$-Noetherian rings and $S$-Noetherian rings. We study several properties and charaterizations of this new class of rings. For instance, we prove Cohen's-type theorem for $S$-$J$-Noetherian rings. Among other results, we establish the existence of $S$-primary decomposition in $S$-$J$-Noetherian rings as a generalization of classical Lasker-Noether theorem.</description>

      <title>Structural Analysis of Commutative S-Reduced Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity, $S \subseteq R$ be a multiplicative set. In this paper, we establish that the intersection of all $S$-prime ideals in an $S$-reduced ring is $S$-zero. Also, we show that an $S$-Artinian reduced ring is isomorphic to the finite direct product of fields. Furthermore, we provide an example of an $S$-reduced ring which is a uniformly-$S$-Armendariz ring (in short, $u$-$S$-Armendariz$)$ ring. Additionally, we prove that the class of uniformly-$S$-reduced rings (in short, $u$-$S$-reduced rings) belongs to the class of $u$-$S$-Armendariz rings. Among other results, we establish the relationship between $S$-reduced rings and $S$-strongly Hopfian rings. Finally, we prove the structure theorem for $S$-reduced rings.</description>

      <title>Equidimensional morphisms onto splinters are pure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a Noetherian ring $R$ is a splinter if and only if for every equidimensional surjective morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(S) \to \operatorname{Spec}(R)$, the map $R \to S$ is pure. This yields a large, nontrivial class of ring maps that are automatically pure. More generally, we prove that a locally Noetherian scheme $Y$ is locally a splinter if and only if every locally equidimensional morphism $X \to Y$ is strongly pure. Special cases of our results show that equidimensional fibrations over normal $\mathbf{Q}$-schemes or regular schemes of arbitrary characteristic are strongly pure. The main ingredient is a new factorization result for locally equidimensional morphisms of schemes, which is of independent interest. Additionally, we prove a weak Boutot-type theorem for $F$-rationality, which says that $F$-rationality descends under pure ring maps that are locally equidimensional under universally catenary assumptions. This statement is false without the locally equidimensional hypothesis.</description>

      <title>GL-algebras in positive characteristic II: the polynomial ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study GL-equivariant modules over the infinite variable polynomial ring $S = k[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, ...]$ with $k$ an infinite field of characteristic $p &gt; 0$. We extend many of Sam--Snowden's far-reaching results from characteristic zero to this setting. For example, while the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of a finitely generated GL-equivariant $S$-module need not be finite in positive characteristic, we show that the resolution still has finitely many "linear strands of higher slope".
  The crux of this paper is two technical results. The first is an extension to positive characteristic of Snowden's recent linearization of Draisma's embedding theorem which we use to study the generic category of $S$-modules. The second is a Nagpal-type "shift theorem" about torsion $S$-modules for which we introduce certain categorifications of the Hasse derivative. These two results together allow us to obtain explicit generators for the derived category. In a follow-up paper, we also use these results to prove finiteness results for local cohomology modules.</description>

      <title>The local homological structure of generalized splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized splines are a simultaneous generalization of GKM theory -- which studies equivariant cohomology -- and classical splines, which provide piecewise approximations of functions. Generalized splines can also be understood via schemes, with the interpolation constraints -- or so-called GKM-condition -- encoded by gluing along certain closed subschemes. This view provides a local-global principle, with the local pictures retaining the generalized spline structure. Consequently, the behavior of generalized splines over local rings controls certain global phenomena, such as projectivity and often freeness.
  We introduce an interface between the homological study of local rings and the combinatorial study of generalized splines. We identify precisely how the generalized spline structure coordinates with the existing homological local ring machinery. This is accomplished by two exact sequences that provide a regulatory structure on the local cohomology of a generalized spline module. As an application, we use this to prove that for any edge-labeled graph $G$ with principal ideal labels, and any Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$ of Krull dimension 2 at each maximal ideal, the module of splines $R_G$ is free, provided it has finite projective dimension. As a special case, this implies every generalized spline module over $k[x,y]$ with principal edge labels is free.</description>
