      <title>Quantum Hall Effect without Chern Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field, and has later been generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this remarkable phenomenon to the energetic separation of substantial but non-quantized Berry fluxes within the topologically trivial bands. Adding a random disorder potential then nudges the system into a stable quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime of the clean system obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window in either of the trivial bands. Our results are corroborated by extensive numerical transport simulations as well as the analysis of several complementary topological markers.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</description>

      <title>Lean CNNs for mapping electron charge density fields to material properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a lean CNN (convolutional neural network) framework, with a drastically reduced number of fittable parameters (&lt;81K) compared to the benchmarks in current literature, to capture the underlying low-computational cost (i.e., surrogate) relationships between the electron charge density (ECD) fields and their associated effective properties. These lean CNNs are made possible by adding a pre-processing step (i.e., a feature engineering step) that involves the computation of the ECD fields' spatial correlations (specifically, 2-point spatial correlations). The viability and benefits of the proposed lean CNN framework are demonstrated by establishing robust structure-property relationships involving the prediction of effective material properties using the feature-engineered ECD fields as the only input. The framework is evaluated on a dataset of crystalline cubic systems consisting of 1410 molecular structures spanning 62 different elemental species and 3 space groups.</description>

      <title>Two-local modifications of SYK model with quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model may provide us with a good starting point for the experimental study of quantum chaos and holography in the laboratory. Still, the four-local interaction of fermions makes quantum simulation challenging, and it would be good to search for simpler models that keep the essence. In this paper, we argue that the four-local interaction may not be important by introducing a few models that have two-local interactions. The first model is a generalization of the spin-SYK model, which is obtained by replacing the spin variables with SU($d$) generators. Simulations of this class of models might be straightforward on qudit-based quantum devices. We study the case of $d=3, 4, 5, 6$ numerically and observe quantum chaos already for two-local interactions in a wide energy range. We also introduce modifications of spin-SYK and SYK models that have similar structures to the SU($d$) model (e.g., $H=\sum_{p,q}J_{pq}\chi_p\chi_{p+1}\chi_q\chi_{q+1}$ instead of the original SYK Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{p,q,r,s}J_{pqrs}\chi_p\chi_q\chi_r\chi_{s}$), which shows strongly chaotic features although the interaction is essentially two-local. These models may be a good starting point for the quantum simulation of the original SYK model.</description>

      <title>Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum learning models.</description>

      <title>Localization transitions in quadratic systems without quantum chaos</title>

Abstract: Transitions from delocalized to localized eigenstates have been extensively studied in both quadratic and interacting models. The delocalized regime typically exhibits diffusion and quantum chaos, and its properties comply with the random matrix theory (RMT) predictions. However, it is also known that in certain quadratic models, the delocalization in position space is not accompanied by the single-particle quantum chaos. Here, we study the one-dimensional Anderson and Wannier-Stark models that exhibit eigenstate transitions from localization in quasimomentum space (supporting ballistic transport) to localization in position space (with no transport) in a nonstandard thermodynamic limit, which assumes rescaling the model parameters with the system size. We show that the transition point may exhibit an unconventional character of Janus type, i.e., some measures hint at the RMT-like universality emerging at the transition point, while others depart from it. For example, the eigenstate entanglement entropies may exhibit, depending on the bipartition, a volume-law behavior that either approaches the value of Haar-random Gaussian states, or converges to a lower, non-universal value. Our results hint at rich diversity of volume-law eigenstate entanglement entropies in quadratic systems that are not maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough $p$ such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of $1$. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of $0$ with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of $1$ while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any $p$ step.</description>

      <title>Impurity effects in twisted carbon nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>
