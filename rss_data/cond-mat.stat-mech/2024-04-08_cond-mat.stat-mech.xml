      <title>Critical behavior of dirty parafermionic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of $\mathbb Z_n$-symmetric non-Hermitian models of Baxter was shown by Fendley to be exactly solvable via a parafermionic generalization of the Clifford algebra. We study these models with spatially random couplings, and obtain several exact results on thermodynamic singularities as the distributions of couplings are varied. We find that these singularities, independent of $n$, are identical to those in the random transverse-field Ising chain; correspondingly the models host infinite-randomness critical points. Similarities in structure to exact methods for random Ising models, a strong-disorder renormalization group, and generalizations to other models with free spectra, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Heat flows from hot to cold: A simple rigorous example of thermalization in an isolated macroscopic quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present note, we discuss a simple example of a macroscopic quantum many-body system in which the approach to thermal equilibrium from an arbitrary initial state in the microcanonical energy shell is proved without relying on any unproven assumptions. The model, which is equivalent to a free fermion chain, is designed to be a toy model for a weakly heat-conducting one-dimensional solid. We take a phenomenological point of view and perceive that the system is in thermal equilibrium when the measured coarse-grained energy distribution is uniform.
  The result on thermalization reported here is a variation (and an improvement) of our previous result on the irreversible expansion in a free fermion chain. As far as we know, this is the first concrete and rigorous realization of the philosophy on the foundation of equilibrium statistical mechanics proposed by von Neumann in 1929, and further developed recently by Goldstein, Lebowitz, Mastrodonato, Tumulka, and Zangh\`\i and the present author, namely, to characterize thermal equilibrium from a macroscopic viewpoint and to make use of the strong ETH to control the long-time dynamics.
  This note will be the most technical part of my longer article on thermalization, "What is thermal equilibrium and how do we get there?". I am making this document public at this stage since I have already announced (and will announce) the results at some of my talks.</description>

      <title>Effect of active loop extrusion on the two-contact correlations in the interphase chromosome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population-averaged contact maps generated by the chromosome conformation capture technique provide important information about the average frequency of contact between pairs of chromatin loci as a function of the genetic distance between them. However, these datasets do not tell us anything about the joint statistics of simultaneous contacts between genomic loci in individual cells. This kind of statistical information can be extracted using the single-cell Hi-C method, which is capable of detecting a large fraction of simultaneous contacts within a single cell, as well as through modern methods of fluorescent labeling and super-resolution imaging. Motivated by the prospect of the imminent availability of relevant experimental data, in this work we theoretically model the joint statistics of pairs of contacts located along a line perpendicular to the main diagonal of the single-cell contact map. The analysis is performed within the framework of an ideal polymer model with quenched disorder of random loops, which, as previous studies have shown, allows to take into account the influence of the loop extrusion process on the conformational properties of interphase chromatin.</description>

      <title>Linear differential equation approach to the Loschmidt amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo is a popular quantity that allows making predictions about the stability of quantum states under time evolution. In our work, we present an approach that allows us to find a differential equation that can be used to compute the Loschmidt echo. This approach, while in essence perturbative, has the advantage that it converges at finite order. We demonstrate that the approach for generically chosen matrix Hamiltonians often offers advantages over Taylor and cumulant expansions even when we truncate at finite order. We then apply the approach to two ordinary band Hamiltonians (multi-Weyl semimetals and AB bilayer graphene) to obtain the Loschmidt echo after a quench for an arbitrary starting state and find that the results readily generalize to find transmission amplitudes and specific contributions to the partition function, too. We then test our methods on many body spin and fermionic Hamiltonians and find that while the approach still offers advantages, more care has to be taken than in a generic case.</description>

      <title>Random Sequential Adsorption with Correlated Defects: A Series Expansion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) problem holds crucial theoretical and practical significance, serving as a pivotal framework for understanding and optimizing particle packing in various scientific and technological applications. Here the problem of the one-dimensional RSA of k-mers onto a substrate with correlated defects controlled by uniform and power-law distributions is theoretically investigated: the coverage fraction is obtained as a function of the density of defects and several scaling laws are examined. The results are compared with extensive Monte Carlo simulations and more traditional methods based on master equations. Emphasis is given in elucidating the scaling behavior of the fluctuations of the coverage fraction. The phenomenon of universality breaking and the issues of conventional gaussian fluctuations and the L\'evy type fluctuations from a simple perspective, relying on the Central Limit Theorem, are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Convergence, and lack of convergence, of phase space distributions to microcanonical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that phase space distribution functions obeying Liouville's theorem can converge weakly, but not strongly, to the microcanonical distribution. Similarly, coarse-grained distributions can converge pointwise, although unlike weak convergence, coarse-graining involves an arbitrary partition of phase space. We prove a theorem that strengthens the result that strong convergence cannot occur. Specifically, we show that time evolution is an isometry for a broad class of metrics of statistical distance on the space of phase space distributions. We also compare the physical significance of both weak and strong convergence. Next, we generalize the definition of coarse-graining to remove the need for a partition of phase space. This generalized coarse-graining is similar to E.T. Jaynes' maximum entropy distribution, but with an important difference. Much of the literature on the dynamics of phase space distributions is focused on providing a rigorous description of thermalization and the 2nd law of thermodynamics; meanwhile, a separate body of literature questions the relevance of weak convergence to thermalization. We aim to clarify this disagreement by specifying more clearly the scenarios in which weak convergence is, and is not, relevant.</description>

      <title>Relaxed hydrodynamic theory of electrically driven non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics, as an effective theory capturing long-wavelength and late-time dynamics around thermal equilibrium states, finds applications in diverse physical systems, ranging from electron flow in metals, to ocean wave propagation, traffic flow, bacterial motion and the quark-gluon plasma. On the other hand, non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), characterized by a stationary flow of energy or matter in the presence of a driving force, are pervasive in nature but they present significant challenges to the foundational principles of statistical physics, as it is generally unclear if and how they satisfy the axiomatic assumptions of thermodynamics. The capability of hydrodynamics to accurately describe slow and long-wavelength fluctuations around a NESS remains an open question. In this study, we provide positive evidence by specifically addressing electrically driven non-equilibrium charged steady states. Our approach involves introducing gapped modes and extending the effective description into a relaxed hydrodynamic theory (RHT). Leveraging the gauge-gravity duality as a tool for controlled computations within non-equilibrium systems, we establish an ultraviolet complete model for these NESS that confirms the validity of our RHT. In summary, our findings present a concrete realization of a RHT applicable to a NESS. This expands the regime of validity of hydrodynamics beyond thermal equilibrium, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>ATP-Dependent Mismatch Recognition in DNA Replication Mismatch Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03026v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mismatch repair is a critical step in DNA replication that occurs after base selection and proofreading, significantly increasing fidelity. However, the mechanism of mismatch recognition has not been established for any repair enzyme. Speculations in this area mainly focus on exploiting thermodynamic equilibrium and free energy. Nevertheless, non-equilibrium processes may play a more significant role in enhancing mismatch recognition accuracy by utilizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This study aimed to investigate this possibility. Considering our limited knowledge of actual mismatch repair enzymes, we proposed a hypothetical enzyme that operates as a quantum system with three discrete energy levels. When the enzyme is raised to its highest energy level, a quantum transition occurs, leading to one of two low-energy levels representing potential recognition outcomes: a correct match or a mismatch. The probabilities of the two outcomes are exponentially different, determined by the energy gap between the two low energy levels. By flipping the energy gap, discrimination between mismatches and correct matches can be achieved. Within a framework that combines quantum mechanics with thermodynamics, we established a relationship between energy cost and the recognition error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we report a complex scalar field dynamics in a $2+1$ dimensional black hole background can provide a scheme to study the pattern formation process in $1+1$ dimensional reaction-diffusion systems. The patterns include plane wave, defect turbulence, phase turbulence, spatio-temporal intermittency where defect chaos coexists with stable plane wave, and coherent structures. A phase diagram is obtained by studying the linear instability of the plane wave solutions to determine the onset of the holographic version of the Benjamin-Feir instability near a supercritical Hopf bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of fragmentation for periodically driven fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possible signatures of prethermal strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) for one-dimensional (1D) fermions subjected to a periodic drive. We extend the results of Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 120401 (2023) to show the possibility of such fragmentation for a large class of experimentally relevant drive protocols. Moreover, we demonstrate the persistence of HSF when the fermion chain is taken away from half-filling. Both these analysis indicate the robustness of the fragmentation phenomenon reported earlier. We also provide an alternate derivation of the Floquet Hamiltonian of the driven chain which yields insight into the generic nested commutator structure of its higher order terms. Finally, we study the density-density out-of-time-correlators (OTOC) of the driven chain both away and near the special drive frequencies at which its first order Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits fragmentation. We show that these OTOCs, for a chain with open boundary condition, exhibit a distinct periodic unscrambling of information at special drive frequencies; such unscrambling can therefore serve as a marker of prethermal HSF. We provide an approximate analytic explanation of the role of HSF behind such periodic unscrambling and discuss experiments which can detect signatures of strong HSF in such driven chains.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling behaviors of bipartite fluctuations $\mathcal{F}$ of conserved quantities across a class of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions out of Landau fermi liquids, where other phases involve fermi-surface states of fractionalized degrees of freedom. Examples of such phases include (compressible) composite fermi liquids for spinless electrons and (incompressible) spin-liquid Mott insulators for spin-$1/2$ electrons. The two sides of the critical points are typically distinguished by distinct leading-order scalings of bipartite charge fluctuations, $\mathcal{F}\sim L\log (L)$ in Landau fermi liquids, and $\mathcal{F}\sim L$ in the other phases, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem under bipartition. In the case of composite fermi liquids (with continuous translational and rotational invariance), we also identify a universal constant term $-\mathtt{F}(\theta)\sigma_{xy}/\pi$ arising when the subsystem geometry incorporates a sharp corner. Here, $\mathtt{F}(\theta)$ represents a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ denotes the Hall conductivity. At the critical point of each example, we find that the leading-order scaling $\mathcal{F}\sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\mathtt{F}(\theta)C_{\rho}\log(L)$ with the same angle dependence $\mathtt{F}(\theta)$. The universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is linked to the predicted universal longitudinal (and Hall) resistivity jump $\Delta\rho_{xx}$ (and $\Delta\rho_{xy}$) at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field on Quantum Phase Space: A Century after Ehrenfest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic transition dynamics lies at the core of many electron/hole transfer, photoactivated, and vacuum field-coupled processes. About a century after Ehrenfest proposed "Phasenraum" and the Ehrenfest theorem, we report a conceptually novel trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics approach, nonadiabatic field (NaF), based on a generalized exact coordinate-momentum phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. It does not employ the conventional Born-Oppenheimer or Ehrenfest trajectory in the nonadiabatic coupling region. Instead, in NaF the equations of motion of the independent trajectory involve a nonadiabatic nuclear force term in addition to an adiabatic nuclear force term of a single electronic state. A few benchmark tests for gas phase and condensed phase systems indicate that NaF offers a practical tool to capture the correct correlation of electronic and nuclear dynamics for processes where the states remain coupled all the time as well as for the asymptotic region where the coupling of electronic states vanishes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use constraint phase space [developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501], non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit empirically proposed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>Universal energy fluctuations in inelastic scattering processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum scattering is used ubiquitously in both experimental and theoretical physics across a wide range of disciplines, from high-energy physics to mesoscopic physics. In this work, we uncover universal relations for the energy fluctuations of a quantum system scattering inelastically with a particle at arbitrary kinetic energies. In particular, we prove a fluctuation relation describing an asymmetry between energy absorbing and releasing processes which relies on the non-unital nature of the underlying quantum map. This allows us to derive a bound on the average energy exchanged. We find that energy releasing processes are dominant when the kinetic energy of the particle is comparable to the system energies, but are forbidden at very high kinetic energies where well known fluctuation relations are recovered. Our work provides a unified view of energy fluctuations when the source driving the system is not macroscopic but rather an auxiliary quantum particle in a scattering process.</description>

      <title>Near-critical dark opalescence in out-of-equilibrium SF$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first-order phase transition between the liquid and gaseous phases ends at a critical point. Critical opalescence occurs at this singularity. Discovered in 1822, it is known to be driven by diverging fluctuations in the density. During the past two decades, boundaries between the gas-like and liquid-like regimes have been theoretically proposed and experimentally explored. Here, we show that fast cooling of near-critical sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$), in presence of Earth's gravity, favors dark opalescence, where visible photons are not merely scattered, but also absorbed. When the isochore fluid is quenched across the critical point, its optical transmittance drops by more than three orders of magnitude in the whole visible range, a feature which does not occur during slow cooling. We show that transmittance shows a dip at 2eV near the critical point, and the system can host excitons with binding energies ranging from 0.5 to 4 eV. The spinodal decomposition of the liquid-gas mixture, by inducing a periodical modulation of the fluid density, can provide a scenario to explain the emergence of this platform for coupling between light and matter. The possible formation of excitons and polaritons points to the irruption of quantum effects in a quintessentially classical context.</description>

      <title>Energy exchange statistics and fluctuation theorem for non-thermal asymptotic states</title>

Abstract: Exchange energy statistics between two bodies at different thermal equilibrium obey the Jarzynski-W\'ojcik fluctuation theorem. The corresponding energy scale factor is the difference of the inverse temperatures associated to the bodies at equilibrium. In this work, we consider a dissipative quantum dynamics leading the quantum system towards a, possibly non-thermal, asymptotic state. To generalize the Jarzynski-W\'ojcik theorem to non-thermal states, we identify a sufficient condition ${\cal I}$ for the existence of an energy scale factor $\eta^{*}$ that is unique, finite and time-independent, such that the characteristic function of the exchange energy distribution becomes identically equal to $1$ for any time. This $\eta^*$ plays the role of the difference of inverse temperatures. We discuss the physical interpretation of the condition ${\cal I}$, showing that it amounts to an almost complete memory loss of the initial state. The robustness of our results against quantifiable deviations from the validity of ${\cal I}$ is evaluated by experimental studies on a single nitrogen-vacancy center subjected to a sequence of laser pulses and dissipation.</description>

      <title>Emergent polar order in non-polar mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological rules that govern the collective behaviour of complex physical systems are powerful tools because they can make concrete predictions about their universality class based on generic considerations, such as symmetries, conservation laws, and dimensionality. While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behaviour of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with non-reciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner-Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory -- which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms -- belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar non-reciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field with Triangle Window Functions on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>

      <title>Level-Set Percolation of Gaussian Random Fields on Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit solution of the problem of level-set percolation for multivariate Gaussians defined in terms of weighted graph Laplacians on complex networks. The solution requires an analysis of the heterogeneous micro-structure of the percolation problem, i.e., a self-consistent determination of locally varying percolation probabilities. This is achieved using a cavity or message passing approach. It can be evaluated, both for single large instances of locally tree-like graphs, and in the thermodynamic limit of random graphs of finite mean degree in the configuration model class.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of a time rondeau crystal: Temporal Disorder in Spatiotemporal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of phases of matter relies on symmetry breaking, one example being water ice whose crystalline structure breaks the continuous translation symmetry of space. Recently, breaking of time translation symmetry was observed in systems not in thermal equilibrium. The associated notion of time crystallinity has led to a surge of interest, raising the question about the extent to which highly controllable quantum simulators can generate rich and tunable temporal orders, beyond the conventional classification of order in static systems. Here, we investigate different kinds of partial temporal orders, stabilized by non-periodic yet structured drives, which we call rondeau order. Using a $^{13}$C-nuclear-spin diamond quantum simulator, we report the first experimental observation of a -- tunable degree of -- short-time disorder in a system exhibiting long-time stroboscopic order. This is based on a novel spin control architecture that allows us to implement a family of drives ranging from structureless via structured random to quasiperiodic and periodic drives. Leveraging a high throughput read-out scheme, we continuously observe the spin polarization over 105 pulses to probe rondeau order, with controllable lifetimes exceeding 4 seconds. Using the freedom in the short-time temporal disorder of rondeau order, we show the capacity to encode information in the response of observables. Our work broadens the landscape of observed nonequilibrium temporal order, paving the way for new applications harnessing driven quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the inverse Ising problem with three-body interaction. Using the mean-field approximation, we find a tractable expansion of the normalizing constant. This facilitates estimation, which is known to be quite challenging for the Ising model. We then develop a novel hybrid MCMC algorithm that integrates Adaptive Metropolis Hastings (AMH), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), and the Manifold-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA), which converges quickly and mixes well. We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm using data simulated with a structure under which parameter estimation is known to be challenging, such as in the presence of a phase transition and at the critical point of the system.</description>

      <title>On data and dimension in chemistry I -- irreversibility, concealment and emergent conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical systems are interpreted through the species they contain and the reactions they may undergo, i.e., their chemical reaction network (CRN). In spite of their central importance to chemistry, the structure of CRNs continues to be challenging to deduce from data. Although there exist structural laws relating species, reactions, conserved quantities and cycles, there has been limited attention to their measurable consequences. One such is the dimension of the chemical data: the number of independent reactions, i.e. the number of measured variables minus the number of constraints. In this paper we attempt to relate the experimentally observed dimension to the structure of the CRN. In particular, we investigate the effects of species that are concealed and reactions that are irreversible. For instance, irreversible reactions can have proportional rates. The resulting reduction in degrees of freedom can be captured by the co-production law, relating co-production relations to emergent non-integer conservation laws and broken cycles. This law resolves a recent conundrum posed by a machine-discovered candidate for a non-integer conservation law. We also obtain laws that allow us to relate data dimension to network structure in cases where some species cannot be discerned or distinguished by a given analytical technique, allowing to better narrow down what CRNs can underly experimental data.</description>

Abstract: We study two non-Markovian gene-expression models in which protein production is a stochastic process with a fat-tailed non-exponential waiting time distribution (WTD). For both models, we find two distinct scaling regimes separated by an exponentially long time, proportional to the mean first passage time (MFPT) to a ground state (with zero proteins) of the dynamics, from which the system can only exit via a non-exponential reaction. At times shorter than the MFPT the dynamics are stationary and ergodic, entailing similarity across different realizations of the same process, with an increased Fano factor of the protein distribution, even when the WTD has a finite cutoff. Notably, at times longer than the MFPT the dynamics are nonstationary and nonergodic, entailing significant variability across different realizations. The MFPT to the ground state is shown to directly affect the average population sizes and we postulate that the transition to nonergodicity is universal in such non-Markovian models.</description>

      <title>Similarity between a many-body quantum avalanche model and the ultrametric random matrix model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of ergodicity-breaking phases, it has been recognized that quantum avalanches can destabilize many-body localization at a wide range of disorder strengths. This has in particular been demonstrated by the numerical study of a toy model, sometimes simply called the "avalanche model" or the "quantum sun model" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 060602 (2022)], which consists of an ergodic seed coupled to a perfectly localized material. In this paper, we connect this toy model to a well-studied model in random matrix theory, the ultrametric ensemble. We conjecture that the models share the following features. 1) The location of the critical point may be predicted sharply by analytics. 2) On the localized site, both models exhibit Fock space localization. 3) There is a manifold of critical points. On the critical manifold, the eigenvectors exhibit nontrivial multifractal behaviour that can be tuned by moving on the manifold. 4) The spectral statistics at criticality is intermediate between Poisson statistics and random matrix statistics, also tunable on the critical manifold. We confirm numerically these properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markovian open many-body quantum systems display complicated relaxation dynamics. The spectral gap of the Liouvillian characterizes the asymptotic decay rate towards the stationary state, but it has recently been pointed out that the spectral gap does not necessarily determine the overall relaxation time. Our understanding on the relaxation process before the asymptotically long-time regime is still limited. We here present a collective relaxation dynamics of autocorrelation functions in the stationary state. As a key quantity in the analysis, we introduce the instantaneous decay rate, which characterizes the transient relaxation and converges to the conventional asymptotic decay rate in the long-time limit. Our theory predicts that a bulk-dissipated system generically shows an accelerated decay before the asymptotic regime due to the scrambling of quantum information associated with the operator spreading.</description>

      <title>Effect of Constraint Relaxation on the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A statistical-mechanical study of the effect of constraint relaxation on the minimum vertex cover problem in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs is presented. Using a penalty-method formulation for constraint relaxation, typical properties of solutions, including infeasible solutions that violate the constraints, are analyzed by means of the replica method and cavity method. The problem involves a competition between reducing the number of vertices to be covered and satisfying the edge constraints. The analysis under the replica-symmetric (RS) ansatz clarifies that the competition leads to degeneracies in the vertex and edge states, which determine the quantitative properties of the system, such as the cover and penalty ratios. A precise analysis of these effects improves the accuracy of RS approximation for the minimum cover ratio in the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) region. Furthermore, the analysis based on the RS cavity method indicates that the RS/RSB boundary of the ground states with respect to the mean degree of the graphs is expanded, and the critical temperature is lowered by constraint relaxation.</description>

      <title>Optimal finite-differences discretization for the diffusion equation from the perspective of large-deviation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When applying the finite-differences method to numerically solve the one-dimensional diffusion equation, one must choose discretization steps $\Delta x$, $\Delta t$ in space and time, respectively. By applying large-deviation theory on the discretized dynamics, we analyze the numerical errors due to the discretization, and find that the (relative) errors are especially large in regions of space where the concentration of particles is very small. We find that the choice $\Delta t = {\Delta x}^2 / (6D)$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, gives optimal accuracy compared to any other choice (including, in particular, the limit $\Delta t \to 0$), thus reproducing the known result that may be obtained using truncation error analysis. In addition, we give quantitative estimates for the dynamical lengthscale that describes the size of the spatial region in which the numerical solution is accurate, and study its dependence on the discretization parameters. We then turn to study the advection-diffusion equation, and obtain explicit expressions for the optimal $\Delta t$ and other parameters of the finite-differences scheme, in terms of $\Delta x$, $D$ and the advection velocity. We apply these results to study large deviations of the area swept by a diffusing particle in one dimension, trapped by an external potential $\sim |x|$. We extend our analysis to higher dimensions by combining our results from the one dimensional case with the locally one-dimension method.</description>

Abstract: Entropy production and dynamical activity are two complementary aspects in nonequilibrium physics. The asymmetry of cross-correlation, serving as a distinctive feature of nonequilibrium, also finds widespread utility. In this Letter, we establish two thermodynamic bounds on the normalized asymmetry of cross-correlation in terms of dynamical activity and entropy production rate. These bounds demonstrate broad applicability, and offer experimental testability.</description>

Abstract: In a previous work [A simplified Parisi Ansatz, Franchini, S., Commun. Theor. Phys., 73, 055601 (2021)] we introduced a simple method to compute the Random Overlap Structure of Aizenmann, Simm and Stars and the full-RSB Parisi formula for the Sherrington-Kirckpatrick Model without using replica theory. The method consists in partitioning the system into smaller sub-systems that we call layers, and iterate the Bayes rule. A central ansatz in our derivation was that these layers could be approximated by Random Energy Models of the Derrida type. In this paper we analyze the properties of the interface in detail, and show the equivalence with the Random Energy Model at any temperature.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems, by considering a quasiprobability distribution of work. To do this, we formulate and examine the implications of a detailed fluctuation theorem, which reproduces the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confined active particles constitute simple, yet realistic, examples of systems that converge into a non-equilibrium steady state. We investigate a run-and-tumble particle in one spatial dimension, trapped by an external potential, with a given distribution $g(t)$ of waiting times between tumbling events whose mean value is equal to $\tau$. Unless $g(t)$ is an exponential distribution (corresponding to a constant tumbling rate), the process is non-Markovian, which makes the analysis of the model particularly challenging. We use an analytical framework involving effective position-dependent tumbling rates, to develop a numerical method that yields the full steady-state distribution (SSD) of the particle's position. The method is very efficient and requires modest computing resources, including in the large-deviations and/or small-$\tau$ regime, where the SSD can be related to the the large-deviation function, $s(x)$, via the scaling relation $P_{{\rm st}}(x)\sim e^{-s\left(x\right)/\tau}$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Predictive Theories through Integrating Quantum, Statistical, Equilibrium, and Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's thermodynamics is largely based on the combined law for equilibrium systems and statistical mechanics derived by Gibbs in 1873 and 1901, respectively, while irreversible thermodynamics for nonequilibrium systems resides essentially on the Onsager Theorem as a separate branch of thermodynamics developed in 1930s. Between them, quantum mechanics was invented and was quantitatively solved in terms of density functional theory (DFT) in 1960s. These three scientific domains operate based on different principles and are very much separated from each other. In analogy to the parable of the blind men and the elephant articulated by Perdew, they individually represent different portions of a complex system and thus are incomplete by themselves alone, resulting in the lack of quantitative agreement between their predictions and experimental observations. Over the last two decades, the author's group has developed a multiscale entropy approach (recently termed as zentropy theory) that integrates DFT-based quantum mechanics and Gibbs statistical mechanics and is capable of accurately predicting entropy and free energy of complex systems. Furthermore, in combination with the combined law for nonequilibrium systems developed by Hillert, the author developed the theory of cross phenomena beyond the phenomenological Onsager Theorem. The zentropy theory and theory of cross phenomena jointly provide quantitative predictive theories for systems from electronic to any observable scales as reviewed in the present work.</description>

      <title>Emus live on the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa archipelago</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is expected that the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) chiral Ising transition of $N$ Majorana (or $N_f=N/4$ four-component Dirac) fermions coupled with scalar field in (2+1)D will be the first fermionic quantum critical point that various methods such as conformal bootstrap [1], perturbative renormalization group [2] and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations [3], would yield the converged critical exponents -- serving the same textbook role as the Ising and $O(N)$ models in the statistical and quantum phase transition. However, such expectation has not been fully realized from the lattice QMC simulations due to the obstacles introduced by the UV finite size effect. In this work, by means of the elective-momentum ultra-size (EMUS) QMC method [4], we compute the critical exponents of the GNY $N=8$ chiral Ising transition on a 2D $\pi$-flux fermion lattice model between Dirac semimetal and quantum spin Hall insulator phases [3, 5]. With the matching of fermionic and bosonic momentum transfer and collective update in momentum space, our QMC results provide the fully consistent exponents with those obtained from the bootstrap and perturbative approaches. In this way, the Emus now live happily on the $N=8$ island and could explore the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa archipelago [1] with ease.</description>

      <title>Universality in the 2d quasi-periodic Ising model and Harris-Luck irrelevance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in the 2d Ising Model with a weak bidimensional quasi-periodic disorder in the interaction, the critical behavior is the same as in the non-disordered case, that is the critical exponents for the specific heat and energy-energy correlations are identical and no logarithmic corrections are present. The disorder produces a quasi-periodic modulation of the amplitude of the correlations and a renormalization of the velocities, that is the coefficients of the rescaling of positions, and of the critical temperature. The result establishes the validity of the prediction based on the Harris-Luck criterion and it provides the first rigorous proof of universality in the Ising model in presence of quasi-periodic disorder in both directions and for any angle. Small divisors are controlled assuming a Diophantine condition on the frequencies and convergence of the series is proved by Renormalization Group analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a Josephson-coupled Jaynes-Cummings dimer in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity, which can be realized in the cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics systems. The semiclassical dynamics is analyzed systematically to chart out a variety of photonic Josephson oscillations and their regime of stability. Different types of transitions between the dynamical states lead to the self-trapping phenomenon, which results in photon population imbalance between the two cavities. We also study the dynamics quantum mechanically to identify characteristic features of different steady states and to explore fascinating quantum effects, such as spin dephasing, phase fluctuation, and revival phenomena of the photon field, as well as the entanglement of spin qubits. For a particular "self-trapped" state, the mutual information between the atomic qubits exhibits a direct correlation with the photon population imbalance, which is promising for generating photon mediated entanglement between two non interacting qubits in a controlled manner. Under a sudden quench from stable to unstable regime, the photon distribution exhibits phase space mixing with a rapid loss of coherence, resembling a thermal state. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the new results in experiments, which can have applications in quantum information processing and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Learnability transitions in monitored quantum dynamics via eavesdropper's classical shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum dynamics -- unitary evolution interspersed with measurements -- has recently emerged as a rich domain for phase structure in quantum many-body systems away from equilibrium. Here we study monitored dynamics from the point of view of an eavesdropper who has access to the classical measurement outcomes, but not to the quantum many-body system. We show that a measure of information flow from the quantum system to the classical measurement record -- the informational power -- undergoes a phase transition in correspondence with the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). This transition determines the eavesdropper's (in)ability to learn properties of an unknown initial quantum state of the system, given a complete classical description of the monitored dynamics and arbitrary classical computational resources. We make this learnability transition concrete by defining classical shadows protocols that the eavesdropper may apply to this problem, and show that the MIPT manifests as a transition in the sample complexity of various shadow estimation tasks, which become harder in the low-measurement phase. We focus on three applications of interest: Pauli expectation values (where we find the MIPT appears as a point of optimal learnability for typical Pauli operators), many-body fidelity, and global charge in $U(1)$-symmetric dynamics. Our work unifies different manifestations of the MIPT under the umbrella of learnability and gives this notion a general operational meaning via classical shadows.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that integrability is an accidental property of generic two-dimensional $O(2)$-symmetric asymptotically-free theories in the regime where the charge density is much larger than the dynamical scale. We show this by constructing an infinite tower of higher-spin conserved currents in the most generic effective Lagrangian at large chemical potential to all orders in perturbative expansion in the renormalization-group invariant coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Remarks on effects of projective phase on eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of $p$-form symmetry in $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum field is known to always lead to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for certain $(d-p)$-dimensional operators other than symmetry operators under some assumptions. The assumptions include the mixing of symmetry sectors within a given energy shell, which is rather challenging to verify because it requires information on the eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum. We reconsider this assumption from the viewpoint of projective representations to avoid this difficulty. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries, we can circumvent the difficulty by considering $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric theories with nontrivial projective phases, and perturbing the Hamiltonian while preserving one of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of our interest. We also perform numerical analyses for $(1+1)$-dimensional spin chains and the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, topology, duality, chirality, and criticality in a spin-1/2 XXZ ladder with a four-spin interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of a spin-1/2 XXZ model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder. This model offers a minimal setup to study an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. The spin-chirality duality transformation allows us to relate the regimes of weak and strong CCIs. By applying the Abelian bosonization and the duality, we obtain a rich phase diagram that contains distinct gapped featureless and ordered phases. In particular, Neel and vector chiral orders appear for easy-axis anisotropy, while two distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases appear for easy-plane anisotropy. The two SPT phases can be viewed as twisted variants of the Haldane phase. We also present an effective description in terms of (spinor) hard-core bosons, which reveals critical behavior on the self-dual line in the easy-axis and easy-plane regimes. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties. We further demonstrate that the two SPT phases and a trivial phase are distinguished by topological indices in the presence of certain symmetries. A similar phase structure is expected in a spin-1/2 XXZ ladder with four-spin ring exchange.</description>

      <title>Optimal work extraction from quantum batteries based on the expected utility hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Work extraction in quantum finite systems is an important issue in quantum thermodynamics. The optimal work extracted is called ergotropy, and it is achieved by maximizing the average work extracted over all the unitary cycles. However, an agent that is non-neutral to risk is affected by fluctuations and should extract work by following the expected utility hypothesis. Thus, we investigate the optimal work extraction performed by a risk non-neutral agent by maximizing the average utility function over all the unitary cycles. We mainly focus on initial states that are incoherent with respect to the energy basis, achieving a probability distribution of work. In this case we show how the optimal work extraction will be performed with an incoherent unitary transformation, namely a permutation of the energy basis, which depends on the risk aversion of the agent. We give several examples, in particular also the work extraction from an ensemble of quantum batteries is examined. Furthermore, we also investigate how work extraction is affected by the presence of initial quantum coherence in the energy basis by considering a quasiprobability distribution of work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse surface-fluctuations-driven fluid flow through nano-channels to investigate the interplay between boundary layer flow structures and the bulk flow of fluid under a pressure-head. Surface fluctuations of a wide range of frequencies (up to several thousands of Hertz) in a nano-channel keep the flow in the low Reynolds number regime. Using this advantage of low Reynolds number flow, we develop a perturbation analysis of the fluid flow that clearly distinguishes the bulk flow under a pressure head around the axis of a nano-tube from its surface flow structure induced by fluctuations. In terms of particle transport under such flow conditions, there exists the opportunity to drag particles near the periphery of the nano-tube in a direction opposite to the bulk flow near the axis. This can potentially find applications in the separation, trapping, and filtration of particles under surface-driven flow through nano-tubes under widely varying conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a generalized interpolating Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Fibonacci (IAAF) model with p-wave superconducting pairing. In the Aubry-Andr\'{e} limit, we demonstrate that the system experiences transitions from a pure phase, either extended or critical, to a variety of intermediate phases and ultimately enters a localized phase with increasing potential strength. These intermediate phases include those with coexisting extended and localized states, extended and critical states, localized and critical states and a mix of extended, critical and localized states. Each intermediate phase exhibits at least one type of mobility edge separating different states. As the system approaches the Fibonacci limit, both the extended and localized phases diminish, and the system tends towards a critical phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a binary mixture of chemically active particles, that produce or consume solute molecules, and that interact with each other through the long-range concentrations fields they generate. We analytically calculate the effective phoretic mobility of these particles when the mixture is submitted to a constant, external concentration gradient, at leading order in the overall concentration. Relying on a analogy with the modeling of strong electrolytes, we show that the effective phoretic mobility decays with the square-root of the concentration: our result is therefore a nonequilibrium counterpart to the celebrated Kohlrausch and Debye-H\"uckel-Onsager conductivity laws for electrolytes, which are extended here to particles with long-range nonreciprocal interactions. The effective mobility law we derive reveals the existence of a regime of maximal mobility, and could find applications in the description of nanoscale transport phenomena in living cells.</description>

Abstract: Decades ago, Gurzhi proposed that if momentum-conserving collisions prevail among heat-carrying phonons in insulators and charge-carrying electrons in metals, hydrodynamic features will become detectable. In this paper, we will review the experimental evidence emerging in the last few years supporting this viewpoint and raising new questions. The focus of the paper will be bulk crystals without (or with a very dilute concentration) of mobile electrons and steady-state thermal transport. We will also discuss the possible link between this field of investigation and other phenomena, such as the hybridization of phonon modes and the phonon thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <title>Computing macroscopic reaction rates in reaction-diffusion systems using Monte Carlo simulations</title>

Abstract: Stochastic reaction-diffusion models are employed to represent many complex physical, biological, societal, and ecological systems. The macroscopic reaction rates describing the large-scale kinetics in such systems are effective, scale-dependent parameters that need to be either measured experimentally or computed using a microscopic model. In a Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, microscopic probabilities for specific events to happen serve as the input control parameters. Finding the functional dependence of emergent macroscopic rates on the microscopic probabilities is a difficult problem, and there is no systematic analytical way to achieve this goal. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward numerical method of using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the macroscopic reaction rates by directly obtaining the count statistics of how many events occur per simulation time step. Our technique is first tested on well-understood fundamental examples, namely restricted birth processes, diffusion-limited two-particle coagulation, and two-species pair annihilation kinetics. Next we utilize the thus gained experience to investigate how the microscopic algorithmic probabilities become coarse-grained into effective macroscopic rates in more complex model systems such as the Lotka--Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence, as well as the rock-paper-scissors or cyclic Lotka--Volterra model as well as its May--Leonard variant that capture population dynamics with cyclic dominance motifs. Thereby we achieve a deeper understanding of coarse-graining in spatially extended stochastic reaction systems and the nontrivial relationships between the associated microscopic and macroscopic model parameters. The proposed technique should generally provide a useful means to better fit Monte Carlo simulation results to experimental or observational data.</description>
