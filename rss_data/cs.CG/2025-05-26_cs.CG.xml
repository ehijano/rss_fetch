      <title>On the geometric $k$-colored crossing number of $K_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the \emph{geometric $k$-colored crossing number} of complete graphs $\overline{\overline{\text{cr}}}_k(K_n)$, which is the smallest number of monochromatic crossings in any $k$-edge colored straight-line drawing of $K_n$.
  We substantially improve asymptotic upper bounds on $\overline{\overline{\text{cr}}}_k(K_n)$ for $k=2,\ldots, 10$ by developing a procedure for general $k$ that derives $k$-edge colored drawings of $K_n$ for arbitrarily large $n$ from initial drawings with a low number of monochromatic crossings.
  We obtain the latter by heuristic search, employing a \textsc{MAX-$k$-CUT}-formulation of a subproblem in the process.</description>

      <title>Pruning vineyards: updating barcodes and representative cycles by removing simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03925v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The barcode of a filtration and its representative cycles encode rich information often useful in data analysis. However, obtaining them can be computationally expensive. Therefore, it is useful to have methods that update them if the associated filtration undergoes small changes. There are already efficient algorithms updating a barcode if simplices exchange entrance order or are added, but not if simplices are removed. We provide an implementation to update a reduced boundary matrix when simplices in the filtration are removed. Our algorithm, the Simplicial Removal Update Procedure (SiRUP), intrinsically updates also the representative cycles, and is compatible with the twist optimizations. We show that the complexity of our algorithm is lower than recomputing the barcode from scratch and that the number of executed matrix column additions is minimal, with both theoretical and experimental methods.</description>

      <title>Faster, Deterministic and Space Efficient Subtrajectory Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a trajectory $T$ and a distance $\Delta$, we wish to find a set $C$ of curves of complexity at most $\ell$, such that we can cover $T$ with subcurves that each are within Fr\'echet distance $\Delta$ to at least one curve in $C$. We call $C$ an $(\ell,\Delta)$-clustering and aim to find an $(\ell,\Delta)$-clustering of minimum cardinality. This problem variant was introduced by Akitaya $et$ $al.$ (2021) and shown to be NP-complete. The main focus has therefore been on bicriteria approximation algorithms, allowing for the clustering to be an $(\ell, \Theta(\Delta))$-clustering of roughly optimal size.
  We present algorithms that construct $(\ell,4\Delta)$-clusterings of $\mathcal{O}(k \log n)$ size, where $k$ is the size of the optimal $(\ell, \Delta)$-clustering. We use $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ space and $\mathcal{O}(k n^3 \log^4 n)$ time. Our algorithms significantly improve upon the clustering quality (improving the approximation factor in $\Delta$) and size (whenever $\ell \in \Omega(\log n / \log k)$). We offer deterministic running times improving known expected bounds by a factor near-linear in $\ell$. Additionally, we match the space usage of prior work, and improve it substantially, by a factor super-linear in $n\ell$, when compared to deterministic results.</description>

      <title>Detecting Spatial Dependence in Transcriptomics Data using Vectorised Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating spatial patterns in data is an integral task across various domains, including geostatistics, astronomy, and spatial tissue biology. The analysis of transcriptomics data in particular relies on methods for detecting spatially-dependent features that exhibit significant spatial patterns for both explanatory analysis and feature selection. However, given the complex and high-dimensional nature of these data, there is a need for robust, stable, and reliable descriptors of spatial dependence. We leverage the stability and multiscale properties of persistent homology to address this task. To this end, we introduce a novel framework using functional topological summaries, such as Betti curves and persistence landscapes, for identifying and describing non-random patterns in spatial data. In particular, we propose a non-parametric one-sample permutation test for spatial dependence and investigate its utility across both simulated and real spatial omics data. Our vectorised approach outperforms baseline methods at accurately detecting spatial dependence. Further, we find that our method is more robust to outliers than alternative tests using Moran's I.</description>
