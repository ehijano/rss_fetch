      <title>Network Analysis of Uniswap: Centralization and Fragility in the Decentralized Exchange Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Uniswap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocol that facilitates automatic token exchange without the need for traditional order books. Every pair of tokens forms a liquidity pool on Uniswap, and each token can be paired with any other token to create liquidity pools. This characteristic motivates us to employ a complex network approach to analyze the features of the Uniswap market. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the Uniswap network using complex network methods. The network on October 31, 2023, is built to observe its recent features, showcasing both scale-free and core-periphery properties. By employing node and edge-betweenness metrics, we detect the most important tokens and liquidity pools. Additionally, we construct daily networks spanning from the beginning of Uniswap V2 on May 5, 2020, until October 31, 2023, and our findings demonstrate that the network becomes increasingly fragile over time. Furthermore, we conduct a robustness analysis by simulating the deletion of nodes to estimate the impact of some extreme events such as the Terra collapse. The results indicate that the Uniswap network exhibits robustness, yet it is notably fragile when deleting tokens with high betweenness centrality. This finding highlights that, despite being a decentralized exchange, Uniswap exhibits significant centralization tendencies in terms of token network connectivity and the distribution of TVL across nodes (tokens) and edges (liquidity pools).</description>

      <title>What is missing from existing Lithium-Sulfur models to capture coin-cell behaviour?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer a promising alternative to current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, with a high theoretical energy density, improved safety and high abundance, low cost of materials. For Li-S to reach commercial application, it is essential to understand how the behaviour scales between cell formats; new material development is predominately completed at coin-cell level, whilst pouch-cells will be used for commercial applications. Differences such as reduced electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratios and increased geometric size at larger cell formats contribute to the behavioural differences, in terms of achievable capacity, cyclability and potential degradation mechanisms.
  This work focuses on the steps required to capture and test coin-cell behaviour, building upon the existing models within the literature, which predominately focus on pouch-cells. The areas investigated throughout this study, to improve the capability of the model in terms of scaling ability and causality of predictions, include the cathode surface area, precipitation dynamics and C-rate dependence.</description>

      <title>XAI4Extremes: An interpretable machine learning framework for understanding extreme-weather precursors under climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. This, in turn, is exacting a significant toll in communities worldwide. While prediction skills are increasing with advances in numerical weather prediction and artificial intelligence tools, extreme weather still present challenges. More specifically, identifying the precursors of such extreme weather events and how these precursors may evolve under climate change remain unclear. In this paper, we propose to use post-hoc interpretability methods to construct relevance weather maps that show the key extreme-weather precursors identified by deep learning models. We then compare this machine view with existing domain knowledge to understand whether deep learning models identified patterns in data that may enrich our understanding of extreme-weather precursors. We finally bin these relevant maps into different multi-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on these precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but the methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events worldwide.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optimals and their role in sustaining turbulence in channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the energy transfer from the mean profile to velocity fluctuations in channel flow by calculating nonlinear optimal disturbances,i.e. the initial condition of a given finite energy that achieves the highest possible energy growth during a given fixed time horizon. It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</description>

      <title>Robust Aggregation of Electric Vehicle Flexiblity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of characterizing the aggregate flexibility in populations of electric vehicles (EVs) with uncertain charging requirements. Extending upon prior results that provide exact characterizations of aggregate flexibility in populations of electric vehicle (EVs), we adapt the framework to encompass more general charging requirements. In doing so we give a characterization of the exact aggregate flexibility as a generalized polymatroid. Furthermore, this paper advances these aggregation methodologies to address the case in which charging requirements are uncertain. In this extended framework, requirements are instead sampled from a specified distribution. In particular, we construct robust aggregate flexibility sets, sets of aggregate charging profiles over which we can provide probabilistic guarantees that actual realized populations will be able to track. By leveraging measure concentration results that establish powerful finite sample guarantees, we are able to give tight bounds on these robust flexibility sets, even in low sample regimes that are well suited for aggregating small populations of EVs. We detail explicit methods of calculating these sets. Finally, we provide numerical results that validate our results and case studies that demonstrate the applicability of the theory developed herein.</description>

      <title>Simplest Mechanism Builder Algorithm (SiMBA): An Automated Microkinetic Model Discovery Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microkinetic models are key for evaluating industrial processes' efficiency and chemicals' environmental impact. Manual construction of these models is difficult and time-consuming, prompting a shift to automated methods. This study introduces SiMBA (Simplest Mechanism Builder Algorithm), a novel approach for generating microkinetic models from kinetic data. SiMBA operates through four phases: mechanism generation, mechanism translation, parameter estimation, and model comparison. Our approach systematically proposes reaction mechanisms, using matrix representations and a parallelized backtracking algorithm to manage complexity. These mechanisms are then translated into microkinetic models represented by ordinary differential equations, and optimized to fit available data. Models are compared using information criteria to balance accuracy and complexity, iterating until convergence to an optimal model is reached. Case studies on an aldol condensation reaction, and the dehydration of fructose demonstrate SiMBA's effectiveness in distilling complex kinetic behaviors into simple yet accurate models. While SiMBA predicts intermediates correctly for all case studies, it does not chemically identify intermediates, requiring expert input for complex systems. Despite this, SiMBA significantly enhances mechanistic exploration, offering a robust initial mechanism that accelerates the development and modeling of chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</description>

      <title>RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</description>
