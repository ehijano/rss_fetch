      <title>Explanation to the article "On the calibration of ultra-high energy EASs at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed commentary on the energy calibration of the TA experiment described in our paper (arXiv:2404.16948 [astro-ph.HE]). That paper concludes that the TA energy estimation, which is tied to optical measurements, might be incorrect. A response from members of the TA Collaboration (arXiv:2407.12892 [astro-ph.HE]) states that this conclusion is wrong and "stems from a misinterpretation and an incorrect application of the TA energy deposit formula". Here we demonstrate that our formula for energy deposit is not in fact a rescaled modification of the TA equation, but follows from description of the processes occurring during the passage of charged particles through 1.2 cm thick scintillator. Our estimation of the TA detector response implies the correctness of the cosmic ray spectrum derived from readings of surface detectors of the array.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Reflection Modeling in AGN and Related Variability from PCA: A Brief Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveal relativistic reflections from the innermost regions of accretion disks, which contain general-relativistic footprints caused by spinning supermassive black holes (SMBH). We anticipate the spin of a SMBH to be stable over the human timeframe, so brightness changes in the high-energy corona above the SMBH should slightly alter relativistic reflection. In this brief review, we discuss the latest developments in modeling relativistic reflection, as well as the rapid small variation in relativistic emission disclosed by the principal component analysis (PCA) of X-ray variability in AGN. PCA studies of X-ray spectra from AGNs have shown that relativistically blurred reflection has negligible fluctuations over the course of observations, which could originate from rapid (intrahour) intrinsic variations in near-horizon accretion flows and photon rings. The PCA technique is an effective way to disclose relativistic reflection from X-ray observations of AGNs, simplifying the complexity of largely variable X-ray data for automated spectral analysis with machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>H-AMR FORGE'd in FIRE I: Magnetic state transitions, jet launching and radiative emission in super-Eddington, highly magnetized quasar disks formed from cosmological initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars are powered by supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disks, yet standard disk models are inconsistent with many quasar observations. Recently, Hopkins et al. (2024) simulated the formation of a quasar disk feeding a SMBH of mass $M=1.3\times10^7\,M_\odot$ in a host galaxy that evolved from cosmological initial conditions. The disk had surprisingly strong toroidal magnetic fields that supported it vertically from gravity and powered fast accretion. What radiation and feedback can such a system produce? To answer this, we must follow the gas to the event horizon. For this, we interpolated the accretion system onto the grid of the general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics code H-AMR and performed 3D simulations with BH spins $a=0$ and $a=0.9375$. This remapping generates spurious magnetic monopoles, which we erase using a novel divergence cleaning approach. Despite the toroidal magnetic field's dominance at large radii, vertical magnetic flux builds up at the event horizon. This causes a magnetic state transition within the inner $200$ gravitational radii of the disk, where net vertical magnetic flux begins dominating the accretion flow. This powers strong winds and, if the BH spins, relativistic jets that can spin-down the BH within $5-10\,{\rm Myrs}$. Sometimes, vertical magnetic fields of opposite sign reach the BH, causing polarity inversion events that briefly destroy the jets and, possibly, the X-ray corona. The disk powers accretion at rates $5\times$ the Eddington limit, which can double the BH mass in $5-10\,{\rm Myrs}$. When $a=0.9375$ ($a=0$), the energy in outflows and radiation equals about $60\%$ ($10\%$) and $100\%$ ($3\%$) of the accreted rest mass energy, respectively. Much of the light escapes in cool, extended $\gtrsim1300\,{\rm au}$ photospheres, consistent with quasar microlensing and the ``big blue bump'' seen in spectral energy distributions.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Characterization of Intermittency in Plasma Turbulence: Single and Double Sheet Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of turbulence in magnetized plasmas remains an unresolved problem. The most poorly understood aspect is intermittency -- spatio-temporal fluctuations superimposed on the self-similar turbulent motions. We employ a novel machine-learning analysis technique to segment turbulent flow structures into distinct clusters based on statistical similarities across multiple physical features. We find that the previously identified intermittent fluctuations consist of two distinct clusters: i) current sheets, thin slabs of electric current between merging flux ropes, and; ii) double sheets, pairs of oppositely polarized current slabs, possibly generated by two non-linearly interacting Alfv\'en-wave packets. The distinction is crucial for the construction of realistic turbulence sub-grid models.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Accretion and Spin-up Through Stellar Collisions in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical interactions in dense star clusters could significantly influence the properties of black holes, leaving imprints on their gravitational-wave signatures. While previous studies have mostly focused on repeated black hole mergers for spin and mass growth, this work examines the impact of physical collisions and close encounters between black holes and (non-compact) stars. Using Monte Carlo N-body models of dense star clusters, we find that a large fraction of black holes retained upon formation undergo collisions with stars. Within our explored cluster models, the proportion of binary black hole mergers affected by stellar collisions ranges from $10\%$ to $60\%$. If all stellar-mass black holes are initially non-spinning, we find that up to $40\%$ of merging binary black holes may have components with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi\gtrsim 0.2$ because of prior stellar collisions, while typically about $10\%$ have spins near $\chi = 0.7$ from prior black hole mergers. We demonstrate that young star clusters are especially important environments as they can produce collisions of black holes with very massive stars, allowing significant spin up of the black holes through accretion. Our predictions for black hole spin distributions from these stellar collisions highlight their sensitivity to accretion efficiency, underscoring the need for detailed hydrodynamic calculations to better understand the accretion physics following these interactions.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Persistent Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Accreting White Dwarfs: A New Link to X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all accreting black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems (XRBs) exhibit prominent brightness variations on a few characteristic time-scales and their harmonics. These quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are thought to be associated with the precession of a warped accretion disc, but the physical mechanism that generates the precessing warp remains uncertain. Relativistic frame dragging (Lense-Thirring precession) is one promising candidate, but a misaligned magnetic field is an alternative, especially for neutron star XRBs. Here, we report the discovery of 5 accreting white dwarf systems (AWDs) that display strong optical QPOs with characteristic frequencies and harmonic structures that suggest they are the counterpart of the QPOs seen in XRBs. Since AWDs are firmly in the classical (non-relativistic) regime, Lense-Thirring precession cannot account for these QPOs. By contrast, a weak magnetic field associated with the white dwarf can drive disc warping and precession in these systems, similar to what has been proposed for neutron star XRBs. Our observations confirm that magnetically driven warping is a viable mechanism for generating QPOs in disc-accreting astrophysical systems, certainly in AWDs and possibly also in (neutron star) XRBs. Additionally, they establish a new way to estimate magnetic field strengths, even in relatively weak-field systems where other methods are not available.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Low-Energy Electron Antineutrino Flux from the Brightest GRB of All Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron antinuetrino flux limits are presented for the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) of all time, GRB221009A, over a range of 1.8\,-\,200\,MeV using the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Anti Neutrino Detector (KamLAND). Using a variety of time windows to search for electron antineutrinos coincident with the GRB, we set an upper limit on the flux under the assumption of various neutrino source spectra. No excess was observed in any time windows ranging from seconds to days around the event trigger time. The limits are compared to the results presented by IceCube.</description>

      <title>Detection of Gamma-ray Halos around Nearby Late-type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various theoretical models predict existence of extended gamma-ray halo around normal galaxies, that could be produced by interactions of cosmic rays with the circumgalactic medium or by annihilation or decay of hypothetical dark matter particles. Observations of the closest massive galaxy M31 also corroborate this possibility. In this study we search for gamma-ray emission from the galaxies within 15 Mpc at energies higher than 2 GeV and try to assess its spatial extension. We use the latest catalog of local galaxies and apply a simple yet robust method of aperture photometry. By imposing the mass, energy, and spatial cuts, we selected a set of 16 late-type galaxies and found a statistically significant excess above the background level ($p-\mathrm{val}=4.8\times10^{-9}$). More importantly, our analysis shows that this excess can be ascribed to an extended source with a radius $\sim 0.3^\circ$ rather than a point-like one. In contrast, 6 early-type galaxies, which satisfied the same cuts, showed no excess. Our results are supported by the stacking likelihood analysis technique. The difference between the late- and early-type galaxies and a rather irregular shape of the extended source that we found indicate that this high-energy emission is not due to DM annihilation/decay but rather originates from cosmic ray interaction with the circumgalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Astroparticles from X-ray Binary Coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane implies an abundant population of hadronic cosmic-ray sources in the Milky Way. We explore the role of the coronae of accreting stellar-mass black holes as such astroparticle emitters. We show that the particle acceleration and interaction timescales in the coronal region are tied to the compactness of the X-ray source. Thus, neutrino emission processes may similarly happen in the cores of active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries (XRB), despite of their drastically different masses and physical sizes. We apply the model to the well-measured XRB Cygnus X-1 and find that the cascaded gamma rays accompanying the neutrino emission naturally explain the GeV emission that only presents during the source's hard state. We show that XRB coronae could contribute significantly to the Galactic cosmic-ray and Galactic plane neutrino fluxes. Our model predicts variable high-energy neutrino emission from bright Galactic XRBs that may be observed by IceCube and future neutrino observatories.</description>

      <title>The non-thermal emission following GW170817 is consistent with a conical radially-stratified outflow with initial Lorentz factor $\lesssim10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the non-thermal radio to X-ray emission following the neutron star merger GW\,170817 is consistent with synchrotron emission from a collisionless shock driven into the interstellar medium (ISM) by a conical radially stratified outflow observed $\approx0.25$~rad off-axis, with a power-low mass dependence on momentum, $M(&gt;\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-5}$, maximum Lorenz factor $\gamma\approx10$, opening (half-)angle $\approx0.2$~rad, and total energy of $\approx10^{51}$erg. The temporal dependence of the flux during its rising phase is determined by the radial stratification structure, which determines the rate at which outflow energy is deposited in the ISM. This is in contrast with highly relativistic, $\gamma\approx100$, structured jet models, where the angular jet structure determines the time dependence through the gradual "unveiling" by deceleration of larger angular sections of the jet (which are initially "hidden" by relativistic beaming), typically leading to a predicted flux decline after the peak that is faster than observed. Our model predicts a dependence on the observing angle, which is different than that predicted by highly relativistic jet models. Particularly, similar merger events observed closer to the symmetry axis are predicted to show a similarly extended duration of flux increase with time. Our analysis demonstrates that the data do not require a highly relativistic $\gamma\approx100$ component, but the presence of such a component with opening angle $\ll0.2$~rad and energy $\ll10^{51}$~erg cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength and Multi-messenger Counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts are brief, highly dispersed bursts detected in the radio band, originating from cosmological distances. The only such event detected in the Milky Way galaxy, FRB 20200428DD, was associated with an X-ray burst emitted by a magnetar named SGR J1935+2154, revealing the first case of a multi-wavelength counterpart of an FRB. Counterparts in other wavelengths accompanying or following FRBs, as well as the bright emission associated with the progenitor of the FRB engine, have been proposed in various FRB models, but no robust detection has been made so far. In general, FRBs as we know them are not favorite multi-messenger emitters. Nonetheless, possible neutrino and gravitational wave emission signals associated with FRBs or FRB-like events have been discussed in the literature. Here I review these suggested multi-wavelength and multi-messenger counterparts of FRBs or FRB-like events and the observational progress in searching for these signals. The topics include multi-wavelength (X-rays, $\gamma$-rays, optical) emission and neutrino emission from FRBs within the framework of the magnetar source models and possible FRB-like events associated with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Towards a new generation of reflection models for precision measurements of accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blurred reflection features are commonly observed in the X-ray spectra of accreting black holes. In the presence of high-quality data and with the correct astrophysical model, X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the strong gravity region of black holes, study the morphology of the accreting matter, measure black hole spins, and test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In the past 10-15 years, there has been significant progress in the development of the analysis of these reflection features, thanks to both more sophisticated theoretical models and new observational data. However, the next generation of X-ray missions (e.g. eXTP, Athena, HEX-P) promises to provide unprecedented high-quality data, which will necessarily require more accurate synthetic reflection spectra than those available today. In this talk, I will review the state-of-the-art in reflection modeling and I will present current efforts to develop a new generation of reflection models with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>The Disk Wind Contribution to the Gamma-Ray emission from the nearby Seyfert Galaxy GRS 1734-292</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies have been detected in GeV gamma-rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), but the origin of much of this emission is unclear. We consider the nearby example, the Seyfert galaxy GRS 1734-292, which exhibits weak starburst and jet activities that are insufficient to explain the observed gamma-ray flux. With the first detailed multi-wavelength study of this source, we demonstrate that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk wind can account for its gamma-ray emission. Using a lepto-hadronic emission model based on a shocked ambient medium and a shocked wind region created by an AGN accretion disk wind, we identify two viable scenarios that are consistent with the Fermi-LAT data and multi-wavelength observations: a hadronic pp-dominated scenario and a leptonic external Compton-dominated scenario. Both of these show that future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) could detect TeV emission from a disk wind in GRS 1734-292. Such a detection would substantially improve our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration efficiency in AGN disk wind systems, and would establish radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies as cosmic ray accelerators capable of reaching ultra-high energies.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic fast X-ray transient from a weak relativistic jet associated with a Type Ic-BL supernova</title>

Abstract: Massive stars end their life as core-collapse supernovae, amongst which some extremes are Type Ic broad-lined supernovae associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) having powerful relativistic jets. Their less-extreme brethren make unsuccessful jets that are choked inside the stars, appearing as X-ray flashes or low-luminosity GRBs. On the other hand, there exists a population of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) with timescales ranging from seconds to thousands of seconds, whose origins remain obscure. Known sources that contribute to the observed EFXT population include the softer analogs of LGRBs, shock breakouts of supernovae, or unsuccessful jets. Here, we report the discovery of the bright X-ray transient EP240414a detected by the Einstein Probe (EP), which is associated with the Type Ic supernova SN 2024gsa at a redshift of 0.401. The X-ray emission evolution is characterised by a very soft energy spectrum peaking at &lt; 1.3 keV, which makes it distinct from known LGRBs, X-ray flashes, or low-luminosity GRBs. Follow-up observations at optical and radio bands revealed the existence of a weak relativistic jet that interacts with an extended shell surrounding the progenitor star. Located on the outskirts of a massive galaxy, this event reveals a new population of explosions of Wolf-Rayet stars characterised by a less powerful engine that drives a successful but weak jet, possibly owing to a progenitor star with a smaller core angular momentum than in traditional LGRB progenitors.</description>

      <title>Long-term Monte Carlo based neutrino-radiation viscous-hydrodynamics simulations for a merger remnant black hole-torus system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our new general relativistic Monte Carlo (MC)-based neutrino radiation hydrodynamics code designed to solve axisymmetric systems with several improvements. The main improvements are as follows: (i) the development of an extended version of the implicit MC method for multi-species radiation fields; (ii) modeling of neutrino pair process rates based on a new numerically efficient and asymptotically correct fitting function for the kernel function; (iii) the implementation of new numerical limiters on the radiation-matter interaction to ensure a stable and physically correct evolution of the system. We apply our code to a black hole (BH)-torus system with a BH mass of $3\,M_\odot$, BH dimmensionless spin of 0.8, and a torus mass of $0.1\,M_\odot$, which mimics a post-merger remnant of a binary neutron star merger in the case that the massive neutron star collapses to a BH within a short time scale ($\sim10\,{\rm ms}$). We follow the evolution of the BH-torus system up to more than $1\,{\rm s}$ with our MC-based radiation viscous-hydrodynamics code that dynamically takes into account non-thermal pair process. We find that the system evolution and the various key quantities, such as neutrino luminosity, ejecta mass, torus $Y_e$, and pair annihilation luminosity, are broadly in agreement with the results of the previous studies. We also find that the $\nu_e{\bar \nu}_e$ pair annihilation can launch a relativistic outflow for a time scale of $\sim 0.1\,{\rm s}$, and it can be energetic enough to explain some of short-hard gamma-ray bursts and the precursors. Finally, we calculate the indicators of the fast flavor instability directly from the obtained neutrino distribution functions, which indicate that the instability can occur particularly near the equatorial region of the torus.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos bend? Consequences of an ultralight gauge field as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18300v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ultralight gauge boson could address the missing cosmic dark matter, with its transverse modes contributing to a relevant component of the galactic halo today. We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and neutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the galactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae could be delayed by $\delta t = \left(10^{-8}-10^1\right)\,$s for the gauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \left(10^{-23}-10^{-19}\right)\,$eV and the coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}-10^{-20}$. While we do not focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark matter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We discuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force experiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos. We consider the concrete case of the DUNE facility, where the coupling can be tested down to $g \simeq 10^{-27}$ for neutrinos coming from a supernova event at a distance $d = 10\,$kpc from Earth.</description>

      <title>Role of neutron pairing with density-gradient dependence in the semi-microscopic treatment of the inner crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the fourth-order extended Thomas-Fermi method with Strutinsky-integral shell and pairing corrections, we calculate the inner crust of neutron stars with the BSk31 functional, whose pairing has two terms: i) a term that is fitted to the results of microscopic calculations on homogeneous nuclear matter (accounting for both medium polarization and self-energy effects) that are more realistic than those of our earlier functionals; ii) an empirical term that is dependent on the density gradient, which permits an excellent fit to nuclear masses. Both proton and neutron pairing are taken into account, the former in the BCS theory and the latter in the local density approximation. We found that the equilibrium value of the proton number $Z$ remains 40 over the entire density range considered, whether or not neutron pairing is included. The new equation of state and the composition are very similar to those of our previously preferred functional, BSk24. However, the predicted neutron pairing fields are quite different. In particular, clusters are found to be impermeable to the neutron superfluid. The implications for the neutron superfluid dynamics are briefly discussed. Since the new pairing is more realistic, the functional BSk31 is better suited for investigating neutron superfluidity in neutron-star crusts.</description>

      <title>Study of magnetic reconnection at low-$\beta$ using laser-powered capacitor coils</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that rapidly converts magnetic energy into some combination of flow energy, thermal energy, and non-thermal energetic particles. Over the past decade, a new experimental platform has been developed to study magnetic reconnection using strong coil currents powered by high power lasers at low plasma beta, typical conditions under which reconnection is energetically important in astrophysics. KJ-class lasers were used to drive parallel currents to reconnect MG-level magnetic fields in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry, similar to the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment or MRX, and thus this platform is named micro-MRX. This presentation summarizes two major findings from micro-MRX: direct measurement of accelerated electrons and observation of ion acoustic waves during anti-parallel reconnection. The angular dependence of the measured electron energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that direct acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work. Furthermore, a sudden onset of ion acoustic bursts has been measured by collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of magnetic reconnection, followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk acceleration. These results demonstrate that the micro-MRX platform offers a novel and unique approach to study magnetic reconnection in the laboratory in addition to the capabilities provided by traditional magnetized plasma experiments such as MRX and the upcoming FLARE (Facility for Laboratory Reconnection experiments). Future approaches to study other particle acceleration mechanisms and ion acoustic waves from magnetic reconnection are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Formation of Stripped Stars From Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are an important way to probe the properties of stellar populations surrounding supermassive black holes. Observed spectra of several TDEs, such as ASASSN-14li, show high nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios, leading to questions about their progenitors. Disrupting an intermediate- or high-mass star that has undergone CNO processing, increasing the nitrogen in its core, could lead to an enhanced nitrogen TDE. Galactic nuclei present a conducive environment for high-velocity stellar collisions that can lead to high mass loss, stripping the carbon- and hydrogen-rich envelopes of the stars and leaving behind the enhanced nitrogen cores. TDEs of these stripped stars may therefore exhibit even more extreme nitrogen enhancement. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code StarSmasher, we provide a parameter space study of high-velocity stellar collisions involving intermediate-mass stars, analyzing the composition of the collision products. We conclude that high-velocity stellar collisions can form products that have abundance ratios similar to those observed in the motivating TDEs. Furthermore, we show that stars that have not experienced high CNO processing can yield low-mass collision products that retain even higher nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios. We analytically estimate the mass fallback for a typical TDE of several collision products to demonstrate consistency between our models and TDE observations. Lastly, we discuss how the extended collision products, with high central to average density ratios, can be related to repeated partial TDEs like ASASSN-14ko and G objects in the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>The calibrations of DAMPE $\gamma$-ray effective area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a cosmic-ray detector as well as a pair-converting $\gamma$-ray telescope. The effective area, reflecting the geometrical cross-section area, the $\gamma$-ray conversion probability and the photon selection efficiency, is important in the $\gamma$-ray analyses. In the work, we find a significant time variation in the effective area, as large as $\sim -4\%/{\rm yr}$ at 2 GeV for the high-energy trigger. We derive the data-based correction factors to the effective areas and apply corrections to both the effective areas and the exposure maps. The calibrated exposure can be $\sim 12\%$ smaller than the Monte Carlo one on average at 2 GeV. The calibration is further verified using the observation of the Vela pulsar, showing the spectral parameters with the correction are more consistent with those in the Fermi-LAT catalog than the ones without correction. All the corrections are now implemented in the latest version of the DAMPE $\gamma$-ray analysis toolkit DmpST.</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution and axion-like particles: new constraints and hints from globular clusters in the GAIA DR3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical pseudoscalar bosons, natural in extensions of the Standard Model. Their interactions with ordinary matter and radiation are suppressed, making it challenging to detect them in laboratory experiments. However, these particles, produced within stellar interiors, can provide an additional mechanism for energy loss, potentially influencing stellar evolution. Prominent methods for searching for such effects involve measuring the properties of red giants and helium-burning stars in globular clusters (GCs). Here we use published catalogs of stars selected as members of seven GCs on the basis of parallaxes and proper motions measured by Gaia (Data Realease 3). Making use of previously derived theoretical relations and the new data, we find the upper limit on the ALP-electron coupling, g_{ae}&lt;2.3 10^{-14} (95\% CL), and an indication (3.5 \sigma) to nonzero ALP-photon coupling, g_{a\gamma}=(6.5 +1.0 -1.2) 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}. Given the precision of contemporary observational data, it is imperative to refine ALP constraints through more sophisticated analyses, which will be explored in detail elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.</description>

      <title>Rare Occasions: Tidal Disruption Events Rarely Power the AGNs Observed in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) could be an important growth channel for massive black holes in dwarf galaxies. Theoretical work suggests that the observed active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies are predominantly TDE-powered. To assess this claim, we perform variability analyses on the dwarf-hosted AGNs detected in the $7$ Ms Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) survey, with observations spanning $\approx 16$ years. Based on the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling with X-CIGALE, we select AGNs hosted by dwarf galaxies (stellar mass below $10^{10}\ M_\odot$). We focus on X-ray sources with full-band detections, leading to a sample of $78$ AGNs (0.122 $\leq$ $z$ $\leq$ 3.515). We fit the X-ray light curves with a canonical TDE model of $t^{-5/3}$ and a constant model. If the former outperforms the latter in fitting quality for a source, we consider the source as a potential TDE. We identify five potential TDEs, constituting a small fraction of our sample. Using true- and false-positive rates obtained from fitting models to simulated light curves, we perform Bayesian analysis to obtain the posterior of the TDE fraction for our sample. The posterior peaks close to zero ($2.56\%$), and we obtain a $2$-$\sigma$ upper limit of $9.80\%$. Therefore, our result indicates that the observed AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not predominantly powered by TDEs.</description>

      <title>A Tetrad-First Approach to Robust Numerical Algorithms in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativistic Riemann solvers are typically complex, fragile and unwieldy, at least in comparison to their special relativistic counterparts. In this paper, we present a new high-resolution shock-capturing algorithm on curved spacetimes that employs a local coordinate transformation at each inter-cell boundary, transforming all primitive and conservative variables into a locally flat spacetime coordinate basis (i.e., the tetrad basis), generalizing previous approaches developed for relativistic hydrodynamics. This algorithm enables one to employ a purely special relativistic Riemann solver, combined with an appropriate post-hoc flux correction step, irrespective of the geometry of the underlying Lorentzian manifold. We perform a systematic validation of the algorithm using the Gkeyll simulation framework for both general relativistic electromagnetism and general relativistic hydrodynamics, highlighting the algorithm's superior convergence and stability properties in each case when compared against standard analytical solutions for black hole magnetosphere and ultra-relativistic black hole accretion problems. However, as an illustration of the generality and practicality of the algorithm, we also apply it to more astrophysically realistic magnetosphere and fluid accretion problems in the limit of high black hole spin, for which standard general relativistic Riemann solvers are often too unstable to produce useful solutions.</description>

      <title>G321.3-3.9: A new supernova remnant observed with multi-band radio data and in the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G321.3-3.9 was first identified as a partial shell at radio frequencies a few decades ago. Although it continued to be observed, no additional studies were undertaken until recently. In this paper we present results from a large selection of radio and X-ray data that cover the position of G321.3-3.9. We confirmed G321.3-3.9 as a new supernova remnant (SNR) using data collected by several radio surveys, spanning a frequency range from 200 to 2300 MHz. Stacked eROSITA data from four consecutive all-sky surveys (eRASS:4) provide spectro-imaging information in the energy band 0.2 - 8.0 keV. G321.3-3.9 has an elliptical shape with major and minor axes of approximately 1.7 deg x 1.1 deg. From CHIPASS and S-PASS data, we calculate a spectral index {\alpha} = -0.8 +- 0.2, consistent with synchrotron emission from an expanding shell in the radiative phase. The eROSITA data show an X-ray diffuse structure filling almost the entire radio shell. Based on our spectral analysis, we found the temperature to be approximately 0.6 keV and the column absorption density about 10^21 cm^-2. Comparing this absorption density to optical extinction maps, we estimated the distance to fall within the range of (1.0 - 1.7) kpc, considering the 1{\sigma} uncertainty range.</description>

      <title>Element formation in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of kilonovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the details of $r$-process nucleosynthesis in binary neutron star mergers (BNSM) ejecta is key to interpreting kilonova observations and identifying the role of BNSMs in the origin of heavy elements. We present a self-consistent two-dimensional, ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamic evolution of BNSM ejecta with an online nuclear network (NN) up to the days timescale. For the first time, an initial numerical-relativity ejecta profile composed of the dynamical component, spiral-wave and disk winds is evolved including detailed $r$-process reactions and nuclear heating effects. A simple model for the jet energy deposition is also included. Our simulation highlights that the common approach of relating in post-processing the final nucleosynthesis yields to the initial thermodynamic profile of the ejecta can lead to inaccurate predictions. Moreover, we find that neglecting the details of the radiation-hydrodynamic evolution of the ejecta in nuclear calculations can introduce deviations up to one order of magnitude in the final abundances of several elements, including very light and second $r$-process peak elements. The presence of a jet affects element production only in the innermost part of the polar ejecta, and it does not alter the global nucleosynthesis results. Overall, our analysis shows that employing an online NN improves the reliability of nucleosynthesis and kilonova light curves predictions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical transition to spontaneous scalarization in neutron stars: The massive scalar field scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze numerically the dynamical transition to spontaneous scalarization in neutron stars in the framework of a scalar-tensor theory of gravity where the scalar field is free but massive, and it is coupled nonminimally to gravity in the Jordan frame. We show that the quasistatic configuration of the star that settles after the transition can avoid the observational constraints imposed on the amount of scalarization by several observations in binary systems due to the presence of the mass term, which suppresses the range of the scalar field. We also study the impact of the scalar field mass on the total mass of the star relative to the massless scenario.</description>

      <title>Axion signals from neutron star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a powerful probe of axion dark matter, especially in higher frequency ranges where there remain fewer laboratory constraints. Populations of neutron stars near the Galactic Centre have been proposed as a means to place strong constraints on axion dark matter. One downside of this approach is that there are very few direct observations of neutron stars in this region, introducing uncertainties in the total number of neutron stars in this ``invisible" population at the Galactic Centre, whose size must be inferred through birth rate modelling. We suggest this number could also be reduced due to stellar dynamics carrying stars away from the Galactic Centre via large kick velocities at birth. We attempt to circumvent the uncertainty on the Galactic Centre population size by modelling the axion signal from better understood populations outside the Galactic Centre using {\tt PsrPopPy} which is normalised against pulsar observations. We consider lower-frequency, wider-angle searches for this signal via a range of instruments including MeerKAT and SKA-low but find that the sensitivity is not competitive with existing constraints. Finally, returning to the Galactic Centre, we compare populations to single objects as targets for axion detection. Using the latest modelling of axion-photon conversion in the Galactic Centre magnetar, we conclude that within astrophysical uncertainties, the Galactic Centre population and the magnetar could give comparable sensitivities to axion dark matter, suggesting one should continue to search for both signals in future surveys.</description>

      <title>Simulating Radio Synchrotron Morphology, Spectra, and Polarization of Cosmic Ray Driven Galactic Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of galaxies is significantly influenced by galactic winds, possibly driven by cosmic rays due to their long cooling times and better coupling to plasma compared to radiation. In this study, we compare the radio observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4217 from the CHANG-ES collaboration catalog with a mock observation of an isolated galaxy based on the arepo simulation that adopts the state-of-the-art two-moment cosmic ray transport treatment and multiphase interstellar medium model. We find significant agreement between the simulated and observed images and spectroscopic data for reasonable model parameters. Specifically, we find that (i) the shape of the intensity profiles depends weakly on the magnitude of the magnetic field, the distance of the simulated galaxy, and the normalization of the CR electron spectrum. The agreement between the mock and actual observations is degenerate with respect to these factors; (ii) the multi-wavelength spectrum above 0.1 GHz is in agreement with the radio observations and its slope is also only weakly sensitive to the magnetic field strength; (iii) the magnetic field direction exhibits X-shaped morphology, often seen in edge-on galaxies, which is consistent with the observations and indicates the presence of a galactic-scale outflow. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating advanced cosmic ray transport models in simulations and provide a deeper understanding of galactic wind dynamics and its impact on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for Helium Reionization Detection with Fast Radio Bursts in the Era of Square Kilometre Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observed dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a good indicator of the amount of ionized material along the propagation paths. In this work, we present a forecast of He II reionization detection using the DM and redshift measurements of FRBs from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Assuming a model of the Universe in which He II reionization occurred at a specific redshift $z_{\rm re}$, we analyze what extent the signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{S/N}$) for the detection of the amplitude of reionization can be achieved in the era of SKA. Using $10^{6}$ mock FRB data from a one-year observation of the second phase of SKA, we find that the $\mathrm{S/N}$ for detecting He II reionization can approach the $32-50\sigma$ level and the uncertainty on the reionization redshift can be constrained to be $\sigma(z_{\rm re})\approx 0.022-0.031$, depending on the assumed FRB redshift distribution. This is the first quantitative analysis on the detection significance of He II reionization in the SKA era. We also examine the influence of different fiducial $z_{\rm re}$ values, finding that this effect has a modest impact on the forecasts. Our results demonstrate the potentially remarkable capability of SKA-era FRBs in constraining the epoch of He II reionization.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter and hadronic matter on $f$-mode oscillation of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the possible presence of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars (NSs) and the structural properties of the DM admixed NSs (DMANSs) in one of our recent works \cite{Guha:2024pnn}. The feeble interaction between the fermionic DM ($\chi$) with the hadronic matter is introduced through a dark scalar ($\phi$) and a dark vector ($\xi$) boson as mediators. The allowed range of the mass of the fermionic DM ($m_{\chi}$), for a particular range of DM Fermi momentum ($k_F^{\chi}$), was obtained in the same work \cite{Guha:2024pnn} with respect to the various astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability. The present work is dedicated to the calculation and study of non-radial oscillation of the DMANSs using Cowling approximation. We particularly investigate the effect of presence of DM on the fundamental ($f$) mode oscillation frequencies of the DMANSs utilizing the previously obtained range of $m_{\chi}$ for four different hadronic models. In this work we thoroughly investigate how the individual and combined effects of $m_{\chi}$ and $k_F^{\chi}$ affect the $f$-mode oscillation frequency. Within the framework of our DMANS models, for a particular value of $k_F^{\chi}$, the range of $f_{max}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the allowed range of $m_{\chi}$, is also obtained in the present work for four different hadronic models. Since in the present era, the 1.4 and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ NSs are of special interest after the detection of GW170817 and PSR J0740+6620, we particularly investigate, for the four hadronic models, the range of $f_{1.4}^{DMANS}$ and $f_{2.01}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the acceptable range of $m_{\chi}$ corresponding to the range of $k_F^{\chi}$.</description>
