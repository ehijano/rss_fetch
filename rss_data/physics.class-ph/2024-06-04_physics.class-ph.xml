      <title>Rocket motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of rockets is part of the study devoted to the motion of variable mass systems. Notably those in which the mass leaves permanently the considered system. Rockets are propelled forward by the reaction force produced by the hot exhausted gases ejected from their tales in the rearward direction. Thus their motion should not violate Newton's third principle of the equality of action and reaction forces during the exhaustion process. Nor should it violate Newton's second law of motion judged by inertial observers. However a close examination of the study of the motion of rockets in a major part of physics textbooks, if not all reveals erroneous determination of the expression of the thrust force that pushes the rocket in the forward direction. The false expression of the thrust force entails a bad effect on obtaining the right differential equation that governs the motion of rockets. This trap induced some prominent physics authors to pretend the in applicability of Newton's second law in such particular cases. Not only that, but they also modified Newton's second law in order to fit their purposes of obtaining the right differential equation, historically known under the name Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. The object of this paper is to give the true expression of the thrust force and to write the differential equation of motion of rockets without any necessity of modification of the classical laws. The paper also delves into the expression of the change of velocity of rockets, and proves that their motion is uniformly accelerated in the early stages of liftoff from the ground at condition of constant velocity of expulsion of hot gases from their nozzles.</description>

      <title>Physical interpretations of infinite symmetries and the establishment of unified hierarchies in supersymmetric, ren-symmetric, and classical integrable systems</title>

Abstract: The quest to elucidate potential physical interpretations of infinitely many symmetries and conservation laws inherent in integrable systems constitutes a longstanding challenge within the scientific communities of physics and mathematics. This letter delves into this unresolved issue through an unconventional lens. For a integrable system, there exist various categories of n-wave solutions, such as the n-soliton, multiple breathers, complexitons, and the n-periodic wave solutions, wherein n denotes an arbitrary integer that can approach infinity. Each subwave comprising the n-wave solution may possess certain free parameters, including center parameters, width parameters, and periodic parameters. It is evident that these solutions are invariant with respect to all free parameters. We postulate that the entirety of the recognized infinitely many symmetries merely constitute linear combinations of these finite wave parameter translation symmetries. This conjecture appears to hold true for all integrable systems with n-wave solutions. By considering the KdV equation and the Burgers equation as exemplar cases, the conjecture is substantiated for the n-soliton solutions. It is unequivocal that any linear combination of the wave parameter translation symmetries retains its status as a symmetry associated with the particular solution. This observation suggests that by introducing a ren-variable and a ren-symmetric derivative which serve as generalizations of the Grassmann variable and the super derivatives, it may be feasible to unify classical integrable systems, supersymmetric integrable systems, and ren-symmetric integrable systems within a cohesive hierarchical framework. Notably, a ren-symmetric integrable Burgers hierarchy is explicitly derived. Both the supersymmetric and the classical integrable hierarchies are encompassed within the ren-symmetric integrable hierarchy.</description>
