      <title>Privacy protection under the exposure of systems' prior information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For systems whose states implicate sensitive information, their privacy is of great concern. While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.</description>

      <title>Retail electricity costs and emissions incentives are misaligned for commercial and industrial power consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.</description>

      <title>Semantic Property Maps for Driving Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a vehicle dynamics model for predictive control in driving applications. Instead of solely using the instantaneous parameters estimated from the vehicle signals, we combine this with cameras and update a probabilistic map with parameter estimates and semantic information using Bayesian moment matching. Key to this approach is the map representation, which is constructed with conjugate priors to the measurement likelihoods and defined in the same path coordinates as the vehicle controller, such that the map can be externalized to provide a local representation of the parameter likelihoods that vary in space. The result is a spatial map of vehicle parameters adapted online to enhance the driving control system. We provide theoretical guarantees on the smoothness of relevant parameter likelihood statistics as a function of space, which is critical for their use in predictive control.</description>

      <title>Tissue Activation Calculation in Dual-lead Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a well-established neurosurgical treatment aiming at symptom alleviation in a range of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Computational models of DBS are widely used to investigate the effects of stimulation on neural tissue, to explore stimulation targets and sweetspots, and ultimately, to aid clinicians in the DBS programming by calculating the stimulation parameters. Commonly, DBS is performed bilaterally, i.e. with one lead in each brain hemisphere, where computational models are solved independently for one lead at a time. This paper treats scenarios where multiple DBS leads are implanted in close proximity to one another, resulting in interacting electrical fields and, therefore, potentially overlapping stimulation spreads. In particular, a global dual-lead model is compared to approximations derived from single-lead approaches in a cohort of twelve multiple sclerosis (MS) tremor patients. It is concluded that simple superposition of volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) underestimates activation, while superposition of electric fields or activating functions leads to overestimation. It is concluded that given close proximity of DBS leads, the VTA cannot be computed individually as stimulation fields exhibit significant and complex interaction. The approach is extended to modeling two obsessive compulsive disorder patients with medially placed leads, where similar VTA discrepancies as in the MS patient cohort are observed.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Digital Twin of Sheet Metal Forming via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Based Koopman Operator with Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.</description>

      <title>Region of Attraction Estimate Learning and Verification for Nonlinear Systems using Neural-Network-based Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the Region of Attraction (RoA) for nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in control theory, with direct implications for stability analysis and safe controller design. Traditional approaches rely on analytically derived Lyapunov functions, which are often conservative and challenging to construct for high-dimensional or highly nonlinear systems. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for learning and verifying RoA estimates for nonlinear systems using neural-network-based Lyapunov functions. Our method employs a composite Lyapunov function that combines a quadratic term with a neural-network-based component, providing both structure and flexibility. We introduce a novel homogeneous loss function for training, which removes the imbalance typically caused by the two non-homogeneous Lyapunov conditions. Together, these two aspects enable efficient training of the Lyapunov candidate. To guarantee the correctness of the learned Lyapunov function, we employ a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to formally verify the stability results. Lastly, we perform a deeper analysis near the origin to overcome numerical artifacts, ensuring strict asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark nonlinear systems, showing that it significantly reduces conservatism compared to traditional Lyapunov methods while maintaining verifiability. This framework bridges the gap between function approximation and stability certification, paving the way for scalable safety analysis in learning-based control and safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Flow-Policy Gradient Learning for Linear Quadratic Regulator Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow $Q$-learning has recently been introduced to integrate learning from expert demonstrations into an actor-critic structure. Central to this innovation is the ``the one-step policy'' network, which is optimized through a $Q$-function that is regularized with the behavioral cloning from expert trajectories, allowing learning more expressive policies using flow-based generative models. In this paper, we studied the convergence property and stabilizablity of the one-step policy during learning for linear quadratic problems under the offline settings. Our theoretical results are based on a new formulation of the one-step policy loss based on the average expected cost, and regularized with the behavioral cloning loss. Such a formulation allows us to tap into existing strong theoretical results from the policy gradient theorem to study the convergence properties of the one-step policy. We verify our theoretical finding with simulation results on a linearized inverted pendulum.</description>

      <title>Prognostics and Health Management in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells: Current Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management is crucial for the reliability and lifetime assessment of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs). Here, we review the current advances on this topic, focusing mainly on key degradation mechanisms and methodologies such as physics-aware, data-driven, and hybrid modeling approaches. Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins. Additionally material innovations play a crucial role in bridging existing gaps. This work, therefore, intends to map the further development of Prognostics and Health Management systems toward ensuring the viability of PEFCs in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical Discretization Schemes that Preserve Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential flatness serves as a powerful tool for controlling continuous time nonlinear systems in problems such as motion planning and trajectory tracking. A similar notion, called difference flatness, exists for discrete-time systems. Although many control systems evolve in continuous time, control implementation is performed digitally, requiring discretization. It is well known in the literature that discretization does not necessarily preserve structural properties, and it has been established that, in general, flatness is not preserved under discretization (whether exact or approximate). In this paper, inspired by our previous work [1] and based on the notion of discretization maps, we construct numerical schemes that preserve flatness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language data, such as text and speech, have become readily available through social networking services and chat platforms. By leveraging human observations expressed in natural language, this paper addresses the problem of state estimation for physical systems, in which humans act as sensing agents. To this end, we propose a Language-Aided Particle Filter (LAPF), a particle filter framework that structures human observations via natural language processing and incorporates them into the update step of the state estimation. Finally, the LAPF is applied to the water level estimation problem in an irrigation canal and its effectiveness is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Physics-Enhanced Fault Detection in Wastewater Pump Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring wastewater pump stations is essential because they are critical infrastructure. However, monitoring is still often performed manually due to the lack of suitable algorithmic methods and data. This paper introduces a high-fidelity, physics-enhanced simulator of a three-pump wastewater station that captures transient hydro-mechanical dynamics at a one-second resolution. The simulator is fully parameter-driven, adaptable to other wastewater stations, and capable of generating datasets for data-driven analytics. It can also generate balanced faulty datasets when real failures are scarce or confidential. A comparison with high-frequency SCADA data from a municipal station shows strong agreement across key operational metrics. Furthermore, the paper proposes robust statistical and mathematical frameworks for fault detection and isolation, including a nested-model F-test to detect pump degradation or system faults, and a tangent residual approach to distinguish pump faults from system faults using operating-point kinematics. This framework enables what-if studies, facilitates early fault diagnosis based on flow rate and head, and provides actionable insights for condition-based maintenance in wastewater pumping infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based policy optimization often struggles with inaccurate system dynamics models, leading to suboptimal closed-loop performance. This challenge is especially evident in Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies, which rely on the model for real-time trajectory planning and optimization. We introduce a novel policy optimization framework for MPC-based policies combining differentiable optimization with zeroth-order optimization. Our method combines model-based and model-free gradient estimation approaches, achieving faster transient performance compared to fully data-driven approaches while maintaining convergence guarantees, even under model uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a nonlinear control task involving a 12-dimensional quadcopter model.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilization of Continuous-Time LTI Systems from Noisy Input-Output Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to compute stabilizing controllers for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems directly from an input-output trajectory affected by process and measurement noise. The proposed output-feedback design combines (i) an observer of a non-minimal realization of the plant and (ii) a feedback law obtained from a linear matrix inequality (LMI) that depends solely on the available data. Under a suitable interval excitation condition and knowledge of a noise energy bound, the feasibility of the LMI is shown to be necessary and sufficient for stabilizing all non-minimal realizations consistent with the data. We further provide a condition for the feasibility of the LMI related to the signal-to-noise ratio, guidelines to compute the noise energy bound, and numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous CACC Coexistence: Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithms for vehicle platooning has been extensively investigated, leading to a wide range of approaches with different requirements and performance. Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.</description>

      <title>Translation-Symmetric Market: Enabling Incentive Compatibility For DER Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual power plants (VPPs) are indispensable for coordinating the rapidly growing portfolios of distributed energy resources (DERs) and enabling them to deliver multiple services into higher-level electricity markets. However, the profit allocation procedures that govern VPP participants become increasingly challenging to keep incentive-compatible due to the enlarged DER market power within each VPP, compared to directly bidding into the wholesale market. In this paper, we formulate both the VPP's market participation and its internal operation and profit allocation as consistent market-clearing processes. Building on this unified view, we propose the concept of a translation-symmetric market (TSM) framework, in which market-clearing models maintain identical structural forms across all hierarchical levels. We prove that translation symmetry induces an inductive property: once incentive compatibility holds at one level, it propagates downward to the internal settlements between the VPP and its constituent DERs. TSM also preserves service prices across levels, ensuring competitive conditions and enabling transparent valuation of resource contributions. Theoretical analysis and case studies illustrate how TSM secures incentive-compatible profit allocation in aggregating DERs to provide multiple services.</description>

      <title>Who Moved My Distribution? Conformal Prediction for Interactive Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty-aware prediction is essential for safe motion planning, especially when using learned models to forecast the behavior of surrounding agents. Conformal prediction is a statistical tool often used to produce uncertainty-aware prediction regions for machine learning models. Most existing frameworks utilizing conformal prediction-based uncertainty predictions assume that the surrounding agents are non-interactive. This is because in closed-loop, as uncertainty-aware agents change their behavior to account for prediction uncertainty, the surrounding agents respond to this change, leading to a distribution shift which we call endogenous distribution shift. To address this challenge, we introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that systematically adapts the uncertainty-aware ego-agent controller to the endogenous distribution shift. The proposed method provides probabilistic safety guarantees while adapting to the evolving behavior of reactive, non-ego agents. We establish a model for the endogenous distribution shift and provide the conditions for the iterative conformal prediction pipeline to converge under such a distribution shift. We validate our framework in simulation for 2- and 3- agent interaction scenarios, demonstrating collision avoidance without resulting in overly conservative behavior and an overall improvement in success rates of up to 9.6% compared to other conformal prediction-based baselines.</description>

      <title>WetExplorer: Automating Wetland Greenhouse-Gas Surveys with an Autonomous Mobile Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying greenhouse-gases (GHG) in wetlands is critical for climate modeling and restoration assessment, yet manual sampling is labor-intensive, and time demanding. We present WetExplorer, an autonomous tracked robot that automates the full GHG-sampling workflow. The robot system integrates low-ground-pressure locomotion, centimeter-accurate lift placement, dual-RTK sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance planning, and deep-learning perception in a containerized ROS2 stack. Outdoor trials verified that the sensor-fusion stack maintains a mean localization error of 1.71 cm, the vision module estimates object pose with 7 mm translational and 3{\deg} rotational accuracy, while indoor trials demonstrated that the full motion-planning pipeline positions the sampling chamber within a global tolerance of 70 mm while avoiding obstacles, all without human intervention. By eliminating the manual bottleneck, WetExplorer enables high-frequency, multi-site GHG measurements and opens the door for dense, long-duration datasets in saturated wetland terrain.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Control of Sustainable Transitions through Opinion-Behavior Coupling in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how sustainable behaviors spread within heterogeneous societies requires the integration of behavioral data, social influence mechanisms, and structured approaches to control. In this paper, we propose a data-driven computational framework for coupled opinion-adoption dynamics in social systems. Each node in the multilayer network represents a community characterized by a specific age group and mobility level, derived from large-scale survey data on the predisposition to adopt electric vehicles in Northern Europe. The proposed model captures three mechanisms: behavioral contagion through social and informational diffusion, abandonment driven by dissatisfaction, and feedback between opinions and adoption levels through social influence. Analyzing the equilibrium points of the coupled system allows us to derive the conditions that enable large-scale adoption. We empirically calibrate the model using data to construct synthetic populations and social similarity networks, which we use to explore targeted interventions that promote sustainable transitions. Specifically, the analysis focuses on two types of control strategies: opinion-based policies, which act on the social network layer, and policies that aim to improve experience and reduce dissatisfaction. Simulation results show that the latter ensure more stable and long-term adoption, offering concrete insights for designing effective interventions in sociotechnical transitions toward sustainability.</description>

      <title>Simulating an Autonomous System in CARLA using ROS 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing offers a rigorous setting to stress test perception, planning, and control under high speed and uncertainty. This paper proposes an approach to design and evaluate a software stack for an autonomous race car in CARLA: Car Learning to Act simulator, targeting competitive driving performance in the Formula Student UK Driverless (FS-AI) 2025 competition. By utilizing a 360{\deg} light detection and ranging (LiDAR), stereo camera, global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor via ROS 2 (Robot Operating System), the system reliably detects the cones marking the track boundaries at distances of up to 35 m. Optimized trajectories are computed considering vehicle dynamics and simulated environmental factors such as visibility and lighting to navigate the track efficiently. The complete autonomous stack is implemented in ROS 2 and validated extensively in CARLA on a dedicated vehicle (ADS-DV) before being ported to the actual hardware, which includes the Jetson AGX Orin 64GB, ZED2i Stereo Camera, Robosense Helios 16P LiDAR, and CHCNAV Inertial Navigation System (INS).</description>

      <title>Multistability of Self-Attention Dynamics in Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.</description>

      <title>Parking of Connected Automated Vehicles: Vehicle Control, Parking Assignment, and Multi-agent Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to optimize parking efficiency for connected and Automated vehicle (CAVs) fleets. We present a multi-vehicle parking simulator, equipped with hierarchical path planning and collision avoidance capabilities for individual CAVs. The simulator is designed to capture the key decision-making processes in parking, from low-level vehicle control to high-level parking assignment, and it enables the effective assessment of parking strategies for large fleets of ground vehicles. We formulate and compare different strategic parking spot assignments to minimize a collective cost. While the proposed framework is designed to optimize various objective functions, we choose the total parking time for the experiment, as it directly reflects the congestion level and the cost associated with the parking efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies through an empirical evaluation against a dataset of real-world parking lot dynamics, realizing a substantial reduction in parking time by up to 43.8%. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic benefits of driving automation, the utilization of shared infrastructure state data, the exclusion of pedestrian traffic, and the real-time computation of optimal parking spot allocation.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control with Automated Mirror Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20165v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an interpolation-based framework for noisy linear systems with unknown system matrix with bounded norm (implying bounded growth or non-increasing energy), and bounded process noise energy. The proposed approach characterizes all trajectories consistent with the measured data and these prior bounds in a purely data-driven manner. This characterization enables data-consistency verification, inference, and one-step ahead prediction, which can be leveraged for safety verification and cost minimization. Ultimately, this work represents a preliminary step toward exploiting interpolation conditions in data-driven control, offering a systematic way to characterize trajectories consistent with a dynamical system within a given class and enabling their use in control design.</description>

      <title>Max-Min Fairness in Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Aided Rate Splitting Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a downlink multiuser multiple-input single-output system that integrates rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to enable wave-domain beamforming. Unlike conventional digital beamforming, the proposed system leverages the programmable phase shifts of the SIM to perform beamforming entirely in the wave domain. In contrast to existing literature, this work introduces a fairness-centric SIM-RSMA design that shifts the emphasis from maximizing sum-rate to ensuring fair allocation of resources. In particular, we formulate a max-min rate optimization problem that jointly optimizes transmit power coefficients at the base station and SIM phase shifts. Given the non-convex nature of this problem, we develop an alternating optimization framework, where the power allocation is optimized through successive convex approximation and SIM beamforming is optimized using the Riemannian conjugate gradient method. Simulation results indicate that combining SIM with RSMA yields superior max-min performance compared to its integration with space division multiple access or non-orthogonal multiple access.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the stabilization problem for force-controlled nonholonomic mobile robots under safety-critical constraints. We propose a continuous, time-invariant control law based on the gamma m-quadratic programming (gamma m-QP) framework, which unifies control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce both stability and safety in the closed-loop system. For the first time, we construct a global, time-invariant, strict Lyapunov function for the closed-loop nonholonomic mobile robot full-dynamic system with a nominal stabilization controller in polar coordinates; this strict Lyapunov function then serves as the CLF in the QP design. Next, by exploiting the inherent cascaded structure of the vehicle dynamics, we develop a CBF for the mobile robot via an integrator backstepping procedure. Our main results guarantee both asymptotic stability and safety for the closed-loop system. Both the simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our approach.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a time-optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems subject to multiplicative uncertainties represented by interval matrices. To render the uncertainty propagation computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two satellites.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prime Farmland: Solar Siting Tradeoffs for Cost-Effective Decarbonization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of continued growth in solar photovoltaics are closely tied to siting decisions. But trade-offs between costs and technical potential between land categories, especially brownfields and rooftop sites, have not been quantified, despite increasing resistance to and policy interest in reducing use of greenfield sites (e.g., prime agricultural lands). We examine the effect of siting decisions across land types for utility-scale and rooftop PV on the feasibility and cost of meeting solar deployment targets across the Eastern U.S. We build a database of solar PV supply curves by land type for each county in the Eastern Interconnect (EI) region (~2,400 counties). Our supply curves quantify technical potential versus levelized cost across greenfield, brownfield, and rooftop land types. With these supply curves and a 2035 solar deployment target (435 GW) aligned with a decarbonized power system, we quantify cost and capacity trade-offs using scenarios that prioritize solar PV deployment on different land types. We find greenfield, particularly prime agriculture, sites offer the lowest levelized costs for meeting capacity targets, of 39 to 57 $/MWh. Contaminated lands, often prioritized in policy to reduce land use conflict, have limited technical potential and impose a cost premium of 14-33% relative to greenfield sites. Rooftop PV provides enough technical potential for meeting capacity targets but comes at consistently higher costs, with minimum LCOEs of roughly 70 $/MWh or well above the highest-cost greenfield sites. Our results detail heterogeneous siting trade-offs across the Eastern United States, enabling targeted policy design to meet deployment targets while balancing costs and land use conflicts.</description>

      <title>When the Correct Model Fails: The Optimality of Stackelberg Equilibria with Follower Intention Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-player dynamic Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower whose intention is unknown to the leader. Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) function is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. We study a setting in which the leader receives updated beliefs about the follower BR before the end of the game, such that the update prompts the leader and subsequently the follower to re-optimize their strategies. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop and feedback information structures. Interestingly, we prove that in general, assuming an incorrect follower's BR can lead to more optimal leader costs over the entire game than knowing the true follower's BR. We support these results with numerical examples in a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game, and use Monte Carlo simulations to show that the instances of incorrect BR achieving lower leader costs are non-trivial in collision avoidance LQ Stackelberg games.</description>

      <title>Strong Duality in Risk-Constrained Nonconvex Functional Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a wide class of risk-constrained nonconvex functional optimization problems exhibit strong duality, regardless of nonconvexity. We develop two novel results under distinct sets of assumptions, establishing strong duality over both decomposable policy spaces (matching and extending prior work in the risk neutral case), and nondecomposable policy spaces with structure (e.g., continuity or smoothness), including certain universal finite-dimensional (fixed depth/width) neural network parametrizations as special cases (improving established results in the risk-neutral setting as well). We consider constraints featuring convex and positively homogeneous risk measures with bounded risk envelopes, generalizing expectations. Popular risk measures supported within our setting include the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), the (even non-monotone) mean-absolute deviation (MAD), certain distributionally robust representations and more generally all real-valued coherent risk measures on the space $L_1$. We further discuss various generalizations of our base model, extensions for risk measures supported on $L_{p&gt;1}$, implications in the context of mean-risk tradeoff models, as well as applications in wireless systems resource allocation, and supervised constrained learning. Our core proof technique appears to be new and relies on risk conjugate duality in tandem with J. J. Uhl's weak extension of A. A. Lyapunov's convexity theorem for vector measures taking values in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>DiAReL: Reinforcement Learning with Disturbance Awareness for Robust Sim2Real Policy Transfer in Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delayed Markov decision processes (DMDPs) fulfill the Markov property by augmenting the state space of agents with a finite time window of recently committed actions. In reliance on these state augmentations, delay-resolved reinforcement learning algorithms train policies to learn optimal interactions with environments featuring observation or action delays. Although such methods can be directly trained on the real robots, due to sample inefficiency, limited resources, or safety constraints, a common approach is to transfer models trained in simulation to the physical robot. However, robotic simulations rely on approximated models of the physical systems, which hinders the sim2real transfer. In this work, we consider various uncertainties in modeling the robot or environment dynamics as unknown intrinsic disturbances applied to the system input. We introduce the disturbance-augmented Markov decision process (DAMDP) in delayed settings as a novel representation to incorporate disturbance estimation in training on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed method is validated across several metrics on learning robotic reaching and pushing tasks and compared with disturbance-unaware baselines. The results show that the disturbance-augmented models can achieve higher stabilization and robustness in the control response, which in turn improves the prospects of successful sim2real transfer.</description>

      <title>EAST: Environment Aware Safe Tracking using Planning and Control Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of autonomous mobile robot navigation in unknown environments with moving obstacles. We propose a new method to achieve environment-aware safe tracking (EAST) of robot motion plans that integrates an obstacle clearance cost for path planning, a convex reachable set for robot motion prediction, and safety constraints for dynamic obstacle avoidance. EAST adapts the motion of the robot according to the locally sensed environment geometry and dynamics, leading to fast motion in wide open areas and cautious behavior in narrow passages or near moving obstacles. Our control design uses a reference governor, a virtual dynamical system that guides the robot's motion and decouples the path tracking and safety objectives. While reference governor methods have been used for safe tracking control in static environments, our key contribution is an extension to dynamic environments using convex optimization with control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Thus, our work establishes a connection between reference governor techniques and CBF techniques for safe control in dynamic environments. We validate our approach in simulated and real-world environments, featuring complex obstacle configurations and natural dynamic obstacle motion.</description>

      <title>Protection Degree and Migration in the Stochastic SIRS Model: A Queueing System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the prevalence of COVID-19, the modeling of epidemic propagation and its analyses have played a significant role in controlling epidemics. However, individual behaviors, in particular the self-protection and migration, which have a strong influence on epidemic propagation, were always neglected in previous studies. In this paper, we mainly propose two models from the individual and population perspectives. In the first individual model, we introduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the epidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative population model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate the individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving population network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are applied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected probability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited distribution are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Evolving Network Modeling Driven by the Degree Increase and Decrease Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ever since the Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) scale-free network has been proposed, network modeling has been studied intensively in light of the network growth and the preferential attachment (PA). However, numerous real systems are featured with a dynamic evolution including network reduction in addition to network growth. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for evolving networks from the perspective of vertex degree. We construct a queueing system to describe the increase and decrease of vertex degree, which drives the network evolution. In our mechanism, the degree increase rate is regarded as a function positively correlated to the degree of a vertex, ensuring the preferential attachment in a new way. Degree distributions are investigated under two expressions of the degree increase rate, one of which manifests a ``long tail'', and another one varies with different values of parameters. In simulations, we compare our theoretical distributions with simulation results and also apply them to real networks, which presents the validity and applicability of our model.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable hydrostatics: Toward versatile and efficient load-bearing robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable and legged robot designers face multiple challenges when choosing actuation. Traditional fully actuated designs using electric motors are multifunctional but oversized and inefficient for bearing conservative loads and for being backdrivable. Alternatively, quasi-passive and underactuated designs reduce the amount of motorization and energy storage, but are often designed for specific tasks. Designers of versatile and stronger wearable robots will face these challenges unless future actuators become very torque-dense, backdrivable and efficient
  This paper explores a design paradigm for addressing this issue: reconfigurable hydrostatics. We show that a hydrostatic actuator can integrate a passive force mechanism and a sharing mechanism in the fluid domain and still be multifunctional. First, an analytical study compares the effect of these two mechanisms on the motorization requirements in the context of a load-bearing exoskeleton. Then, the hydrostatic concept integrating these two mechanisms using hydraulic components is presented. A case study analysis shows the mass/efficiency/inertia benefits of the concept over a fully actuated one. Then, experiments are conducted on robotic legs to demonstrate that the actuator concept can meet the expected performance in terms of force tracking, versatility, and efficiency under controlled conditions. The proof-of-concept can track the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) profiles of walking, running, squatting, and jumping, and the energy consumption is 4.8x lower for walking. The transient force behaviors due to switching from one leg to the other are also analyzed along with some mitigation to improve them.</description>

      <title>Mining--Gym: A Configurable RL Benchmarking Environment for Truck Dispatch Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the mining process -- particularly truck dispatch scheduling -- is a key driver of efficiency in open-pit operations. However, the dynamic and stochastic nature of these environments, with uncertainties such as equipment failures, truck maintenance, and variable haul cycle times, challenges traditional optimization. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows strong potential for adaptive decision-making in mining logistics, practical deployment requires evaluation in realistic, customizable simulation environments. The lack of standardized benchmarking hampers fair algorithm comparison, reproducibility, and real-world applicability of RL solutions.
  To address this, we present Mining-Gym -- a configurable, open-source benchmarking environment for training, testing, and evaluating RL algorithms in mining process optimization. Built on Salabim-based Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and integrated with Gymnasium, Mining-Gym captures mining-specific uncertainties through an event-driven decision-point architecture. It offers a GUI for parameter configuration, data logging, and real-time visualization, supporting reproducible evaluation of RL strategies and heuristic baselines.
  We validate Mining-Gym by comparing classical heuristics with RL-based scheduling across six scenarios from normal operation to severe equipment failures. Results show it is an effective, reproducible testbed, enabling fair evaluation of adaptive decision-making and demonstrating the strong performance potential of RL-trained schedulers.</description>

      <title>Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work investigates the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs in the context of a two-player finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player, measured or estimated at each stage, affect the state and cost function of the other player. To mitigate these effects, we propose an adjusted control policy that optimally compensates for the deviations under the stated information structure and can, under certain conditions, exploit them to improve performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a representative numerical example.</description>
