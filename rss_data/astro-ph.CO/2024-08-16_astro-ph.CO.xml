      <title>The impact of cosmic variance on PTAs anisotropy searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently found evidence for a Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) by measuring the perturbations that this background induces in the time-of-arrivals of pulsar signals. These perturbations are expected to be correlated across different pulsars and, for isotropic GWBs, the expected values of these correlations (obtained by averaging over different GWB realizations) are a simple function of the pulsars' angular separations, known as the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation function. On the other hand, anisotropic GWBs would induce deviations from these HD correlations in a way that can be used to search for anisotropic distributions of the GWB power. However, even for isotropic GWBs, interference between GW sources radiating at overlapping frequencies induces deviations from the HD correlation pattern, an effect known in the literature as "cosmic variance". In this work, we study the impact of cosmic variance on PTA anisotropy searches. We find that the fluctuations in cross-correlations related to cosmic variance can lead to the miss-classification of isotropic GWBs as anisotropic, leading to a false detection rate of $\sim 50\%$ for frequentist anisotropy searches. We also observe that cosmic variance complicates the reconstruction of the GWB sky map, making it more challenging to resolve bright GW hotspots, like the ones expected to be produced from a Supermassive Black Hole Binaries population. These findings highlight the need to refine anisotropy search techniques to improve our ability to reconstruct the GWB sky map and accurately assess the significance of any isotropy deviations we might find in it.</description>

      <title>Probing non-minimal coupling through super-horizon instability and secondary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Particularly for $\xi &gt;1$ such instability causes substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in an intermediate-frequency range that is strong enough to be detected by future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong upper bound on the value of $\xi$ depending upon the value of $\wre$ and reheating temperature $\Tre$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \lesssim 4.0$ for any value of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, reheating equation of state within $ 1/2 \leq\wre \leq 1$, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. However, for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, $\xi$ is found to be unconstrained by any known observation. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Constraining Ultralight ALP Dark Matter in Light of Cosmic Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence, the observed rotation of the polarization plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), serves as a compelling probe for parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. This study explores the potential of ultralight axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter to explain the observed cosmic birefringence in the CMB. We focus on the previously understudied mass range of $10^{-25}$ eV to $10^{-23}$ eV, where ALPs start to undergo nonlinear clustering in the late universe. Our analysis incorporates recent cosmological constraints and considers the washout effect on CMB polarization. We find that for models with ALP masses $10^{-25}$ eV $\lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-23}$ eV and birefringence arising from late ALP clustering, the upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling constant, imposed by the washout effect, is stringently lower than the coupling required to account for the observed static cosmic birefringence signal. This discrepancy persists regardless of the ALP fraction in dark matter. Furthermore, considering ALPs with masses $m_\phi\gtrsim$ $10^{-23}$ eV cannot explain static birefringence due to their rapid field oscillations, our results indicate that, all ALP dark matter candidates capable of nonlinear clustering in the late universe and thus contributing mainly to the rotation angle of polarized photons, are incompatible with explaining the static cosmic birefringence signal observed in Planck and WMAP data.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic equilibrium of X-ray gas in HMG: four representative cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) was originally proposed to model galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. However, MOND presents difficulties in explaining the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) observed in galaxy clusters, and moreover, it does not completely eliminate the need for dark matter, since it requires using sterile neutrinos to explain the observed hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas. Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) offers a relativistic framework that recovers the success of MOND in galaxy rotation curves as a natural particular case, and it could potentially reconcile the above discrepancies without invoking any type of dark matter. This Letter analyses the performance of the HMG model for hydrostatic equilibrium in four representative systems: groups of NGC 533 and NGC 5044 galaxies, and clusters of Abell 2717 and Abell 2029. Specifically, we used high-resolution X-ray data with which gas density, temperature, and mass profiles were previously derived to constrain modified gravity models. Our results show that the hydrostatic equilibrium in the four systems is naturally adjusted to the HMG model without the need for fitting parameters or adding sterile neutrinos, which are required for MOND theories.</description>

      <title>Systematic effects on lensing reconstruction from a patchwork of CMB polarization maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tolerance for systematic errors in lensing analysis applied to a patchwork map of Cosmic Microwave Background polarization. We focus on the properties of the individual polarization maps that comprise the patchwork and discuss the associated calibration residuals that are coherent on those subpatches. We numerically simulate the polarization field modulated as a whole patchwork and apply a suite of lensing analyses to reveal the response of the reconstructed gravitational lensing potential and delensing efficiency. At systematic error levels expected in the near future, we find that it is possible to accurately reconstruct the lensing potential on scales larger than the subpatch size and that there is no severe degradation of the lensing $B$-mode removal efficiency in the subsequent delensing analysis.</description>

      <title>Absence of one-loop effects on large scales from small scales in non-slow-roll dynamics II: Quartic interactions and consistency relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove explicitly the absence of one-loop corrections to large scales from small scales in transient non-slow-roll dynamics. Specifically, we address loop corrections to the primordial power spectrum, relative to tree-level, that are independent of the ratio between the two scales. We review all the necessary components, adapted to our context, to express one-loop diagrams as three-point functions, emphasizing the crucial role played by quartic interactions. Notably, we include the quartic Hamiltonian induced by the cubic Lagrangian and quartic interactions that are ensured by diffeomorphism invariance. We then explicitly prove consistency relations for an arbitrary transient non-slow-roll phase involving operators with (time) derivatives. Finally, we calculate one-loop corrections by including contributions from the relevant cubic and quartic interactions, and express the final result as a total derivative term over comoving momenta, utilizing the consistency relations we established. This leads us to conclude that one-loop corrections to long-wavelength modes are unaffected by the physics of short and enhanced modes in non-slow-roll dynamics.</description>

      <title>Testing galaxy formation models with the stellar mass-halo mass relations for star-forming and quiescent galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tight relationship between the stellar mass and halo mass of galaxies is one of the most fundamental scaling relations in galaxy formation and evolution. It has become a critical constraint for galaxy formation models. Over the past decade, growing evidence has convincingly shown that the stellar mass-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for star-forming and quiescent central galaxies differ significantly: at a given stellar mass, the average host halo mass of quiescent centrals is more massive than that of the star-forming centrals. Despite the importance of this feature, its scientific implications have been largely overlooked and inadequately discussed. In this work, we demonstrate that the semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES successfully reproduces these observational results, whereas three state-of-the-art hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations (TNG, Illustris, and EAGLE) do not. Consequently, in L-GALAXIES, star-forming central galaxies are more efficient at converting baryons into stars than quiescent central galaxies at a given halo mass, while the other models predict similar efficiencies for both populations. Further analysis reveals that these fundamental discrepancies stem from distinct evolutionary paths on the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We show that the observed SHMRs for star-forming and quiescent galaxies support galaxy formation models in which quenching only weakly correlates with halo assembly histories, and in which the stellar mass of star-forming galaxies can increase significantly since cosmic noon. In contrast, models in which quenching strongly prefers to happen in early-formed halos are disfavored. Additionally, we find that galaxy downsizing is present in L-GALAXIES and TNG, but absent in Illustris and EAGLE.</description>

      <title>No Warm Inflation From Sphaleron Heating With a Vanilla Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, the coupling of an axion to non-Abelian gauge fields causes dissipation due to sphaleron heating. This mechanism is ideally suited for realizing warm inflation since it can lead to large thermal friction while preserving the flatness of the potential. We show, however, that requiring standard properties of an axion $-$ in particular a discrete shift symmetry and a potential generated non-perturbatively by instanton effects $-$ excludes the strong regime of warm slow-roll inflation, in which thermal friction dominates. The derivation of this result does not require any phenomenological input. While non-minimal (axion-like) models provide a way out, sphaleron heating with a standard axion is capable of enabling the weak regime of warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Combined search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies for branon dark matter annihilation signatures with the MAGIC telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive brane fluctuations, called branons, behave as weakly interacting massive particles, which is one of the most favored class of candidates to fulfill the role of the dark matter (DM), an elusive kind of matter beyond the Standard Model. We present a multi-target search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies for branon DM annihilation signatures with a total exposure of 354 hours with the ground-based gamma-ray telescope system MAGIC. This search led to the most constraining limits on branon DM in the sub-TeV and multi-TeV DM mass range. Our most stringent limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section (at $95\%$ confidence level) corresponds to $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \simeq 1.9 \times 10^{-24}{\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}} $ at a branon mass of $ \sim 1.5~\text{TeV}$.</description>

      <title>KiDS-1000: Combined halo-model cosmology constraints from galaxy abundance, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model through a joint analysis of galaxy abundance, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing observables with the Kilo-Degree Survey. Our theoretical model combines a flexible conditional stellar mass function, to describe the galaxy-halo connection, with a cosmological N-body simulation-calibrated halo model to describe the non-linear matter field. Our magnitude-limited bright galaxy sample combines 9-band optical-to-near-infrared photometry with an extensive and complete spectroscopic training sample to provide accurate redshift and stellar mass estimates. Our faint galaxy sample provides a background of accurately calibrated lensing measurements. We constrain the structure growth parameter $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3}=0.773^{+0.028}_{-0.030}$, and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.290^{+0.021}_{-0.017}$. The galaxy-halo connection model adopted in the work is shown to be in agreement with previous studies. Our constraints on cosmological parameters are comparable to, and consistent with, joint $3\times2{\mathrm{pt}}$ clustering-lensing analyses that additionally include a cosmic shear observable. This analysis therefore brings attention to the significant constraining power in the often-excluded non-linear scales for galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing observables. By adopting a theoretical model that accounts for non-linear halo bias, halo exclusion, scale-dependent galaxy bias and the impact of baryon feedback, this work demonstrates the potential and a way forward to include non-linear scales in cosmological analyses. Varying the width of the satellite galaxy distribution with an additional parameter yields a strong preference for sub-Poissonian variance, improving the goodness of fit by 0.18 in reduced $\chi^{2}$ value compared to a fixed Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Dipole in the Quaia Sample of Quasars: A Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian analysis of the Quaia sample of 1.3 million quasars as a test of the cosmological principle. This principle postulates that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, forming the basis of prevailing cosmological models. However, recent analyses of quasar samples have found a matter dipole inconsistent with the inferred kinematic dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), representing a tension with the expectations of the cosmological principle. Here, we explore various hypotheses for the distribution of quasars in Quaia, finding that the sample is influenced by selection effects with significant contamination near the galactic plane. After excising these regions, we find significant evidence that the Quaia quasar dipole is consistent with the CMB dipole, both in terms of the expected amplitude and direction. This result is in conflict with recent analyses, lending support to the cosmological principle and the interpretation that the observed dipole is due to our local departure from the Hubble flow.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Parameters of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the accelerated cosmic expansion within the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Model. To constrain the cosmological parameters of this model, we incorporate 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation points, 31 Cosmic Chronometer points, 40 Type Ia Supernovae points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts points, along with the latest Hubble constant measurement (R22). We treat $r_{d}$ as a free parameter to extract $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ using late-time datasets, aiming for optimal fitting values in each model. Treating $r_{d}$ as free improves precision, reduces bias, and enhances dataset compatibility. The obtained values of $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ are compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, showing consistency with previous estimates from Planck and SDSS studies. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) favor the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model having the lowest AIC. Additionally, we conduct $\Delta$AIC and $\Delta$BIC analyses to assess model preference.} Validation using the reduced $\chi_{red}^{2}$ statistic indicates satisfactory fits for the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz model, while recognizing $\Lambda$CDM as the preferred model. Extensions of the analysis warrant further investigation.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on the Epoch of Reionization Using the non-Gaussianity of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel{'}dovich Effect from the South Pole Telescope and {\it Herschel}-SPIRE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results from an analysis aimed at detecting the trispectrum of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel{'}dovich (kSZ) effect by combining data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and {\it Herschel}-SPIRE experiments over a 100 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ field. The SPT observations combine data from the previous and current surveys, namely SPTpol and SPT-3G, to achieve depths of 4.5, 3, and 16 $\mu {\rm K-arcmin}$ in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. For SPIRE, we include data from the 600 and 857 GHz bands. We reconstruct the velocity-induced large-scale correlation of the small-scale kSZ signal with a quadratic estimator that uses two cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps, constructed by optimally combining data from all the frequency bands. We reject the null hypothesis of a zero trispectrum at $10.3\sigma$ level. However, the measured trispectrum contains contributions from both the kSZ and other undesired components, such as CMB lensing and astrophysical foregrounds, with kSZ being sub-dominant. We use the \textsc{Agora} simulations to estimate the expected signal from CMB lensing and astrophysical foregrounds. After accounting for the contributions from CMB lensing and foreground signals, we do not detect an excess kSZ-only trispectrum and use this non-detection to set constraints on reionization. By applying a prior based on observations of the Gunn-Peterson trough, we obtain an upper limit on the duration of reionization of $\Delta z_{\rm re, 50} &lt; 4.5$ (95\% C.L). We find these constraints are fairly robust to foregrounds assumptions. This trispectrum measurement is independent of, but consistent with, {\it Planck}'s optical depth measurement. This result is the first constraint on the epoch of reionization using the non-Gaussian nature of the kSZ signal.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution on the Spectral and Spatial Anisotropy of Nano-Hertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>

Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open question in the field of modern cosmology. The detection of nanohertz (n-Hz) gravitational waves via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the form of individual events and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a promising avenue for studying SMBH evolution across cosmic time, with SGWB signal being the immediately detectable signal with the currently accessible telescope sensitivities. By connecting the galaxy properties in the large scale (Gpc scale) cosmological simulation such as \texttt{MICECAT} with the small scale ($\sim$ Mpc scale) galaxy simulations from \texttt{ROMULUS}, we show that different scenarios of galaxy-SMBH evolution with redshift leads to a frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy in the SGWB signal. The presence of slow evolution of the SMBHs in the Universe leads to a pronounced blue anisotropic spectrum of the SGWB. In contrast, if SMBHs grow faster in the Universe in lighter galaxies, the frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy exhibits a more flattened anisotropic spectrum. This additional aspect of the SGWB signal on top of the monopole SGWB signal, can give insight on how the SMBHs form in the high redshift Universe and its interplay with the galaxy formation from future measurements.</description>

      <title>An empirical consistent redshift bias: A possible direct reproducible observation of Zwicky's TL theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have shown tensions between observations and our current understanding of the Universe. Such observations may include the $H_o$ tension and massive galaxies at high redshifts that are older than what traditional galaxy formation models predicted. Since these observations are based on the redshift as the primary distance indicator, a bias in the redshift may explain these tensions. While the redshift follows an established model, when applied to astronomy it is based on the assumption that the rotational velocity of the Milky Way galaxy relative to the observed galaxies has a negligible effect on the redshift. But given the mysterious nature of the physics of galaxy rotation, that assumption should be tested. The test is done by comparing the redshift of galaxies rotating in the same direction relative to the Milky Way to the redshift of galaxies rotating in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way. The results show that the mean redshift of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way is higher than the mean redshift of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction. Additionally, the redshift difference becomes larger as the redshift gets higher. The consistency of the analysis was verified by comparing data collected by three different telescopes, annotated using four different methods, released by three different research teams, and cover both the Northern and Southern ends of the galactic pole. All datasets are in excellent agreement with each other, showing consistency in the observed redshift bias. Given the "reproducibility crisis" in science, all datasets used in this study are publicly available, and the results can be easily reproduced. The observation could be a first direct empirical reproducible observation for the Zwicky's "tired-light" model.</description>

      <title>On the origin of transient features in cosmological N-Body Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of gravitational clustering at small scales on larger scales by studying mode coupling between virialised halos. We build on the calculation by Peebles (1974) where it was shown that a virialised halo does not contribute any mode coupling terms at small wave numbers $k$. Using a perturbative expansion in wave number, we show that this effect is small and arises from the deviation of halo shapes from spherical and also on tidal interactions between halos. We connect this with the impact of finite mass resolution of cosmological N-Body simulations on the evolution of perturbations at early times. This difference between the expected evolution and the evolution obtained in cosmological N-Body simulations can be quantified using such an estimate. We also explore the impact of a finite shortest scale up to which the desired power spectrum is realised in simulations. Several simulation studies have shown that this effect is small in comparison with the effect of perturbations at large scales on smaller scales. It is nevertheless important to study these effects and develop a general approach for estimating their magnitude. This is especially relevant in the present era of precision cosmology. We provide basic estimates of the magnitude of these effects and their power spectrum dependence. We find that the impact of small scale cutoff in the initial power spectrum and discreteness increases with $(n+3)$, with $n$ being the index of the power spectrum. In general, we recommend that cosmological simulation data should be used only if the scale of non-linearity, defined as the scale where the linearly extrapolated {\it rms} amplitude of fluctuations is unity, is larger than the average inter-particle separation.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their their large-scale environment. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim0.35-10$ mm) single dish; The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the full design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU-funded project. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding design requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, combine novel concepts with lessons learned from past experience. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms. AtLAST will be capable of $3^\circ\,\rm s^{-1}$ scanning and $1^\circ\,\rm s^{-2}$ acceleration, and aims to feature a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m half wavefront error under static deformations, allowing observations up to $\approx 950$~GHz. Crucially, AtLAST will be a sustainable, visionary facility that will allow upgrades for decades to come. While some aspects require further testing, prototyping, and field demonstrations, we estimate that the design will be construction-ready this decade.</description>

      <title>$F(Q)$ gravity with Gauss-Bonnet corrections: from early-time inflation to late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in the $f(Q)$ gravity with a non-metricity scalar $Q$, the curvatures in Einstein's gravity, that is, the Riemann curvature constructed from the standard Levi-Civita connection, could not be excluded or naturally appear. The first observation is that even in $f(Q)$ gravity, the conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor is not described by the covariant derivatives in the non-metricity gravity but that is given by the Levi-Civita connection. The commutator of the covariant derivatives in Einstein's gravity inevitably induces the Riemann curvature. There is no symmetry nor principle which prohibits the Riemann curvature in non-metricity gravity. Based on this observation, we propose and investigate $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant $\mathcal{G}$ and its generalisations. We show how $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ models realising any given the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime can be reconstructed. We apply the reconstruction formalism to cosmology. Explicitly, the gravity models which realise slow roll or constant roll inflation, dark energy epoch as well as the unification of the inflation and dark energy are found. The dynamical autonomous system and the gravitational wave in the theory under investigation are discussed. It is found the condition that the de Sitter spacetime becomes the (stable) fixed point of the system.</description>

      <title>Galactic Rotation Curves of LSB Galaxies using core-halo FDM configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct galactic halos in order to fit the rotation curves (RCs) of a sample of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. These halos are made of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) with a multimode expansion of non-spherical modes that in average contribute to the appropriate density profile consisting of a core and an envelope needed to fit the rotation curves. The coefficients of the expansion are calculated using a genetic algorithm, that minimizes the difference between the spatial average density of the multimode order parameter describing the FDM and the target dark matter density that fits the RCs. The FDM halos are constructed assuming a solitonic core at the center and two types of envelopes, Navarro-Frenk-White and Pseudo-Isothermal density profiles. The resulting FDM configurations are then evolved in order to show how the average density changes in time due to the secular dynamical evolution, along with a condensation process that lead to the growth of the solitonic core.</description>

      <title>Resonant conversion of axion dark radiation into terahertz electromagnetic radiation in a neutron star magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the strong magnetic field of a neutron star's magnetosphere, axions coupled to electromagnetism develop a nonzero probability to convert into photons. Past studies have revealed that the axion-photon conversion can be resonantly enhanced. We recognize that the axion-photon resonance admits two parametrically distinct resonant solutions, which we call the mass-matched resonance and the Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance. The mass-matched resonance occurs at a point in the magnetosphere where the radially-varying plasma frequency crosses the axion mass $\omega_\mathrm{pl} \approx m_a$. The Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance occurs where the axion energy satisfies $\omega \approx (2 \omega_\mathrm{pl}^2 / 7 g_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma} \bar{B}^2 )^{1/2}$. This second resonance is made possible though the strong background magnetic field $\bar{B}$ as well as the nonzero Euler-Heisenberg four-photon self interaction, which has the coupling $g_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma} = 8 \alpha^2 / 45 m_e^4$. We study the resonant conversion of relativistic axion dark radiation into photons via the Euler-Heisenberg assisted resonance, and we calculate the expected electromagnetic radiation assuming different values for the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ and different amplitudes for the axion flux onto the neutron star $\Phi_a$. We briefly discuss several possible sources of axion dark radiation. Achieving a sufficiently strong axion flux to induce a detectable electromagnetic signal seems unlikely.</description>
