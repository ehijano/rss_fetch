      <title>Evolution With(out) Time: Relational Holography &amp; BPS Complexity Growth in $\mathcal{N}=2$ Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do we describe non-trivial bulk measurements relative to an observer (i.e. relationally) when both the observer and the system it probes may/may not evolve in time? How can we interpret this holographically; particularly for zero-energy BPS states in supersymmetric theories? We address these questions, in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ double-scaled SYK model and its putative bulk dual by: (i) formulating a holographic procedure in the language of quantum reference frames to gravitationally dress bulk observables to ``clocks'' parametrized by both boundary time and R-charge; and (ii) proposing a \emph{new measure of Krylov complexity} with R-charge in the boundary theory that probes zero-energy BPS states. Holographically, this proposal reproduces a relational bulk observable, a BPS wormhole length. We contrast this to the Krylov complexity for Hartle-Hawking states with non-trivial time flow. The latter reproduces the same observable as for the bosonic DSSYK in the semiclassical limit, while its quantum fluctuations can capture supersymmetric corrections.</description>

      <title>Sequestered Conformal Anomaly Mediation (SCAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models in singular extra dimensional spaces feature prominently in many interesting phenomenological models, including those derived from string theory. In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy theory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions, and highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working solely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly mediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra dimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have been performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature by constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying supersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal Anomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from the 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials, the radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the requirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and demonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the na{\i}ve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily broken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry breaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but need to be included as matching corrections. We comment on the potential implications of our methods for phenomenology and singular higher-dimensional constructions, such as the KKLT scenario.</description>

      <title>4D de Sitter from 6D gauged supergravity with Green-Schwarz counterterm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking into account the Green-Schwarz anomaly counterterm in R-symmetry gauged $N=(1,0)$ supergravity in six dimensions, and the associated modification in the Maxwell kinetic term and potential, we observe that the theory admits half-supersymmetric Minkowski$_4\times S^2$ and non-supersymmetric dS$_4 \times S^2$ as exact solutions with a monopole on $S^2$. The monopole charge and the anomaly coefficients play key roles in the vacuum structure and it turns out that a diagonal gauging in which an admixture of an external $U(1)$ with the R-symmetry $U(1)_R$ is needed for the de Sitter solutions to exist. We determine the full Kaluza-Klein spectrum for both vacua. The spectrum is unitary in the Minkowski case but in the case of de Sitter vacuum, two scalars violate the Higuchi unitarity bound, and they represent two tachyonic states, one from the dilaton and the other from the volume of the internal space. We show that turning on small perturbations of the tachyonic modes around the dS$_4\times S^2$ triggers a flow evolving towards Mink$_4\times S^2$ with the minimal potential energy. We also find a nonsupersymmetric AdS$_4\times S^2$ solution, when we turn on a flux associated with external $U(1)$ gauge field only, and show that the phenomenon of scale separation is realized.</description>

      <title>Non-conformally Einstein instantons in Conformal Gravity with and without nonlinear matter fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study non-conformally Einstein gravitational instantons in four-dimensional Conformal Gravity, both in vacuum and in the presence of nonlinear conformal matter. First, the one-parameter extension of the Kerr-NUT-AdS metric is analyzed. We obtain their conserved charges by using the Noether-Wald formalism. It turns out that they receive corrections from the linear modes present in Conformal Gravity, which are properly identified. Then, we perform the analytic continuation into the Euclidean section and find the curve in parameter space along which this solution becomes regular and globally (anti)-self-dual. Using the Dunajski-Tod theorem, we show that the metric is not conformally Einstein. Then, the backreaction of nonlinear conformal matter is considered. In particular, we find new gravitational instantons in the presence of conformally coupled scalar fields and ModMax electrodynamics. We compute the partition function and conserved charges, which turn out to be finite by virtue of the conformal invariance of the theory. As a byproduct, we also obtain a generalization of the Riegert metric dressed with nonlinear conformal matter as a particular limit of these instantons. For all cases, we analyze the global properties, the curve in parameter space where the solutions are (anti)-self-dual, and the on-shell Euclidean action, among other features.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Correlation Functions in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate Euclidean correlation functions through next-to-leading order in the low energy effective theory of gravity. We focus on correlation functions of curvature and volume operators, calculating these functions through one-loop order. We show that quantum fluctuations of the background spacetime must be taken into account in order to obtain gauge invariant expressions, and we point out a subtlety associated with the analytic continuation of the conformal mode. Our final expressions for the correlation functions involve only Newton's constant and the source-sink separation, and they are a universal prediction of the low energy effective theory. Thus, they serve as a useful point of comparison for nonperturbative lattice formulations of gravity.</description>

      <title>Universality of the chiral soliton lattice in the low energy limit of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the chiral soliton lattice (ChSL) is, in a precise sense, a universal feature of the low-energy limit of QCD minimally coupled to Maxwell theory. Here, we disclose that not only can the ChSL be obtained from the gauged Skyrme model in $3+1$ dimensions, including the back-reaction of the Maxwell $U(1)$ gauge field, we also show that the ChSL remains unchanged if the sub-leading corrections to the Skyrme model in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ expansion are included. Taking into account the highly non-linear character of such corrections, this is quite a surprising result. By considering a suitable ansatz adapted to describe topological solitons at finite baryon density in a constant magnetic field, the generalized Skyrme model coupled to the Maxwell theory is reduced to the effective Lagrangian of the ChSL phase, describing a lattice of domain walls made of hadrons. One of the key points in this construction is the fact that even when the usual topological charge density vanishes, the presence of the Callan-Witten term in the topological charge density allows for a non-vanishing baryon number. In the present approach, the magnetic field can be external, as is usually assumed for the ChSL, or it can be self-consistently generated by the hadronic layers themselves. Finally, we show how our formulation allows us to study the coupling of the chiral soliton lattice with quark matter.</description>

      <title>Causal Bounds on EFTs with anomalies with a Pseudoscalar, Photons, and Gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories with pseudoscalars that couple through anomalies (such as axion models) are of particular phenomenological interest. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of all bounds obtainable from bootstrapping the amplitudes when a pseudoscalar couples to photons and gravitons. This allows us to find new cutoff scales of theories with anomalies that are more restrictive than those obtained from naive perturbative analysis. Our results are especially relevant for holographic models, as the bounds determine the allowed region of the five-dimensional EFTs, for example, by imposing strong bounds on Chern-Simons terms. We also consider modifications of General Relativity in photon--graviton couplings and show that current experiments are sensitive to these effects only if new physics appears at $\sim 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Holographic Turbulence and the Fractal Dimension of the Turbulent Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional turbulence driven by a scalar operator within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, where the external driving source is used to sustain a quasi-steady turbulent state. We numerically construct dynamical and spatially inhomogeneous turbulent black holes in the asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_4$ spacetime by solving the full nonlinear equations of motion in the Bondi-Sachs formalism. The inverse energy cascade and the corresponding energy spectrum of both decaying and driven turbulence are analyzed. The scalar driving leads to a compressible energy dominated flow, and the corresponding scaling power laws agree well with previous simulations of two-dimensional turbulence in compressible fluids. Furthermore, we take a direct estimate of the fractal structure of the turbulent black hole, obtaining a fractal dimension $D\approx2.65$, which matches the result from simulating the boundary conformal fluid.</description>

      <title>Classification and Birational Equivalence of Dimer Integrable Systems for Reflexive Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brane tilings are bipartite periodic graphs on the 2-torus and realize a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We present a complete classification of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the 30 brane tilings whose toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds are given by the 16 reflexive polygons in 2 dimensions. For each dimer integrable system associated to a reflexive polygon, we present the Casimirs, the single Hamiltonian built from 1-loops, the spectral curve, and the Poisson commutation relations. We also identify all birational equivalences between dimer integrable systems in this classification by presenting the birational transformations that match the Casimirs and the Hamiltonians as well as the spectral curves and Poisson structures between equivalent dimer integrable systems. In total, we identify 16 pairs of birationally equivalent dimer integrable systems which combined with Seiberg duality between the corresponding brane tilings form 5 distinct equivalence classes. Echoing phenomena observed for brane brick models realizing a family of 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, we illustrate that deformations of brane tilings, including mass deformations, correspond to the birational transformations we discover in this work, and leave invariant the number of generators of the mesonic moduli space as well as the corresponding U(1)R-refined Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>The probe limit in MHD and its implications for magnetic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many phenomenological and effective field-theoretical (EFT) applications of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the presence of a background magnetic field employ a simplifying assumption whereby the electromagnetic and the energy-momentum fluctuations decouple. In studies of magnetic transport, for example in magnetic diffusion, the conservation of energy and momentum is then neglected. In this paper, we investigate the details and the consistency of this so-called $\textit{probe limit}$ in different parametric regimes of MHD plasmas. In the first part of the paper, our discussion explores the hydrodynamic (higher-form) theory of MHD. In the second part, we then explicitly test the probe limit by using a microscopic holographic (AdS/CFT) model of a strongly coupled plasma. In the process, we develop the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh EFT prescription for describing the bulk 2-form fields and their dual 1-form symmetries. Moreover, we find evidence of a phase transition at low temperatures and show that magnetic Hall transport can emerge as a consequence of background charge density that breaks the charge conjugation symmetry of the state. Finally, we discuss the implications for magnetic transport, with a particular view towards the dynamics of dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>de Sitter versus Anti de Sitter flows and the (super)gravity landscape: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic solutions are studied in Einstein-scalar gravity in an ansatz that can interpolate between de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter regimes. The scalar potential is arbitrary. All solutions are determined by their end-points in the scalar field space. All such end-points are classified. This provides a complete classification and characterization of the full space of regular solutions. It is shown that there are no regular (Centaur) solutions that interpolate between an AdS boundary and a dS interior, within our ansatz, when $d&gt;2$. This no-go theorem persists in the presence of multiple scalar fields with a non-trivial field space metric. The Gubser classification of regular solutions is also upgraded to include cases that are not Lorentz invariant and do not contain AdS boundaries.</description>

      <title>Marginally deformed AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ and spindle-like orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, the AdS/CFT correspondence is used as a tool to explore novel AdS$_5$ Supergravity backgrounds (containing five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime) and their dual (four dimensional) Conformal Field Theory descriptions. In order to obtain precise results, both conformal symmetry and supersymmetry play an important role. However, in order to align with experimental observation, supersymmetry must be broken at low energies. In the absence of supersymmetry, finding deformations of a CFT which are marginal in nature (preserving conformal symmetry) is currently not well understood. Nevertheless, the solutions presented in this work may offer the best evidence to date of such deformations.
  Multi-parameter families of non-supersymmetric type IIA and type IIB AdS$_5$ solutions are presented, promoting to $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry in some special cases. Contained within these solutions is an existing class of $\mathcal{N} = 2$ type IIA solutions, recovered in one example when both deformation parameters are fixed to zero. The supersymmetry is studied using the method of G-structures, with the boundaries of the solutions carefully investigated -- uncovering orbifold singularities within some solutions. In the type IIA backgrounds, both the spindle and its higher dimensional analogue play an important role, giving rise to rational quantization of charge. All parameters drop out of a quantity called the holographic central charge, pointing to marginal deformations of the existing $d=4$ $\mathcal{N} = 2$ long linear quiver CFT. These marginal deformations are proposed to correspond to soft-SUSY breaking, with the Lagrangian nature of the CFT broken in some cases.</description>

      <title>Notes on false vacuum decay in quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to gather together some of the basic ideas behind the theory of false vacuum decay in quantum Ising models, focusing on the application of spin chains as analogue systems to false vacuum decay in elementary particle theory. Elementary results on quantum Ising models are rewritten to more closely resemble the original literature on false vacuum decay. A highly speculative conjecture for the false vacuum decay rate in a two dimensional quantum Ising model is also put forward.</description>

      <title>Consistent truncation and generalized duality based on exceptional generalized cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing consistent truncations of supergravity based on exceptional generalized cosets of the form $\GS \backslash G/H$. This approach generalizes the well-established generalized Scherk-Schwarz reductions on generalized parallelizable spaces $G/H$, which preserve maximal supersymmetry, to scenarios with reduced supersymmetry by introducing a non-trivial generalized structure group $\GS$. The double coset structure plays two distinct roles: for a given $G$, the choice of subgroup $\GS$ determines the (constant) generalized torsion/curvature and the pattern of supersymmetry breaking, while $H$ parameterizes inequivalent supergravity backgrounds that share the same truncated theory. The entire construction proceeds algebraically, systematically building $\GS$-invariant tensors from generalized frame fields, with the intrinsic torsion automatically constant and a $\GS$-singlet. Different choices of $H$ lead to distinct higher-dimensional backgrounds that truncate to the same lower-dimensional theory, thereby realizing U-duality. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples in double field theory and exceptional field theory.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the century-old problem of modeling the electron as a pointlike particle with finite self energy, we develop a new class of nonlinear perturbations of Maxwell's electrodynamics inspired by, but distinct from, the Born--Infeld theory. A hallmark of our construction is that the effective radius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a coupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound and consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The models preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically excluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this class of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the non-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the coupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges correctly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A further subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source charge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge arising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the self energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in the strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike structure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically. These findings highlight how nonlinear field equations reconcile theoretical prescription with experimental measurement and suggest a classical rationale for the effective invisibility of the electron substructure.</description>

Abstract: We prove the decomposition of arbitrary diagonal operators into tensor and matrix products of smaller matrices, focusing on the analytic structure of the resulting formulas and their inherent symmetries. Diagrammatic representations are introduced, providing clear visualizations of the structure of these decompositions. We also discuss symmetries of the suggested decomposition. Methods and representations developed in this paper can be applied in different areas, including optimization of quantum computing algorithms, complex biological analysis, crystallography, optimization of AI models, and others.</description>

      <title>Floquet resonances and redshift-enhanced acceleration radiation from vibrating atoms in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study acceleration radiation from a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector that undergoes small-amplitude radial oscillations at fixed mean radius $R_0$ outside a Schwarzschild black hole. The massless scalar field is quantized in the Boulware vacuum to isolate curvature-modulated acceleration effects without a thermal Hawking background. Working in a (1+1) radial reduction and using first-order time-dependent perturbation, we evaluate the period-averaged transition rate (or the "Floquet" transition rate). The resulting particle emission spectrum exhibits a thermal Bose-Einstein-type profile with periodic trajectory yielding a Floquet resonance condition $n\Omega &gt; \omega_0$ and a closed-form expression for the Floquet transition rate $\overline{P}_n$ which reduces to the flat Minkowski spacetime result as $R_0\to\infty$. Near the horizon, $f(R_0)&lt;1$ enhances the effective Bessel argument by $1/\sqrt{f(R_0)}$, providing a simple analytic demonstration of curvature/redshift amplification of acceleration radiation. In particular, the spectrum weighted by Bessel function becomes ill-defined near the black hole horizon as $R_{0}\rightarrow 2M$, possibly manifesting the well-known pathological behavior of Boulware vacuum state. We discuss the regime of validity (small amplitude, $R_0$ away from the horizon) and outline the extensions to (3+1) dimensions, including density-of-states and greybody factors, and to alternative vacuum choices. Our results offer an analytically tractable link between flat-space "vibrating atom" proposals and black-hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>More Effective RS Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive the effective theory for a stabilized five-dimensional warped geometry, addressing several outstanding issues in this derivation. These include allowing for a non-zero 4d cosmological constant, accounting for constraints from both the UV and IR branes, and determining how the stabilized theory responds to an energy perturbation on each brane. We show how a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must respect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein equation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant must be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing fields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra dimension. We show explicitly how this works in a 5d model, and how the correct 4d effective potential reproduces this behavior. We find that the cosmological constant generated from adding energy to one of the branes is unaffected by the details of the stabilization mechanism at leading order, despite the need for the stabilizing fields to adjust. In anticipation of a companion paper, we also briefly discuss how supersymmetry can be realized consistently in the 5d theory. In particular, we show how the stabilization mechanism remains consistent with sequestering, even as the supersymmetry-breaking energy is reflected in the stabilizing field throughout the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the phase structure and thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of elementary magnets carrying the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through two-body quadratic interactions. Such systems have a continuous $SU(N)$ symmetry as well as a discrete conjugation symmetry. We uncover a rich spectrum of phases and transitions, involving a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist as stable and metastable states in different combinations over a range of temperatures. The ferromagnetic phases break $SU(N)$ invariance in various channels, leading to spontaneous magnetization. Interestingly, the conjugation symmetry also breaks over a range of temperatures and group ranks $N$, providing a realization of a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We show that the minimal query complexity for preparing $f(H)\ket{\psi_0}$ is exactly the optimal polynomial approximation degree of $f$ in $L^2(\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the spectral measure of $(H,\ket{\psi_0})$. This state-aware perspective refines the worst-case bounds, unifies Krylov/Favard approximation with quantum queries, and explains how state-dependent spectral structure can yield substantial savings over uniform designs.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated tilt of isocurvature fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields acquire isocurvature fluctuations during inflation. While these fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small scales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave background observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the inflationary Hubble scale, $m\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is flat. Meanwhile, if $m\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but avoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a coincidence of scales $m\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we show that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary dynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted spectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically, if its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition $V''&lt;3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the boundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to $H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of $e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived, this mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which is insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar field with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to constitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses. We compute the relationship between the mass and self-coupling of quartic dark matter predicted by this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Aspects of holographic complexity and volume of the black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the complexity growth rate for Banados Teitlboim Zanelli, Schwarzschild, Reissner Nordstrom, and Kerr black holes using complexity-volume (CV) and complexity-action (CA) dualities and verify that it is proportional to the product of the horizon temperature and entropy of the black holes as conjectured by Susskind. Furthermore, we explore the variation in the complexity growth rate $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ under various physical processes, including the Penrose process, superradiance, particle accretion, and Hawking radiation, and demonstrate that $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ exhibits non-trivial behavior. Under the Penrose process and superradiance, $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ always increases, and under particle accretion, $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ can increase, remain zero, or decrease depending upon the direction of angular momentum of an infalling particle. For the cases of particle accretion, where we find $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ to be negative, we argue that for a reliable estimate, one has to take into account the contribution of the horizon dynamics of the perturbed black hole to the growth of its complexity.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we review the well known ambiguity in defining angular momentum (and mass dipole) fluxes in general relativity and we reinterpret recent works that resolve the ambiguity by defining invariant charges. We resolve the ambiguity by finding the conditions that fix a frame for supertranslation and for space-time translation. We also present an elementary method for measuring the angular momentum aspect and work out explicitly the supertranslation frame-fixing conditions for the metric created by point particles to first nontrivial order in the Newton constant.</description>

      <title>New Tests of Low-Scale Quantum Gravity with Cosmic-Ray Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray collisions at high center of mass energy could enable graviton and black hole production as expected in theories of low-scale quantum gravity, such as extra-dimensions, many species, or some versions of string theory. Here we propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first consider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and photons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data from the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of gravity of $M_f \gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could raise this bound to $M_f \gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of pairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated cosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This consideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental scales of $M_f \gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal neutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced in cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that expected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would produce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky where no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton propagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe.</description>

Abstract: Heavy-light-flavor meson resonances with charm, in the $D^0$ and $D^*$ families, and charmonium-like states, in the $\eta_c$ and $\chi_{c1}$ families, are explored and discussed in the AdS/QCD model with four quark flavors. The differential configurational entropy is computed and analyzed for these four charmed meson families, also combining 4-flavor AdS/QCD to experimental data for the $D^0$, $D^*$, $\eta_c$, and $\chi_{c1}$ meson families. It makes it possible to predict the mass spectrum of unexplored heavier charmed meson resonances and to identify further charmed meson states reported in PDG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the hierarchy problem of the standard model of particle physics can be solved by adding a state-dependent term to the Higgs sector. We present an example of a scalar field with a Higgs-like potential with an additional term proportional to the expectation value of the squared Higgs field operator. We show that the mass can be parametrically lighter than the theory's energy-momentum cutoff without fine tuning. We find the Higgs mass can be technically natural, even with a Planck-scale cutoff. The simplest version of the theory may not be distinguishable from the standard model at colliders, but other versions might. In addition, some aspects of cosmological evolution can be different in this model, in some cases radically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a secondary potential barrier, forming a potential well outside the event horizon, can destabilize the Quasinormal Mode (QNM) spectrum of black holes. We find that spectral instability may persist even after the potential well vanishes, giving rise to a distinct family of spectrally unstable QNMs that differ from the spectrally stable modes localized near the potential peak and associated with the photon sphere. Nevertheless, time-domain simulations reveal that early-time ringdown waveforms remain dominated by stable modes, while unstable modes have only a subdominant contribution. These results highlight the robustness of black hole spectroscopy, as the observable ringdown signal is primarily governed by the most stable QNMs.</description>

      <title>Gradient-flowed operator product expansion without IR renormalons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem concerns the question how to consistently combine perturbative expansions in QCD with power corrections in the context of the operator product expansion (OPE), since the former exhibit ambiguities due to infrared renormalons, which are of the same order as the power corrections. We propose to use the gradient flow time $1/\sqrt{t}$ as a factorization scale and to express the OPE in terms of IR renormalon-free subtracted perturbative expansions and unambiguous matrix elements of gradient-flow regularized local operators. We show on the example of the Adler function and its leading power correction from the gluon condensate that this method dramatically improves the convergence of the perturbative expansion. We employ lattice data on the action density to estimate the gradient-flowed gluon condensate, and obtain the Adler function with non-perturbative accuracy and significantly reduced theoretical uncertainty, enlarging the predictivity at low $Q^2$. When applied to the hadronic decay width of the tau lepton, the method resolves the long-standing discrepancy between the fixed-order and contour-improved approach in favour of the fixed-order treatment.</description>

Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</description>

      <title>A q-analogue of Mirzakhani's recursion for Weil-Petersson volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define q-analogues of Mirzakhani's recursion for Weil-Petersson volumes and the Stanford-Witten recursion for super Weil-Petersson volumes. Okuyama recently introduced a q-deformation of the Gaussian Hermitian matrix model which produces quasi-polynomials that recover the Weil-Petersson volumes via a rescaled q to 1 limit. The q-deformations of the Weil-Petersson volumes produced here agree with the top degree terms of Okuyama's quasi-polynomials and suggest a variation of Okuyama's methods to the super setting.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the $H_0$ tension through new interacting dark energy model in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta_{\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\delta_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Hessian in the spinfoam models with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general method to prove the non-degeneracy of the Hessian in the spinfoam vertex amplitude for quantum gravity and apply it to the spinfoam models with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$-SF models). By reformulating the problem in terms of the transverse intersection of some submanifolds in the phase space of flat ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections, we demonstrate that the Hessian is non-degenerate for critical points corresponding to non-degenerate, geometric 4-simplices in de Sitter or anti-de Sitter space. Non-degeneracy of the Hessian is an important necessary condition for the stationary phase method to be applicable. With a non-degenerate Hessian, this method not only confirms the connection of the $\Lambda$-SF model to semiclassical gravity, but also shows that there are no dominant contributions from exceptional configurations as in the Barrett-Crane model. Given its general nature, we expect our criterion to be applicable to other spinfoam models under mild adjustments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the construction of a manifestly covariant worldline action from a coadjoint orbit. A coadjoint orbit is a submanifold in the dual vector space of a Lie algebra, generated by coadjoint actions. Since a coadjoint orbit is a symplectic space, we derive the worldline particle action from the symplectic two-form. One subtlety in formulating worldline particle actions from coadjoint orbits is choosing the coordinate system that sufficiently illustrates physical properties of the particles. We introduce Hamiltonian constraints by the defining conditions of the isometry. This allows us to write a manifestly covariant worldline action. We demonstrate our method for both massive and massless particles in Minkowski and AdS spacetime.</description>

      <title>On a $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term in 10d heterotic string theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the low-energy effective actions of two ten-dimensional supersymmetric heterotic strings are different by a $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term even after we turn off the $E_8\times E_8$ and $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields. This will be demonstrated by considering the inflow of normal bundle anomaly to the respective NS5-branes from the bulk. We also find that the $Spin(16)\times Spin(16)$ non-tachyonic non-supersymmetric heterotic string has the same non-zero $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term. We will also explain the relation of our findings to the theory of topological modular forms.
  The paper is written as a string theory paper, except for an appendix translating the content in mathematical terms. We will explain there that our finding identifies a representative of the $\mathbb{Z}/3$-torsion element of $\pi_{-32}\mathrm{TMF}$ as a particular self-dual vertex operator superalgebra of $c=16$ and how we utilize string duality to arrive at this statement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the spindle interpretations of previously known solutions, $AdS_3\times\Sigma\times{S}^1\times{KE}_2^+\times{T}^2$ of type IIB supergravity and $AdS_2\times\Sigma\times{S}^1\times{KE}_4^+\times{T}^2$ of eleven-dimensional supergravity, where $\Sigma$ is a spindle factor. For the $AdS_3$ solutions, the internal space of $\Sigma\times{S}^1\times{KE}_2^+$ was previously known as the $\mathscr{Y}^{p,q}$ manifold, which shares the identical topology of the $Y^{p,q}$ manifolds. Unlike the previously known spindle solutions, the gauged supergravity origin and the field theory dual of the solutions are not clear at the moment. We perform the flux quantizations and calculate the holographic central charge and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the presumed black hole solutions, respectively.</description>

      <title>On brane systems with O${}^+$ planes -- 5d and 6d SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02491v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Higgs branches of field theories with 8 supercharges in 5 and 6 dimensions, focusing on theories realised on 5-brane webs in Type IIB with an O$7^+$ plane, or a D6-D8-NS5 brane system in Type IIA in the presence of an O$8^+$ plane. We find magnetic quivers for the Higgs branches of these theories. The main consequence of the presence of the orientifold is that it renders the magnetic quiver to be non-simply-laced. We propose a contribution of the O$7^+$ to the usual stable intersection number of 5-branes from tropical geometry, and show that it is consistent with Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations of magnetic quivers which represent mass deformations of 5d SQFTs. From the magnetic quivers, we compute phase diagrams and highest weight generating functions for the Higgs branches, enabling us to identify the global form of the flavour symmetry for several families of 5d SQFTs; among them Bhardwaj's rank-1 theory. For 6d theories realised on a $-4$ curve, we observe the appearance of an additional $D_4$ slice on top of the phase diagram as one goes to the tensionless limit.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the "crosscap quench", to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I construct supersymmetric AdS$_3$ vacua of type IIB string theory that exhibit parametric scale separation in the controlled regime. These solutions arise from compactifications on seven-dimensional manifolds equipped with co-closed $G_2$-structures, in the presence of orientifold planes preserving minimal supersymmetry. I focus on $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ orbifolds of a specific solvmanifold and all seven-dimensional nilmanifolds, each requiring distinct configurations of intersecting O5-planes, which are treated in the smeared approximation. Weak string coupling and large volumes can be achieved for classical backgrounds on both nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds by tuning unbounded fluxes to large values. This achieves scale separation in the nilmanifold case, but the same cannot be concluded for the solvmanifolds. Furthermore, for some solutions, the holographic field theory operators dual to the lightest scalar fields have integer conformal dimensions at tree level, as in other scale-separated type IIA orientifold backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: The infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes have historically contributed to much development in understanding fundamental structures in physics. However, the fate of the leading soft singularities of amplitudes in non-trivial background fields has remained largely unknown. In this paper, we derive the leading soft theorems for photons, gluons and gravitons on generic plane wave backgrounds in gauge theory and gravity. The results differ from the flat space results through dependence on the initial conditions of the soft mediator. We also consider the special case of self-dual plane wave backgrounds, and match onto the flat space results when the background is treated perturbatively.</description>

      <title>The hyperplane string, RCFTs, and the swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supergravity features BPS strings whose properties encode highly nontrivial information about the parent 6d theory. We focus on a distinguished set of theories whose string charge lattice is one-dimensional. In geometric theories, the generator of the lattice arises from a D3 brane wrapping the hyperplane class in $\mathbb{P}^2$. This hyperplane string is expected to remain stable even when one ventures beyond the geometric regime where it becomes challenging to verify which candidate 6d theories belong to the swampland. We identify five 6d models which from the perspective of the hyperplane string deviate the most from being geometric. For these theories we are able to provide an exact description of the left-moving sector of the hyperplane string worldsheet theory in terms of a rational conformal field theory and provide evidence for their consistency. In one instance, using RCFT methods we are able to determine the elliptic genus and find that in the unflavored limit it matches with the elliptic genus of geometric models. We argue that the non-geometric model is connected to geometric ones via a sequence of Higgsing transitions. These results lead us to formulate a proposal relating the quantum corrected moduli space of the hyperplane string CFT with a region of the landscape of 6d $(1,0)$ quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a summary of discussions at the recent ITEP-JINR-YerPhI workshop on Vogel theory in Dubna. We consider relation between Vogel divisor(s) and the old Dynkin classification of simple Lie algebras. We consider application to knot theory and the hidden role of Jacobi identities in the definition/invariance of Kontsevich integral, which is the knot polynomial with the values in diagrams, capable of revealing all Vassiliev invariants -- including the ones, not visible in other approaches. Finally we comment on the possible breakdown of Vogel universality after the Jack/Macdonald deformation. Generalizations to affine, Yangian and DIM algebras are also mentioned. Especially interesting could be the search for universality in ordinary Yang-Mills theory and its interference with confinement phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We consider two four-dimensional gauge theories with gauge group $SU(N)$: the $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory and the $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theory obtained as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. In this context, we study a novel class of integrated correlators, namely those involving $n$-coincident Wilson lines and two moment map operators of conformal dimension two. By exploiting supersymmetric localization, we obtain exact expressions for these observables valid in the large-$N$ limit. Furthermore, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we derive their strong coupling expansions.</description>

Our novel result supports the use of worldline quantum field theory in non-trivial background spacetimes to obtain new theoretical insights that can both enhance computational efficiency and provide useful cross-checks of results, particularly in the context of classical binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Type IIA supergravity at one loop: $\alpha'^3$ terms in the metric-dilaton-RR one-form sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circle compactification of M-theory is dual to type IIA string theory, requiring that the dimensional reduction of the M-theory couplings \((t_8 t_8 - \frac{1}{4} \epsilon_8 \epsilon_8) R^4\) must reproduce the type IIA one-loop effective action at order \(\alpha'^3\), including contributions from the metric, dilaton, and RR one-form. Through compactification, we obtain 1,276 couplings involving Riemann, Ricci, and Ricci scalar tensors, along with first and second derivatives of the dilaton and RR one-form. By employing field redefinitions, we reduce these to a basis of 359 independent couplings. Crucially, we observe that the dilaton cannot be entirely removed from the couplings via field redefinitions, even in the pure metric-dilaton sector. We validate our results by showing exact agreement between all four-field couplings and the corresponding string-theory S-matrix elements in the string frame.
  Further, upon compactifying on K3, we demonstrate that the resulting six-dimensional \(\alpha'\) couplings at one-loop level transform under S-duality into the tree-level \(\alpha'\) couplings of heterotic string theory on \(T^4\). This match necessitates carefully chosen field redefinitions for both the type IIA (on K3) and heterotic (on \(T^4\)) sectors, providing a stringent test of the duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the elementary classical and quantum Lifshitz systems. Lifshitz systems are systems where space and time scale anisotropically. That is, there is a constant $z$ such that under scaling by a factor of $\lambda$,
  \begin{equation*}
  \boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \lambda \boldsymbol{x} \text{ and } t\rightarrow \lambda^{z}t
  \end{equation*}
  There are seven Lie groups, called the Lifshitz groups, which characterise all Lifshitz symmetries.
  Elementary classical Lifshitz systems are the symplectic manifolds with a transitive Lifshitz action, which turn out to be coadjoint orbits of the Lifshitz groups and their one-dimensional central extensions up to covering. Elementary quantum Lifshitz systems are the projective unitary irreducible representations of the Lifshitz groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the 1980s, many exact results have been discovered in $2d$ CFT, from critical exponents to correlation functions to complete solutions of certain models. In $d&gt;2$, there is a wealth of numerical results as well as promising analytic approaches, but comparably fewer exact answers.
  The aim of this conference was to review the most promising analytic methods and results in CFT in any dimension. In particular we tried to understand to which extent the $2d$ methods can be extended to $d&gt;2$, and what is missing to exactly solve $d&gt;2$ CFTs.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM). Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH contribution to the DM density by non-detection of their Hawking radiation's effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of DM as PBHs with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g, separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization sources on the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1\% of the total DM. We find that these constraints are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the swampland conjectures with DESI DR1 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The swampland conjectures (SCs) propose constraints on effective field theories that can arise from a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Two prominent SCs suggest that the scalar field excursion and the gradient of the potential should be at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in Planck units. Using the first data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey and model-independent reconstructions of the SC-related quantities at late times, via a machine learning approach known as genetic algorithms, we evaluate the consistency of these reconstructions with the SC expectations. Our results indicate that the reconstructed second SC is several sigmas away from zero, suggesting a steep potential, in contrast to recent model-specific analyses assuming exponential potentials. The novelty of our approach lies in using solely model-independent reconstructions of cosmological observables from DESI, such as the angular diameter distance and the Hubble expansion history. This makes our method readily applicable to forthcoming data from stage IV surveys, providing a framework for further assessing consistency with SCs.</description>

      <title>On the Cutoff Scale Identification of FLRW Cosmology in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections through the functional renormalization group flow of the effective action for gravity. We solve the Einstein equation with quantum improved coupling perturbatively including the case with non-vanishing classical cosmological constant (CC) which was overlooked in the literatures. We discuss what is the suitable identification of the momentum cutoff $k$ with time scale, and find that the choice of the Hubble parameter is suitable for vanishing CC but not so for non-vanishing CC. We suggest suitable identification in this case. The energy-scale dependent running coupling breaks the time translation symmetry and then introduces a new physical scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spinor systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system with Yukawa coupling or the Soler model, generically have bi-frequency solitary wave solutions. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available for a wide range of parameters. We show that only bi-frequency modes can be dynamically stable and suggest that stable bi-frequency modes can serve as storages of the Dark Matter. The approach is based on linear stability results of one-frequency solitary waves in (3+1)D Soler model, which we obtain as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Instantons with continuous conformal symmetries: Hyperbolic and singular monopoles and more, oh my!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout this paper, we comprehensively study instantons with every kind of continuous conformal symmetry. Examples of these objects are hard to come by due to non-linear constraints. However, by applying previous work on moduli spaces, we introduce a linear constraint, whose solution greatly simplifies these non-linear constraints. This simplification not only allows us to easily find a plethora of novel instantons with various continuous conformal symmetries and higher rank structure groups, it also provides a framework for classifying such symmetric objects. We also prove that the basic instanton is essentially the only instanton with two particular kinds of conformal symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the connections between instantons with continuous symmetries and other gauge-theoretic objects: hyperbolic and singular monopoles as well as hyperbolic analogues to Higgs bundles and Nahm data.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the \( \rm B-L \) gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during \( \rm B-L \) symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The comprehension of universal thermodynamic behaviors in the supercritical region is crucial for examining the characteristics of black hole systems under high temperature and pressure. This study is devoted to the analysis of characteristic lines and crossover behaviors within the supercritical region. By making use of the free energy, we introduce three key thermodynamic quantities: scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Our results demonstrate that the Widom line, associated with the maximal scaled variance, can effectively differentiate between small and large black hole-like subphases, each displaying distinct thermodynamic behaviors within the supercritical region. Furthermore, by utilizing quasinormal modes, we identify the Frenkel line, offering a dynamic perspective to distinguish between small and large black hole-like subphases. These contribute to a deeper comprehension of black hole subphases in the supercritical region, thus illuminating new facets of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning and Metaheuristics for Feynman Integral Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new methods for optimizing the integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals, an important computational bottleneck in modern perturbative calculations in quantum field theory. Using the simple example of one-loop massive bubble integrals, we pose the problem of minimizing the number of arithmetic operations in reducing a target integral to master integrals via the Laporta algorithm. This is a nontrivial combinatorial optimization problem over the ordering of IBP equation generation (from pairs of seed integrals and IBP operators) and the ordering of integral elimination. Our first proposed method is reinforcement learning, which involves an agent interacting with an environment in a step-by-step manner and learning the best actions to take given an observation of the environment (in this case, the current state of the IBP reduction process). The second method is using metaheuristics, e.g. simulated annealing, to minimize the computational cost as a black-box function of numerical priority values that control the orderings. For large-scale problems, the number of free parameters can be compressed by using a small neural network to assign priority values. Remarkably, with almost no human guidance, both methods lead to IBP reduction schemes that are competitive with the most efficient human-designed algorithms. We also found interpretable features in the AI results that may be applicable to more complicated problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrostatic equilibrium of multi-Weyl semimetals, a class of systems with Weyl-like quasi-particles but anisotropic dispersion relation $\omega^2 \sim k_\parallel^2 + k_\perp^{2n}$, with $n$ a possitive integer. A characteristic feature of multi-Weyl systems is the lack of Lorentz invariance, instead, they possess the reduced spacetime symmetry $(SO(1,1)\times SO(2))\ltimes \mathbb R^4$. In this work we propose a covariant formulation for the low energy theory, allowing for a minimal coupling of the fermion field to external geometric background and $U(1)$ gauge field. The non-Lorentzian structure of the field theory demands introducing an Aristotelian spacetime analogous to the so-called stringy Newton-Cartan geometry \cite{Andringa:2012uz}. Our proposal allows for a systematic study of the hydrostatic properties via the derivation of the partition function of the system. In addition to multi-Weyl models, our formulation can be applied to systems with similar spacetime symmetry groups, such as Bjorken flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the conformal Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant to extract fall-off conditions of the gravitational fields. The fall-off conditions are consistent with a finite, non-trivial presymplectic current on the future boundary of de Sitter. Hence our result allows a non-zero gravitational flux across the boundary of the de Sitter. We present an explicit gauge-free computation to show that the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term, counterterm in the action, and fall-off condition of gravitational field in conformal Einstein equation are crucial to reproduce the finite symplectic flux.</description>

      <title>Dark higher-form portals and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar or vector particles are among the most studied dark matter candidates. Yet, those are always described as scalar or vector fields. In this paper, we explore instead the embedding of the scalar particle in an antisymmetric rank-three tensor field, and the dark photon into an antisymmetric rank-two tensor field (a so-called Kalb-Ramond field), and construct minimal bases of effective interactions with Standard Model fields. Then, keeping phenomenological applications as our main objective, a number of theoretical aspects are clarified, in particular related to the impact of existing dualities among the corresponding free theories, and concerning their Stueckelberg representations. Besides, for the rank-two field, we present for the first time its full propagator, accounting for the possible presence of a pseudoscalar mass term. Thanks to these results, and with their different kinematics, gauge-invariant limits, and Lorentz properties, we show that these higher-form fields provide genuine alternative frameworks, with different couplings and expected signatures at low-energy or at colliders.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>A proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality using a geometric-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality -- a central conjecture in extended black hole thermodynamics -- for black holes in Einstein gravity with $D \geq 4$, employing a two-pronged geometric-analytic method. Our analysis shows that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality originates from the structure of curved backgrounds governed by Einstein's equations, thereby underscoring the fundamental role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric property of AdS black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Symmetric entanglers for non-invertible SPT phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (SPT), due to the lack of a stacking structure, do not have symmetric entanglers (globally symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits) connecting them. Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with $\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).</description>

      <title>Splitting the Gravitational Atom: Instabilities of Black Holes with Synchronized/Resonant Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with synchronized bosonic hair challenge the Kerr paradigm, linking superradiance from ultralight fields -- creating gravitational atoms -- to bosonic stars across parameter space. In the ''very hairy'' regime, where a small horizon lies inside a bosonic star containing most of the energy, they deviate sharply from Kerr, but their dynamics remain unexplored. We show that for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may exist.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Love number of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>
