      <title>Balance with Memory in Signed Networks via Mittag-Leffler Matrix Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural balance is an important characteristic of graphs/networks where edges can be positive or negative, with direct impact on the study of real-world complex systems. When a network is not structurally balanced, it is important to know how much balance still exists in it. Although several measures have been proposed to characterize the degree of balance, the use of matrix functions of the signed adjacency matrix emerges as a very promising area of research. Here, we take a step forward to using Mittag-Leffler (ML) matrix functions to quantify the notion of balance of signed networks. We show that the ML balance index can be obtained from first principles on the basis of a nonconservative diffusion dynamic, and that it accounts for the memory of the system about the past, by diminishing the penalization that long cycles typically receive in other matrix functions. Finally, we demonstrate the important information in the ML balance index with both artificial signed networks and real-world networks in various contexts, ranging from biological and ecological to social ones.</description>

      <title>TGB 2.0: A Benchmark for Learning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Heterogeneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-relational temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling real-world data, capturing the evolving and interconnected nature of entities over time. Recently, many novel models are proposed for ML on such graphs intensifying the need for robust evaluation and standardized benchmark datasets. However, the availability of such resources remains scarce and evaluation faces added complexity due to reproducibility issues in experimental protocols. To address these challenges, we introduce Temporal Graph Benchmark 2.0 (TGB 2.0), a novel benchmarking framework tailored for evaluating methods for predicting future links on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs with a focus on large-scale datasets, extending the Temporal Graph Benchmark. TGB 2.0 facilitates comprehensive evaluations by presenting eight novel datasets spanning five domains with up to 53 million edges. TGB 2.0 datasets are significantly larger than existing datasets in terms of number of nodes, edges, or timestamps. In addition, TGB 2.0 provides a reproducible and realistic evaluation pipeline for multi-relational temporal graphs. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that 1) leveraging edge-type information is crucial to obtain high performance, 2) simple heuristic baselines are often competitive with more complex methods, 3) most methods fail to run on our largest datasets, highlighting the need for research on more scalable methods.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-induced local awareness behavior inferred from surveys and genetic sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior-disease models suggest that if individuals are aware and take preventive actions when the prevalence of the disease increases among their close contacts, then the pandemic can be contained in a cost-effective way. To measure the true impact of local awareness behavior on epidemic spreading, we propose an efficient approach to identify superspreading events and assign corresponding Event Containment Scores (ECSs) in clinical genetic sequence data. We validate ECS as a measure of local awareness in simulation experiments, and we find that ECS was correlated positively with policy stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we observe a temporary drop in ECS during the Omicron wave in most European countries, matching a survey experiment we carried out at the same time. Our findings bring important insight into the field of awareness modeling through the analysis of large-scale genetic sequence data, one of the most promising data sources in epidemics research.</description>

      <title>Temporal Link Prediction in Social Networks Based on Agent Behavior Synchrony and a Cognitive Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporality, a crucial characteristic in the formation of social relationships, was used to quantify the long-term time effects of networks for link prediction models, ignoring the heterogeneity of time effects on different time scales. In this work, we propose a novel approach to link prediction in temporal networks, extending existing methods with a cognitive mechanism that captures the dynamics of the interactions. Our approach computes the weight of the edges and their change over time, similar to memory traces in the human brain, by simulating the process of forgetting and strengthening connections depending on the intensity of interactions. We utilized five ground-truth datasets, which were used to predict social ties, missing events, and potential links. We found: (a) the cognitive mechanism enables more accurate capture of the heterogeneity of the temporal effect, leading to an average precision improvement of 9\% compared to baselines with competitive AUC. (b) the local structure and synchronous agent behavior contribute differently to different types of datasets. (c) appropriately increasing the time intervals, which may reduce the negative impact from noise when dividing time windows to calculate the behavioral synchrony of agents, is effective for link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>LGB: Language Model and Graph Neural Network-Driven Social Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malicious social bots achieve their malicious purposes by spreading misinformation and inciting social public opinion, seriously endangering social security, making their detection a critical concern. Recently, graph-based bot detection methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, our research finds many isolated and poorly linked nodes in social networks, as shown in Fig.1, which graph-based methods cannot effectively detect. To address this problem, our research focuses on effectively utilizing node semantics and network structure to jointly detect sparsely linked nodes. Given the excellent performance of language models (LMs) in natural language understanding (NLU), we propose a novel social bot detection framework LGB, which consists of two main components: language model (LM) and graph neural network (GNN). Specifically, the social account information is first extracted into unified user textual sequences, which is then used to perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the language model to improve its ability to understand social account semantics. Next, the semantically enriched node representation is fed into the pre-trained GNN to further enhance the node representation by aggregating information from neighbors. Finally, LGB fuses the information from both modalities to improve the detection performance of sparsely linked nodes. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LGB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models by up to 10.95%. LGB is already online: https://botdetection.aminer.cn/robotmain.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Vulnerabilities of the Online Public Square to Adversarial Manipulation Tactics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.06130v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media, seen by some as the modern public square, is vulnerable to manipulation. By controlling inauthentic accounts impersonating humans, malicious actors can amplify disinformation within target communities. The consequences of such operations are difficult to evaluate due to the challenges posed by collecting data and carrying out ethical experiments that would influence online communities. Here we use a social media model that simulates information diffusion in an empirical network to quantify the impacts of several adversarial manipulation tactics on the quality of content. We find that the presence of influential accounts, a hallmark of social media, exacerbates the vulnerabilities of online communities to manipulation. Among the explored tactics that bad actors can employ, infiltrating a community is the most likely to make low-quality content go viral. Such harm can be further compounded by inauthentic agents flooding the network with low-quality, yet appealing content, but is mitigated when bad actors focus on specific targets, such as influential or vulnerable individuals. These insights suggest countermeasures that platforms could employ to increase the resilience of social media users to manipulation.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Prediction of User Engagement on Online Social Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of online social platforms hinges on their ability to predict and understand user behavior at scale. Here, we present data suggesting that context-aware modeling approaches may offer a holistic yet lightweight and potentially privacy-preserving representation of user engagement on online social platforms. Leveraging deep LSTM neural networks to analyze more than 100 million Snapchat sessions from almost 80.000 users, we demonstrate that patterns of active and passive use are predictable from past behavior (R2=0.345) and that the integration of context features substantially improves predictive performance compared to the behavioral baseline model (R2=0.522). Features related to smartphone connectivity status, location, temporal context, and weather were found to capture non-redundant variance in user engagement relative to features derived from histories of in-app behaviors. Further, we show that a large proportion of variance can be accounted for with minimal behavioral histories if momentary context is considered (R2=0.442). These results indicate the potential of context-aware approaches for making models more efficient and privacy-preserving by reducing the need for long data histories. Finally, we employ model explainability techniques to glean preliminary insights into the underlying behavioral mechanisms. Our findings are consistent with the notion of context-contingent, habit-driven patterns of active and passive use, underscoring the value of contextualized representations of user behavior for predicting user engagement on social platforms.</description>

      <title>HOT: Higher-Order Dynamic Graph Representation Learning with Efficient Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many graph representation learning (GRL) problems are dynamic, with millions of edges added or removed per second. A fundamental workload in this setting is dynamic link prediction: using a history of graph updates to predict whether a given pair of vertices will become connected. Recent schemes for link prediction in such dynamic settings employ Transformers, modeling individual graph updates as single tokens. In this work, we propose HOT: a model that enhances this line of works by harnessing higher-order (HO) graph structures; specifically, k-hop neighbors and more general subgraphs containing a given pair of vertices. Harnessing such HO structures by encoding them into the attention matrix of the underlying Transformer results in higher accuracy of link prediction outcomes, but at the expense of increased memory pressure. To alleviate this, we resort to a recent class of schemes that impose hierarchy on the attention matrix, significantly reducing memory footprint. The final design offers a sweetspot between high accuracy and low memory utilization. HOT outperforms other dynamic GRL schemes, for example achieving 9%, 7%, and 15% higher accuracy than - respectively - DyGFormer, TGN, and GraphMixer, for the MOOC dataset. Our design can be seamlessly extended towards other dynamic GRL workloads.</description>

      <title>Browsing behavior exposes identities on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How easy is it to uniquely identify a person based solely on their web browsing behavior? Here we show that when people navigate the Web, their online traces produce fingerprints that identify them. Merely the four most visited web domains are enough to identify 95% of the individuals. These digital fingerprints are stable and render high re-identifiability. We demonstrate that we can re-identify 80% of the individuals in separate time slices of data. Such a privacy threat persists even with limited information about individuals' browsing behavior, reinforcing existing concerns around online privacy.</description>
