      <title>Modal Backflow Neural Quantum States for Anharmonic Vibrational Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are a promising ansatz for solving many-body quantum problems due to their inherent expressiveness. Yet, this expressiveness can only be harnessed efficiently for treating identical particles if the suitable physical knowledge is hardwired into the neural network itself. For electronic structure, NQS based on backflow determinants has been shown to be a powerful ansatz for capturing strong correlation. By contrast, the analogue for bosons, backflow permanents, is unpractical due to the steep cost of computing the matrix permanent and due to the lack of particle conservation in common bosonic problems. To circumvent these obstacles, we introduce a modal backflow (MBF) NQS design and demonstrate its efficacy by solving the anharmonic vibrational problem. To accommodate the demand of high accuracy in spectroscopic calculations, we implement a selected-configuration scheme for evaluating physical observables and gradients, replacing the standard stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo sampling. A vibrational self-consistent field calculation is conveniently carried out within the MBF network, which serves as a pretraining step to accelerate and stabilize the optimization. In applications to both artificial and ab initio Hamiltonians, we find that the MBF network is capable of delivering spectroscopically accurate zero-point energies and vibrational transitions in all anharmonic regimes.</description>

      <title>Accelerating inverse materials design using generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models promise to accelerate material design by directly generating novel structures with desired properties, but existing approaches typically require expensive and substantial labeled data ($&gt;$10,000) and lack adaptability. Here we present MatInvent, a general and efficient reinforcement learning workflow that optimizes diffusion models for goal-directed crystal generation. For single-objective designs, MatInvent rapidly converges to target values within 60 iterations ($\sim$ 1,000 property evaluations) across electronic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, and physicochemical properties. Furthermore, MatInvent achieves robust optimization in design tasks with multiple conflicting properties, successfully proposing low-supply-chain-risk magnets and high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MatInvent exhibits superior generation performance under specified property constraints while dramatically reducing the demand for property computation by up to 378-fold. Compatible with diverse diffusion model architectures and property constraints, MatInvent could offer broad applicability in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Exploring the mechanisms of transverse relaxation of copper(II)-phthalocyanine spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum technologies, but their performance is limited by decoherence arising from diverse mechanisms. The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to $T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times. These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits for scalable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>QMeCha: quantum Monte Carlo package for fermions in embedding environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first open access version of the QMeCha (Quantum MeCha) code, a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) package developed to study many-body interactions between different types of quantum particles, with a modular and easy-to-expand structure. The present code has been built to solve the Hamiltonian of a system that can include nuclei and fermions of different mass and charge, e.g. electrons and positrons, embedded in an environment of classical charges and quantum Drude oscillators. To approximate the ground state of this many-particle operator, the code features different wavefunctions. For the fermionic particles, beyond the traditional Slater determinant, QMeCha also includes Geminal functions such as the Pfaffian, and presents different types of explicit correlation terms in the Jastrow factors. The classical point charges and quantum Drude oscillators, described through different variational ans\"atze, are used to model a molecular environment capable of explicitly describing dispersion, polarization, and electrostatic effects experienced by the nuclear and fermionic subsystem. To integrate these wavefunctions, efficient variational Monte Carlo and diffusion Monte Carlo protocols have been developed, together with a robust wavefunction optimization procedure that features correlated sampling. In conclusion, QMeCha is a massively parallel code introduced here to explore quantum correlation effects in mixed systems with thousands of fermions and bosonic particles, beyond what was previously accessible to other reference methods.</description>

      <title>Group 13 Metals as L-Type Ligands for Transition Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-valent Group 13 fragments can serve as neutral two-electron L-type metalloligands to transition-metal (TM) centers, enabling heterometallic M-TM platforms with bonding and reactivity patterns distinct from classical CO, phosphine, and carbene ligation. This chapter develops a unifying, descriptor-based view of aluminylene Al(I), gallylene Ga(I), and indylene In(I) donors, and contrasts them with the limited L-type behavior of Tl(I). We map synthetic gateways to isolable M(I) donors, analyze their sigma-donation/pi-acceptance profiles, and extract periodic design rules in which the sigma-donor strength decreases Al &gt; Ga &gt; In, whereas Tl(I) has not yet been convincingly shown to engage in neutral L-type Tl-&gt;TM coordination. Borderline cases that blur L-, X-, and Z-type classifications are also examined to clarify descriptors and guide consistent usage across the series. This contribution links ligand sterics/electronics, ambiphilicity at M(I), and the chosen TM fragment to guide the rational design of M-TM platforms that harness Group-13 M(I) donors for small-molecule activation and cooperative catalysis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of the Spin-Free Renormalized Internally-Contracted Multireference Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an efficient implementation of the renormalized internally-contracted multreference coupled cluster with singles and doubles (RIC-MRCCSD) into the ORCA quantum chemistry program suite is reported. To this end, Evangelista's Wick&amp;d equation generator was combined with ORCA's native AGE code generator in order to implement the many-body residuals required for the RIC-MRCCSD method. Substantial efficiency gains are realized by deriving a spin-free formulation instead of the previously reported spin-orbital version developed by some of us. Since AGE produces parallelized code, the resulting implementation can directly be run in parallel with substantial speedups when executed on multiple cores. In terms of runtime, the cost of RIC-MRCCSD is shown to be between single-reference RHF-CCSD and UHF-CCSD, even when active space spaces as large as CAS(14,14) are considered. This achievement is largely due to the fact that no reduced density matrices (RDM) or cumulants higher than three-body enter the formalism. The scalability of the method to large systems is furthermore demonstrated by computing the ground-state of a vitamin B12 model comprised of an active space of CAS(12, 12) and 809 orbitals. In terms of accuracy, RIC-MRCCSD is carefully compared to second- and approximate fourth-order $n$-electron valence state perturbation theories (NEVPT2, NEVPT4(SD)), to the multireference zeroth-order coupled-electron pair approximation (CEPA(0)), as well as to the IC-MRCCSD from Kohn. In contrast to RIC-MRCCSD, the IC-MRCCSD equations are entirely derived by AGE using the conventional projection-based approach, which, however, leads to much higher algorithmic complexity than the former as well as the necessity to calculate up to the five-body RDMs. Remaining challenges such as the variation of the results with the flow, a free parameter that enters the RIC-MRCCSD theory, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Encoding electronic ground-state information with variational even-tempered basis sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a system-oriented basis-set design based on even-tempered basis functions to variationally encode electronic ground-state information into molecular orbitals. First, we introduce a reduced formalism of concentric even-tempered orbitals that achieves hydrogen energy accuracy on par with the conventional formalism, with lower optimization cost and improved scalability. Second, we propose a symmetry-adapted, even-tempered formalism specifically designed for molecular systems. It requires only primitive S-subshell Gaussian-type orbitals and uses two parameters to characterize all exponent coefficients. In the case of the diatomic hydrogen molecule, the basis set generated by this formalism produces a dissociation curve more consistent with cc-pV5Z than cc-pVTZ at the size of aug-cc-pVDZ. Finally, we test our even-tempered formalism against several types of tetra-atomic hydrogen molecules for ground-state computation and point out its current limitations and potential improvements.</description>

      <title>Structure and interactions of atoms and diatomic molecules: from ultracold gases to doped solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009. The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena, like photoassociation and collisional shielding.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing of Copper-Phthalocyanine Electron Spins via NV Relaxometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments. The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\sim1$~nm precision. Our results establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Incorporating QM/MM molecular dynamics into the few-mode quantization approach for light-matter interactions in nanophotonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of light-matter interactions between organic chromophores and confined photons of (plasmonic) nano-resonators, we introduce a general framework that couples ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics with few-mode field quantization to simulate light-matter interactions of molecular emitters at the nanoscale. Arbitrary, lossy, and spatially inhomogeneous photonic environments are represented by a minimal set of interacting modes fitted to their spectral density, while geometry-dependent molecular properties are computed on the fly. Applications to few-molecule strong coupling show that strong coupling persists when molecular degrees of freedom and disorder are included for the chosen system consisting of a nanoparticle dimer coupled to multiple emitters. At the same time, symmetry-protected degeneracies of two-level models are lifted. The framework further reveals how spatial field inhomogeneity and molecular disorder shape cavity-mediated energy transfer, illustrated for an HBQ-Methylene Blue donor-acceptor combination in a five-emitter system.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation using energy sampling and extrapolation enhanced Clifford data regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>

      <title>Flow matching for reaction pathway generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating reaction mechanisms hinges on efficiently generating transition states (TSs), products, and complete reaction networks. Recent generative models, such as diffusion models for TS sampling and sequence-based architectures for product generation, offer faster alternatives to quantum-chemistry searches. But diffusion models remain constrained by their stochastic differential equation (SDE) dynamics, which suffer from inefficiency and limited controllability. We show that flow matching, a deterministic ordinary differential (ODE) formulation, can replace SDE-based diffusion for molecular and reaction generation. We introduce MolGEN, a conditional flow-matching framework that learns an optimal transport path to transport Gaussian priors to target chemical distributions. On benchmarks used by TSDiff and OA-ReactDiff, MolGEN surpasses TS geometry accuracy and barrier-height prediction while reducing sampling to sub-second inference. MolGEN also supports open-ended product generation with competitive top-k accuracy and avoids mass/electron-balance violations common to sequence models. In a realistic test on the $\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide decomposition network, MolGEN yields higher fractions of valid and intended TSs with markedly fewer quantum-chemistry evaluations than string-based baselines. These results demonstrate that deterministic flow matching provides a unified, accurate, and computationally efficient foundation for molecular generative modeling, signaling that flow matching is the future for molecular generation across chemistry.</description>

      <title>Gold-Standard Chemical Database 137 (GSCDB137): A diverse set of accurate energy differences for assessing and developing density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GSCDB137, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 137 data sets (8377 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and barrier heights, (intramolecular) non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spin-contaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density functional approximations (DFAs) confirms the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall but also reveals notable exceptions: functional performance for frequencies and electric-field properties correlates poorly with that for other ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the meta-GGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment. GSCDB137 offers a comprehensive, openly documented platform for stringent DFA validation and for training the next generation of non-empirical and machine-learned functionals.</description>

      <title>eT 2.0: An efficient open-source molecular electronic structure program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eT program is an open-source electronic structure program with emphasis on performance and modularity. As its name suggests, the program features extensive coupled cluster capabilities, performing well compared to other electronic structure programs, and, in some cases, outperforming commercial alternatives. However, eT is more than a coupled cluster program; other models based on wave function theory (such as full and reduced space configuration interaction and a variety of self-consistent field models) and density functional theory are supported. The second major release of the program, eT 2.0, has specialized functionality for strong light-matter coupling conditions. In addition, it includes a wide range of optimizations and algorithmic improvements, as well as new capabilities for exploring potential energy surfaces and for modeling experiments in the UV and X-ray regimes. Molecular gradients are now available at the coupled cluster level, and high-accuracy spectroscopic simulations are available at reduced computational cost within the multilevel coupled cluster and multiscale frameworks. We present the modifications to the program since its first major release, eT 1.0, highlighting some notable new features and demonstrating the performance of the new version relative to the first release and to other established electronic structure programs.</description>

      <title>On the Connection of High-Resolution NMR Spectrum Mirror Symmetry With Spin System Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A correlation between the symmetry of NMR spectra, including higher-order spectra, and the properties of the spin system has been established. It is shown that for a spectrum to be symmetric about the mid-resonance frequency ({\nu}0), two conditions must be satisfied: the resonant frequencies of the spins must be symmetrically positioned about {\nu}0, and the J coupling matrix must be symmetric about the secondary diagonal. The results were validated by calculating theoretical spectra for 4-, 5-, and 6-spin systems.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</description>

      <title>DiffSpectra: Molecular Structure Elucidation from Spectra using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a fundamental challenge in molecular science. Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the roles of hydrophobicity and electrostatics in the particle-scale dynamics and rheology of dense microgel suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal microgel particles such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) shrink reversibly in an aqueous medium due to the expulsion of water at a volume phase transition temperature, VPTT $\sim$33$^\circ$C. Romeo et al. [Adv. Mater. 2010, 22, 3441-3445] had previously shown that dense aqueous PNIPAM suspensions transformed from one viscoelastic solid-like phase to another when suspension temperature was increased, with an intermediate viscoelastic liquid-like phase near the VPTT. They attributed this observation to a change in the inter-particle interaction from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Here, we show using a combination of experimental techniques that particle hydrophobicity can become significant even below the VPTT. We achieve this by incorporating dissociating additives such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, or non-dissociating additives such as sucrose, into the aqueous medium. Above the VPTT, we observe that suspension rigidity is the highest in the presence of salts because of the combined effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic attractions. In the presence of non-dissociating sucrose, in contrast, the inter-microgel interaction remains hydrophobic across the VPTT. Such easy tunability of interactions by incorporating commonly available chemicals into the suspension medium opens up new avenues for the synthesis of novel metamaterials.</description>
