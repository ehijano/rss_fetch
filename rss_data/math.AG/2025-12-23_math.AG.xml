      <title>Counting $h^0(D)$ on primary Burniat surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of divisors on a Burniat surface $X$ with $K_X^2=6$. We provide an algorithm for computing the cohomology groups of arbitrary divisors on $X$. As an application, we prove that there are no Ulrich line bundles\,(with respect to an arbitrary polarization), and that there exists an Ulrich vector bundle of rank 2 with respect to $3K_X$. The existence of Ulrich vector bundle of rank 2 was previously established by Casnati, but our construction yields one that cannot be obtained by his method.</description>

      <title>On the Nash Problem over 3-Fold Terminal Singularities of Type cAx/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Nash valuations on 3-fold terminal singularities, especially in type cAx/2. We find that, in type cAx/2, exceptional prime divisors computing the minimal discrepancy (which is 1/2 in this case) induce Nash valuations. We conjecture this in general for all 3-fold terminal singularities, and provide some evidence in the Gorenstein case.</description>

      <title>Kuznetsov Categories for Gauged Linear Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define Kuznetsov and anti-Kuznetsov categories for gauged linear sigma models. We show that for complete intersections of ample divisors in smooth projective toric varieties, the Kuznetsov category is left orthogonal to an exceptional collection. We prove that any complete intersection of $r \ge 2$ ample divisors in a Fano GIT quotient is a Fano visitor and the derived category of its Fano host is equivalent to an anti-Kuznetsov category of a gauged linear sigma model.</description>

      <title>The Euclidean distance degree of curves: from rational to line multiview varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean distance (ED) degree is an invariant that measures the algebraic complexity of optimizing the distance function of a point to a model. It has been studied in algebraic statistics, machine learning, and computer vision. In this article, we prove a formula for the ED degree of curves parameterized by rational functions with mild genericity assumptions. We apply our results to resolve conjectures on one-dimensional line multiview varieties from computer vision proposed by Duff and Rydell.</description>

      <title>On bicanonical maps of threefolds of general type with large volumes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any smooth projective $3$-fold of general type with canonical volume greater than $12^6$, the image of its bicanonical map has dimension at least $2$. We also study pluricanonical maps of $3$-folds of general type with large canonical volume and fibered by $(1,2)$-surfaces or $(2,3)$-surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Problem of Mixed-Tateness of the Motives of G-Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on earlier work concerning the motives of $G$-bundles, we study the structure of motives associated with certain classes of $G$-varieties. In particular, we show that the corresponding motives lie within the category of mixed-Tate motives, under certain condition on the stabilizers. We further discuss some applications and provide some examples to illustrate the limitations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of torsion-free sheaves and birational geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of \emph{hierarchical filtrations} of torsion-free sheaves on normal projective varieties and define the associated numerical invariant called \emph{hierarchical depth}. This invariant measures the maximal length of filtrations by saturated subsheaves of equal rank whose successive quotients are torsion sheaves supported in codimension one.
  We establish general bounds for hierarchical depth in terms of the divisor class of the determinant and give exact formulas in several basic geometric situations, including the case of smooth projective curves and varieties of Picard rank one. A key technical ingredient is the study of elementary transforms along effective divisors and their commutativity properties.
  In dimension two, we analyze the behavior of hierarchical depth under birational morphisms and show that it admits a precise description along the minimal model program. In particular, we prove that hierarchical depth transforms additively with respect to exceptional divisors and is explicitly computable on minimal models.
  As an application, we relate hierarchical depth to degeneracies in algebraic--geometric codes and show that birational simplification via the minimal model program leads to effective improvements of code parameters. These results demonstrate that hierarchical depth provides a new bridge between the birational geometry of vector bundles and arithmetic applications.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of varieties over the maximal Kummer extension of a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective geometrically connected variety defined over a number field $K$. We prove that the geometric \'etale cohomology of $X$ with $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients has finitely many classes invariant under the Galois group of the maximal Kummer extension of $K$ in odd degrees. In particular, every abelian variety has finite torsion over the maximal Kummer extension. This improves results by R\"ossler and the second author as well as Murotani and Ozeki. We also show that finiteness of torsion of a given abelian variety over non-abelian solvable extensions of $K$ is not controlled by the Galois group of the extension.</description>

      <title>Irrational pencils, and characterization of Varieties isogenous to a product, via the Profinite completion of the Fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a very short proof of two Theorems, whose content is outlined in the title, and where $\Pi_g$ is the fundamental group of a compact complex curve of genus $g$:
  (1) Theorem 2.1 of the irrational pencil in the profinite version, saying that for a compact K\"ahler manifold an irrational pencil, that is, a fibration onto a curve of genus $g \geq 2$, corresponds to a surjection of the profinite completion $\widehat{\pi}_1(X) \twoheadrightarrow \widehat{\Pi_g}$, which satisfies a maximality property;
  (2) Theorem 1.4 on the characterization of varieties isogenous to a product, profinite version, giving in particular a criterion for $X$ a compact K\"ahler manifold to be isomorphic to a product of curves of genera at least 2: if and only if $\widehat{\pi}_1(X) \cong \prod_1^n \widehat{\Pi_{g_i}}$, and some volume or cohomological condition is satisfied.
  Theorem 1.4 yields a stronger result than the Main Theorem A of a recent article by 5 authors.</description>

      <title>Enriques surfaces with non-generic non-degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-degeneracy invariant $\mathrm{nd}(Y)$ of complex Enriques surfaces in families. Our first main result shows that $\mathrm{nd}(Y)$ cannot increase under specialization. The second main result is the conclusion of the computation of the non-degeneracy invariant for the $155$ families of $(\tau,\overline{\tau})$-generic surfaces introduced by Brandhorst and Shimada. Of the previously known $144$ cases, only $3$ satisfy $\mathrm{nd}(Y)\neq10$, which is the non-degeneracy invariant of a general Enriques surface. The remaining $11$ families studied in this article also have non-generic non-degeneracy. To compute this, we produce upper bounds on $\mathrm{nd}(Y)$ by refining this invariant into two others: the Fano and Mukai non-degeneracy invariants, which are related to two different classes of projective realizations of Enriques surfaces. As a result, we find the first known examples of Enriques surfaces with $\mathrm{nd}(Y)=9$.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Bass--Quillen conjecture in dimension 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a regular ring of dimension $\le 2$. Let $G$ be a reductive group over $A$ such that its derived group is a split, i.e. a Chevalley--Demazure, semisimple group. We prove that every Zariski-locally trivial principal $G$-bundle over $A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is extended from $A$, for any $n\ge 1$. This result generalizes to split reductive groups the dimension $2$ case of the Bass--Quillen conjecture on finitely generated projective modules, settled in positive by M. P. Murthy.</description>

      <title>Genus~0 Gromov-Witten theory of even dimensional complete intersections of two quadrics: the final step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even dimensional complete intersections $X$ of two quadrics in projective space are exceptional from the point of view of the Gromov-Witten theory: they are (together with qubic surfaces) the only complete intersections whose Gromov-Witten theory is not invariant under the full orthogonal or symplectic group acting on the primitive cohomology. The genus~0 Gromov-Witten theory of $X$ was studied by Xiaowen Hu. He used geometric arguments and the WDVV equation to compute all genus~0 correlators except one, which cannot be determined by his methods. In this paper we compute the remaining Gromov-Witten invariant of $X$ using Jun Li's degeneration formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seminal paper of Borel and Tits about reductive groups, they show some fundamental results about Bruhat cells with respect to a minimal parabolic subgroup, e.g., relative Bruhat decomposition and its geometrization, relative Bruhat order and the relation of Zariski closure and topological closure. In this paper, we show analogous results for Bruhat cells of wonderful group compactification in the sense of De Concini and Procesi. Our results can be viewed as the version at infinity of those of Borel and Tits. Our main focus is general base field. When the base field is algebraically closed, most of our results are proved by Brion and Springer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a strong version of the geometric Merkurjev-Panin conjecture holds for the Cox category of a projective toric variety. That is, we prove that the full strong exceptional collection of Bondal-Thomsen line bundles is invariant under the group of lattice automorphisms that permute the rays of the toric variety's fan. Our result is meant to further illustrate that the Cox category is a natural repository for homological algebra on toric varieties.</description>

      <title>De Rham affineness of the Nygaard filtered prismatization in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect ring of characteristic $p&gt;0$, and let $R$ be an animated $k$-algebra. This note aims to show that the Nygaard filtered prismatization $R^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of $R$ is naturally isomorphic, as a stack over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$, to the relative spectrum over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of the Rees algebra of the Nygaard filtered prismatic cohomology of $R$ relative to $k$. In doing so, we axiomatise the functorial affineness property displayed by the relative Nygaard filtered prismatization, and dub it de Rham affineness after the fundamental example of the functor sending an animated ring to its relative de Rham stack. While we treat this concept as an organising tool for the author's forthcoming work on the syntomification of Frobenius liftable schemes, we are able to frame some questions based on a structural theorem of independent interest: a functor to stacks which is de Rham affine often arises via ring stacks through transmutation.</description>

Abstract: We determine the Picard number and the Ulrich complexity of general bidouble covers of the projective plane, providing the first systematic study of Ulrich bundles on non-cyclic abelian covers. For a bidouble plane branched along three smooth curves of degrees $n_1,n_2,n_3$, we show that $\rho(S)=1$ unless $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ belongs to an explicit list, thereby extending Buium's classical results on double planes to the non-cyclic case. As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist, and we show that every even bidouble plane carries a special rank-two Ulrich bundle. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Kawamata-Morrison cone conjecture for Q-factorial terminal projective primitive symplectic varieties with second Betti number greater than five defined over a field of characteristic zero. As an application, we prove that the relative movable and the relative nef cone conjectures hold for fibrations whose very general fibre is a projective primitive symplectic varieties under certain assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that any Mori fiber space birational to a minimal smooth del Pezzo surface $S$ of degree $4$ is either a del Pezzo surface of degree $4$ itself, or a smooth cubic surface with a structure of a relatively minimal conic bundle. We show that any del Pezzo surface of degree $4$ birational to $S$ is actually isomorphic to $S$. Also, we sketch an equivariant version of this fact. On the way, we review the biregular classification of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $4$ obtained by A. N. Skorobogatov.</description>

Abstract: We study reciprocity laws involving complex line bundles on fibrations in oriented circles. In particularly, we prove the following reciprocity law. Let $B$ be a complex manifold and $\pi_i : M_i \to B$ be a fibration in oriented circles, where $i$ runs through a finite set. Let $L_i$ and $N_i$ be complex line bundles on every $M_i$. The reciprocity law states that the sum of all $(\pi_i)_* \left(c_1(L_i) \cup c_1(N_i) \right)$, where $(\pi_i)_*$ is the Gysin map and $c_1$ is the first Chern class, equals zero in $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ when the disjoint union of all $M_i$ is embedded into a holomorphic family of compact Riemann surfaces over the base $B$ such that in every fiber of this family the disjoint union of the embedded circles is the boundary of an embedded compact Riemann surface with boundary, and all $L_i$ and all $N_i$ are restrictions of holomorphic line bundles on this family.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a theory of isolated hypersurface singularities in mixed characteristic $(0,p)$, focusing on quotient rings over a Discrete Valuation Ring (DVR). We introduce and study analogues of the classical Tjurina and Milnor numbers for this setting, prove a generalized analogue of the determinacy theorem and the Mather-Yau Theorem for complete Noetherian local rings, and define numerical invariants that provide distinct criteria for detecting isolated singularities in the unramified and ramified cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Sigma_b$ be a compact Riemann surface of genus $b \geq 2$ and let $\mathsf{P}_2(\Sigma_b)=\pi_1(\Sigma_b \times \Sigma_b - \Delta)$ be the corresponding pure braid group on two strands. A finite quotient $\varphi \colon \mathsf{P}_2(\Sigma_b) \to G$ is called "admissible" if $\varphi$ does not factor through $\pi_1(\Sigma_b \times \Sigma_b)$. In this work we classify all admissible quotients of $\mathsf{P}_2(\Sigma_b)$ such that $|G| \leq 127$.</description>

      <title>The number of rooted spanning forests of bicirculant graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bi-Cayley graph over the cyclic group $(\mathbb{Z}_n, +)$ is called a bicirculant graph. Let $\Gamma=BC(\mathbb{Z}_n; R,T,S)$ be a bicirculant graph with $R=-R\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $T={-}T\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$. In this paper, using Chebyshev polynomials, we obtain a closed formula for the number of rooted spanning forests of $\Gamma$. Moreover, we investigate some arithmetic properties of the number of rooted spanning forests of $\Gamma$, and find its asymptotic behaviour as $n$ tends infinity.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Deformations of Hyperbolicity Notions on Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate deformation properties of balanced hyperbolicity, with particular emphasis on degenerate balanced manifolds and their behavior under modifications.
  In this context, we introduce two new notions of hyperbolicity for compact non-K\"ahler manifolds $X$ of complex dimension $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}X=n$ in degree $1 \leq p \leq n-1$, inspired by the work of F. Haggui and S. Marouani on $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity. The first notion, called \emph{p-SKT hyperbolicity}, generalizes the notions of SKT hyperbolicity and Gauduchon hyperbolicity introduced by S. Marouani. The second notion, called \emph{p-HS hyperbolicity}, extends the notion of sG hyperbolicity defined by Y. Ma.
  We investigate the relationship between these notions of analytic nature and their geometric counterparts, namely Kobayashi hyperbolicity and \emph{p-cyclic hyperbolicity} for $2 \leq p \leq n-1$, and we examine the openness under holomorphic deformations of both $p$-HS hyperbolicity and $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Attention Is Not What You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a basic question in sequence modeling: is explicit self-attention actually necessary for strong performance and reasoning? We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.
  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.
  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511. We analyze the complexity of Grassmann mixing, show linear scaling in sequence length for fixed rank, and argue that such manifold-based designs offer a more structured route toward geometric and invariant-based interpretations of neural reasoning.</description>

      <title>Open Quantum Systems as Regular Holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-Modules: The Mixed Hodge Structure of Spectral Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric description of open quantum systems via the Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT) traditionally relies on the assumption that the physical states form a differentiable vector bundle over the parameter manifold. This framework becomes ill-posed at spectral singularities, such as Exceptional Points, where the eigen-bundle admits no local trivialization due to dimension reduction. In this work, we resolve this obstruction by demonstrating that the family of Liouvillian superoperators $\mathcal{L}(k)$ over a complex parameter manifold $X$ canonically defines a \textbf{regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_X$-module} $\mathcal{M}$. By identifying the physical coherence order with the Hodge filtration and the decay rate hierarchy with the \textbf{Kashiwara filtration}, we show that the open quantum system underlies a \textbf{Mixed Hodge Module (MHM)} structure in the sense of Saito.
  This identification allows us to apply the \textbf{Grothendieck six-functor formalism} rigorously to dissipative dynamics. We prove that the divergence corresponds to a non-trivial cohomology class in $\text{Ext}^1_{\mathcal{D}_X}$, thereby regularizing the Quantum Geometric Tensor without ad-hoc cutoffs. Specifically, the ``singular component'' of the Complete QGT arises as the residue of the connection on the \textbf{Brieskorn lattice} associated with the vanishing cycles functor.</description>

      <title>The monodromy of cyclic Pryms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The {\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\mathbb{P}}^1_{{\mathbb{F}}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we point out the natural relation between $\mathbb Q$-twisted objects of the derived category of abelian varieties, cohomological rank functions, and semihomogeneous vector bundles. We apply this to two basic classes of objects, corresponding to each other via the Fourier-Mukai-Poincar\'e transform: positive twists of the ideal sheaf of one point and of the evaluation complexes of ample simple semihomogeneous vector bundles. This naturally leads to the introduction of $\mathbb Q^{\ge 0}$- graded section modules associated to line bundles on abelian varieties built by means of semihomogeneous vector bundles (containing the usual section rings). We prove a duality relation between such modules associated to dual polarizations, which is not visible at the level of the usual section rings. Other applications include formulas relating the thresholds of relevant cohomological rank functions appearing in this context. As a consequence we show a lower bound for the base point free threshold of a polarization in function of its type, and some obstructions to surjectivity of multiplication maps of global sections of certain line bundles.</description>

Abstract: We analyze finite orbits of the natural braid group action on the character variety of the $n$ times punctured sphere. Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite.</description>

      <title>Log Canonical Minimal Model Program for corank one foliations on Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $(X, \mcF, \D)$ is a projective rank two foliated log canonical triple such that $(X,B)$ is klt for some $0 \leq B \leq \D$, we show that we can run a $(K_\mcF +\Delta)$-MMP and any such MMP terminates with either a minimal model or Mori fiber space. Next, we establish a Bertini type lemma and adjunction for generalized foliated quadruples. Using these, we extend the full log canonical MMP to the setting of rank two NQC generalized foliated quadruples. Finally, we apply the generalized MMP to study the relation between different minimal models, namely, any two minimal models of a given foliated log canonical triple can be connected by a sequence of flops and in the boundary polarized case, the minimal models are good and only finitely many in number.</description>

Abstract: We show that a compact K\"ahler manifold $M$ containing a smooth connected divisor $D$ such that $M \setminus D$ is a homology cell, e.g., contractible, must be projective space with $D$ a hyperplane, provided $\dim M \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. This answers conjectures of Fujita in these dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the discriminant of a polynomial, which we call the tolerant. The tolerant differs by multiplication by a square from the duplicant, which was discovered in recent work on $\mathbb{P}^1$-loop spaces in motivic homotopy theory. We show that the tolerant is rational by deriving a formula in terms of discriminants. This allows us to formulate a conjectural unstable Poincar\'e--Hopf formula over an arbitrary locus of points. We also show that the tolerant satisfies many of the same properties as the discriminant. A notable difference between the two is that the discriminant is inversion invariant for all polynomials, whereas the tolerant is only inversion invariant on a proper multiplicative subset of polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the combinatorial properties of conic arrangements in the complex projective plane that possess certain quasi-homogeneous singularities. First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize the property of being plus-one generated within the class of conic arrangements with some naturally chosen quasi-homogeneous singularities. Next, we present a classification result on plus-one generated conic arrangements admitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results regarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples of strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements -- that is, arrangements having the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we show that if $f\colon M\rightarrow X$ is a germ of a projective Lagrangian fibration from a holomorphic symplectic manifold $M$ onto a normal analytic variety $X$ with isolated quotient singularities, then $X$ is smooth. In particular, if $f\colon M\rightarrow X$ is a Lagrangian fibration from a hyper-K\"ahler fourfold $M$ onto a normal surface $X$, then $X\cong \mathbb{P}^2$, which recovers a recent result of Huybrechts--Xu and Ou.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a polarised Calabi-Yau threefold $(X,H)$. We reduce a version of the Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda conjecture for $(X,H)$, which ensures the existence of Bridgeland stability conditions on $X$, to verifying a Brill-Noether-type inequality for curves on $X$. We then prove this inequality for a broad class of Calabi-Yau threefolds, including complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds in weighted projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous spaces over an abelian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a question of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Iyer concerning the existence of rational sections in families of homogeneous spaces over an abelian variety, after base change by a suitable \'etale isogeny of the abelian variety. Assuming characteristic zero and that the homogeneous spaces arise from connected reductive groups, the problem is reformulated in terms of torsors under reductive groups over an abelian variety $A$.
  Building on work of Moonen and Polishchuk, we construct a filtration on the motive of a Jacobian variety to analyze the action of isogenies on unramified cohomology and Witt groups. This approach allows for a positive response to the question for reductive groups whose root data do not contain a factor of type~$E_8$ when $\dim A &gt; 2$ and $\mathrm{cd}(k) \leqslant 1$, and for all reductive groups when $\dim A = 2$ and $k$ is algebraically closed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define several versions of a class of varieties $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ attached to a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, generalizing the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane. These include trigonometric and elliptic versions attached to the corresponding groups. We also define the corresponding isospectral varieties $Y_{\mathfrak{g}}$. We prove a Gordon-Stafford localization theorem for $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the corresponding equal-parameter rational Cherednik algebras, relate these varieties to the affine Springer fiber-sheaf correspondence of arXiv:2204.00303, and discuss examples. We conjecture that the torus-fixed points of our varieties are in bijection with two-sided cells in the finite Weyl group and prove this in types $ABC$. We relate these results to known results about Calogero-Moser spaces.</description>

      <title>Virtual invariants from the non-associative Hilbert scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non-associative model for the Hilbert scheme of points in arbitrary dimension. We define a smooth ambient space, which we call the non-associative Hilbert scheme, containing the classical nested Hilbert scheme $\mathrm{NHilb}^{\underline{d}}(\mathbb{A}^n)$ as the associativity, cut out by an explicit section of an associativity bundle. This construction yields canonical perfect obstruction theories and virtual fundamental classes on $\mathrm{NHilb}^{\underline{d}}(\mathbb{A}^n)$ for all $(n,\underline d)$. Using virtual localization, we obtain closed formulas for these virtual classes as sums over admissible nested partitions. Over the punctual locus, we rewrite these as a single multivariable iterated residue formula governing all virtual integrals. Our construction works for all $n$, produces positive-dimensional virtual classes when $n$ is large compared to the number of points, and we expect that they extend the non-commutative matrix model and virtual class construction on Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical structure of graded Betti numbers in the quadratic strand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical results, initiated by Castelnuovo and Fano and later refined by Eisenbud and Harris, provide several upper bounds on the number of quadrics defining a nondegenerate projective variety. Recently, it has been revealed that these bounds extend naturally to certain linear syzygies, suggesting the presence of a hierarchical structure governing the quadratic strand of graded Betti numbers.
  In this article, we establish such a hierarchy in full generality. We first prove sharp upper bounds for $\beta_{p,1}(X)$ depending on the degree of a projective variety $X$, extending the classical quadratic bounds to all linear syzygies and identifying the extremal varieties in each range. We then introduce geometric conditions that describe how containment of $X$ in low-degree varieties influences syzygies, and we show that these conditions stratify the quadratic strand into a finite sequence of hierarchies. This leads to a complete description of all possible extremal behavior. We also prove a generalized $K_{p,1}$-theorem, demonstrating that the vanishing of $\beta_{p,1}(X)$ detects containment in a variety of minimal degree at each hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Extending Chevalley's Theorem: A Topological Characterization of Constructibility and its Generalization Beyond Noetherian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a good map between topological spaces: a continuous map $f:X \to Y$ is *good* if for every non-empty irreducible locally closed subset $U \subseteq X$, there exists a non-empty open subset $W \subseteq Y$ such that $W \cap f(U) = W \cap \overline{f(U)} \neq \varnothing$.
  In Noetherian spaces, this condition is equivalent to preserving constructible subsets (Theorem 2.5), giving a purely topological characterization of Chevalley's theorem. Without the Noetherian assumption, the good property continues to make sense and serves as a reasonable generalization.
  We establish basic properties of good maps and introduce a weaker variant, *weak good maps*. In algebraic geometry, we prove that **every morphism locally of finite type is good** (Theorem 4.1). From this we obtain a generalization of Chevalley's theorem for morphisms locally of finite type whose underlying topological spaces are Noetherian (Theorem 4.3), and an elementary proof of Jacobson ascent (Corollary 4.4).
  The theory is developed for sober spaces and therefore applies not only to schemes but also to other geometric categories such as **adic spaces** and **perfectoid spaces**. The good property is stable under formal completion, suggesting extensions to formal and non-Archimedean geometry.</description>

Abstract: The local $h^*$-polynomial is a natural invariant of a lattice polytope appearing in Ehrhart theory and Hodge theory. In this work, we study the question posed in [GKZ94] concerning the classification of lattice simplices with vanishing local $h^*$-polynomial. Such simplices are called thin. We relate this question to linear codes and hyperplane arrangements over finite rings. This allows us to obtain a complete classification of the $4$-dimensional thin simplices, extending the previously known results in dimensions up to $3$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for Fano toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds which admit nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion. We prove a new cuplength estimate of symplectic fixed points involved in deformed spectral invariants. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Locally finitely presented Grothendieck categories with a flat generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects also has enough projectives. In this paper, we start from a key observation: a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has exact products. This enables several equivalent reformulations of the problem, allowing us to identify a counterexample (thus providing a negative solution to the problem), while also connecting it to a classical ring-theoretical question posed by Miller in 1975, and even to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Moreover, we describe several classes of Grothendieck categories where the problem can be answered affirmatively. For example, we show that a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose category of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flats if, and only if, it is generated by a family of finitely generated projectives.</description>

Abstract: Advances in AI have shown great potential in contributing to the acceleration of scientific discovery. Symbolic regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models are not necessarily derivable from established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI-Descartes, AI-Hilbert) enforce derivability from prior knowledge. However, when existing theories are incomplete or incorrect, these machine-generated hypotheses may fall outside the theoretical scope. Automatically finding corrections to axiom systems to close this gap remains a central challenge in scientific discovery. We propose a solution: an open-source algebraic geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system expressible as polynomials and a hypothesis that the axioms cannot derive, generates a minimal set of candidate axioms that, when added to the theory, provably derive the (possibly noisy) hypothesis. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach by showing that it can reconstruct key axioms required to derive the carrier-resolved photo-Hall effect, Einstein's relativistic laws, and several other laws.</description>
