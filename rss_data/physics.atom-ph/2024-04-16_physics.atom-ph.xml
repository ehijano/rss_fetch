      <title>Anisotropic polarizability of Dy at 532 nm on the intercombination transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental measurements of the dynamical polarizability of dysprosium, at a wavelength of 532 nm. We measure all three components (scalar, vector, tensor) of the anisotropic polarizability for the ground and the excited manifolds of the intercombination transition of Dy at 626 nm. The apparatus on which the measurements are performed is first presented. We obtain with this setup imaging of single Dy atoms with fidelity above 99 % and losses below 2.5 % induced by imaging. We then describe the methods used to extract the polarizability. In particular, we combine a measurement of trap frequency and trap depth on single atoms in optical tweezers, allowing us to obtain a measurement of the ground state polarizability free of errors in trap waist calibration. The obtained values give a magic condition between two Zeeman states in the ground and excited manifolds, which was used to image single atoms in optical tweezer arrays. The scalar polarizability of the ground state is in disagreement with theoretical expectations, calling for future investigations to resolve the discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Beam assisted High-Order Harmonic Generation in Semiconductor Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the context of high harmonic generation (HHG) within semiconductor crystals. Our contribution deals with the transfer and conservation of OAM in the strong-field regime, from the driving laser field to the generated harmonics. To this end, in this work, we combine the semiconductor Bloch equations with the thin slab model to simulate the generation of high-order harmonics in semiconductor media and to compute the features of the far-field harmonics. We demonstrate that this theoretical approach is capable of satisfactorily reproduce previously published experimental features of the generated harmonics in ZnO driven by a Laguerre-Gauss beam. Our research not only deepens the understanding of light-solid interactions but also heralds the dawn of bright, structured XUV coherent radiation sources with unparalleled potential across diverse technological areas, paving the way for enhanced functionalities in fields such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and optical communication.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on A Tapered Paul Trap: From Design to Potential Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a tapered Paul trap whose radio frequency electrodes are inclined to the symmetric axis of the endcap electrodes, resulting in a funnel-shaped trapping potential. With this configuration, a charged particle confined in this trap has its radial degrees of freedom coupled to that of the axial direction. The same design was successfully used to experimentally realize a single-atom heat engine, and with this setup amplification of zeptonewton forces was implemented. In this paper, we show the design, implementation, and characterization of such an ion trap in detail. This system offers a high level of control over the ion's motion. Its novel features promise applications in the field of quantum thermodynamics, quantum sensing, and quantum information.</description>
