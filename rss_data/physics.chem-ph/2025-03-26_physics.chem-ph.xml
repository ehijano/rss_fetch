      <title>Kinetics and direct imaging of electrochemically formed palladium hydride for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active and reliable electrocatalysts are fundamental to renewable energy technologies. PdCoO2 has recently been recognized as a promising catalyst template for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media thanks to the formation of active PdHx. In this article, we monitor the transformation of single PdCoO2 particles during HER, and confirm their almost complete transformation to PdHx with sub-millimeter depths and cracks throughout the particles. Using operando mass spectrometry, Co dissolution is observed under reductive potentials, leading to PdHx formation, whereas the dissolution partial current is found to be 0.1 % of the HER current. The formation of PdHx is confirmed through secondary ion mass spectrometry and quantitatively analyzed by atom probe tomography, enabled by isotope labelling of hydrogen using heavy water. Despite dry storage and high vacuum during sample preparations, an overall composition of PdD0.28 is measured for the PdHx sample, with separation between alpha- (D-poor) and beta- (D-rich) PdHx phases. The PdHx phase formed on PdCoO2 particles is stable for a wide electrochemical potential window, until Pd dissolution is observed at open circuit potentials. Our findings highlight the critical role of a templated growth method in obtaining stabilized PdHx, enabling efficient HER without the commonly slow activation processes observed in Pd. This offers insights into the design of more efficient electrocatalysts for renewable energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Oxidation States in Solids from Data-Driven Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxidation state (OS) is an essential chemical concept that embodies chemical intuition but cannot be computed with well-defined physical laws. We establish a data-driven paradigm, with its implementation as Tsinghua Oxidation States in Solids (TOSS), to explicitly compute the OSs in crystal structures as the emergent properties from large-sized datasets based on Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP). TOSS employs two looping structures over the large-sized dataset of crystal structures to obtain an emergent library of distance distributions as the foundation for chemically intuitive understanding and then determine the OSs by minimizing a loss function for each structure based on MAP and distance distributions in the whole dataset. The application of TOSS to a dataset of $\mathrm{&gt;}$1,000,000 crystal structures delivers a superior success rate, and using the resulting OSs as the dataset, we further train a data-driven alternative to TOSS based on graph convolutional networks. We expect TOSS and the ML-model-based alternative to find a wide spectrum of applications, and this work also demonstrates an encouraging example for the data-driven paradigms to explicitly compute the chemical intuition for tackling complex problems in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Intermolecular Radiative Decay: A non-local decay mechanism providing an insider's view of the solvation shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous solutions are crucial in chemistry, biology, environmental science, and technology. The chemistry of solutes is influenced by the surrounding solvation shell of water molecules, which have different chemical properties than bulk water due to their different electronic and geometric structure. It is an experimental challenge to selectively investigate this property-determining electronic and geometric structure.
  Here, we report experimental results on a novel non-local X-ray emission process, Intermolecular Radiative Decay (IRD), for the prototypical ions Na$^{+}$ and Mg$^{2+}$ in water. We show that, in IRD, an electron from the solvation shell fills a core hole in the solute, and the released energy is emitted as an X-ray photon. We analyze the underlying mechanism using theoretical calculations, and show how IRD will allow us to meet the challenge of chemically selective probing of solvation shells from within.</description>

      <title>LOCAL: A Graph-Based Active Learning Approach for Stability Analysis of DAC@NG Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual atomic catalysts supported by nitrogen-doped graphene (DAC@NG) offer significant potential in catalytic applications by overcoming intrinsic limitations associated with single atomic catalysts. However, accurately determining their stability and atomic-scale configurations remains computationally challenging due to extensive structural variability. In this study, we present the LOCalization and Active Learning (LOCAL) framework, an innovative, scalable approach employing two graph convolutional network (GCN) models (POS2COHP and Graph2E) to predict stability energies directly from initial DAC@NG structures. Leveraging an extensive dataset of 611,648 DAC@NG structures, encompassing 38 metal elements, six distinct graphene quadra-vacancy patterns, and diverse carbon/nitrogen coordination environments, LOCAL achieved a remarkable validation mean absolute error of just 0.145 eV. Utilizing this framework, we systematically analyzed stability trends across various metal pairs, successfully generating phase diagrams for experimentally validated bimetallic systems (Co-Ni, Fe-Ni, Fe-Mn, and Ag-Ni). These results underscore LOCAL's capability for rapidly evaluating structural stability, significantly accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-performance catalysts. The developed dataset and LOCAL framework are publicly available, offering a valuable resource for future catalyst design and broader exploration of catalytic materials.</description>

      <title>Towards a multi-dimensional picture of classical nucleation: The example of liquid condensation through theory and rare event sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While very popular for its ability to provide an elegant conceptual framework, classical nucleation theory (CNT) still fails at quantitatively reproducing most of the experimental and numerical observations of first order transitions. In this paper, we extend CNT by explicitly incorporating the multi-dimensional aspect of nucleation. Focusing on the liquid condensation of a Lennard-Jones gas, we used state of the art rare event sampling simulations to precisely characterize the nucleation event insisting on the specific features of the critical cluster. Our numerical results indicate a simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a 2-variable nucleation theory. Our model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties. Furthermore, our model provides a qualitatively more accurate representation of nucleation near the spinodal regime. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework highlights the limitations of CNT and more recent theories while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio simulation of excited-state potential energy surfaces with transferable deep quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate quantum chemical calculation of excited states is a challenging task, often requiring computationally demanding methods. When entire ground and excited potential energy surfaces (PESs) are desired, e.g., to predict the interaction of light excitation and structural changes, one is often forced to use cheaper computational methods at the cost of reduced accuracy. Here we introduce a novel method for the geometrically transferable optimization of neural network wave functions that leverages weight sharing and dynamical ordering of electronic states. Our method enables the efficient prediction of ground and excited-state PESs and their intersections at the highest accuracy, demonstrating up to two orders of magnitude cost reduction compared to single-point calculations. We validate our approach on three challenging excited-state PESs, including ethylene, the carbon dimer, and the methylenimmonium cation, indicating that transferable deep-learning QMC can pave the way towards highly accurate simulation of excited-state dynamics.</description>

      <title>New Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: Strong Quantum Fluctuations and Enhanced Competing Exchange Interactions Enabled by Octahedral Co2+ Ligand Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.</description>

      <title>Light's symmetry, asymmetry, and their role in nonlinear optics and ultrafast phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of symmetries is extremely useful across science. In Physics, symmetries are used to derive conservation laws and selection rules for transitions in interacting systems. In the early days of nonlinear optics (NLO), symmetries were used to formulate a set of rules for photonic processes according to the medium's symmetries that are reflected in the NLO coefficient tensor. While this approach was believed to be complete and closed, the field has recently reignited as multi-color ultrashort laser pulses with tailored polarization and spatiotemporal structures become standard in NLO. A more complete theory has been recently emerging, which aims to incorporate all possible dynamical degrees of freedom of light: spin and orbital angular momentum, spatial structure, time-dependent polarizations, temporal envelopes, etc., in addition to the symmetries of the medium. This theoretical development is also accompanied by experimental advances that rely on tailored light beams that can now be generated with ever-increasing complexity, including topologies in real and a variety of synthetic dimensions, carrying poly-chromatic carrier waves, time-dependent varying angular momenta, local-chirality, and more. The nonlinear interactions between light fields with unique symmetries (or asymmetries) and matter is especially appealing, since that holds the key for developing new ultrafast spectroscopies with sub-femtosecond resolution, for exerting exact control over matter, and improving our fundamental understanding of how light and matter interact. We review these recent advances in this expanding field, focusing on the theory, its implications, and seminal experiments. We aim to establish a comprehensive database of symmetries and selection rules governing NLO light-matter interactions within the emerging new formalism, and invite the scientific community to contribute to this effort.</description>

      <title>Kernel Learning Assisted Synthesis Condition Exploration for Ternary Spinel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and high-throughput experimentation have greatly accelerated the discovery of mixed metal oxide catalysts by leveraging their compositional flexibility. However, the lack of established synthesis routes for solid-state materials remains a significant challenge in inorganic chemistry. An interpretable machine learning model is therefore essential, as it provides insights into the key factors governing phase formation. Here, we focus on the formation of single-phase Fe$_2$(ZnCo)O$_4$, synthesized via a high-throughput co-precipitation method. We combined a kernel classification model with a novel application of global SHAP analysis to pinpoint the experimental features most critical to single phase synthesizability by interpreting the contributions of each feature. Global SHAP analysis reveals that precursor and precipitating agent contributions to single-phase spinel formation align closely with established crystal growth theories. These results not only underscore the importance of interpretable machine learning in refining synthesis protocols but also establish a framework for data-informed experimental design in inorganic synthesis.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Instabilities in Charge Transport through Molecular Nanojunctions: The Role of Nonconservative Current-Induced Electronic Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the current-induced vibrational dynamics in molecular nanojunctions is critical for gaining insight into the stability of such systems. While it is well known that Joule heating at higher bias voltages plays an important role for the stability of the nanojunction, a different mechanism caused by current-induced nonconservative forces has been reported to cause vibrational instabilities already at much lower voltages. In this paper, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to a model system for which vibrational instabilities have previously been reported. The electronic friction and other electronic forces can be calculated exactly using nonequilibrium Green's functions. We perform Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics to calculate the steady-state vibrational excitation and compare the results to a simplified eigenmode analysis, identifying the parameter regimes in which runaway modes appear.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Data Efficiency in $\Delta$-ML and Multifidelity Models for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of machine learning (ML) methods has made quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible by reducing the compute cost incurred in conventional QC methods. This has since been translated into the overhead cost of generating training data. Increased work in reducing the cost of generating training data resulted in the development of $\Delta$-ML and multifidelity machine learning methods which use data at more than one QC level of accuracy, or fidelity.
  This work compares the data costs associated with $\Delta$-ML, multifidelity machine learning (MFML), and optimized MFML (o-MFML) in contrast with a newly introduced Multifidelity$\Delta$-Machine Learning (MF$\Delta$ML) method for the prediction of ground state energies, vertical excitation energies, and the magnitude of electronic contribution of molecular dipole moments from the multifidelity benchmark dataset QeMFi. This assessment is made on the basis of training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression (KRR) case. The results indicate that the use of multifidelity methods surpasses the standard $\Delta$-ML approaches in cases of a large number of predictions. For applications which require only a few evaluations to be made using ML models, while the $\Delta$-ML method might be favored, the MF$\Delta$ML method is shown to be more efficient.</description>

      <title>Investigating Data Hierarchies in Multifidelity Machine Learning for Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in machine learning (ML) has made high-accuracy quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible. Of particular interest are multifidelity machine learning (MFML) methods where training data from differing accuracies or fidelities are used. These methods usually employ a fixed scaling factor, $\gamma$, to relate the number of training samples across different fidelities, which reflects the cost and assumed sparsity of the data. This study investigates the impact of modifying $\gamma$ on model efficiency and accuracy for the prediction of vertical excitation energies using the QeMFi benchmark dataset. Further, this work introduces QC compute time informed scaling factors, denoted as $\theta$, that vary based on QC compute times at different fidelities. A novel error metric, error contours of MFML, is proposed to provide a comprehensive view of model error contributions from each fidelity. The results indicate that high model accuracy can be achieved with just 2 training samples at the target fidelity when a larger number of samples from lower fidelities are used. This is further illustrated through a novel concept, the $\Gamma$-curve, which compares model error against the time-cost of generating training samples, demonstrating that multifidelity models can achieve high accuracy while minimizing training data costs.</description>

Abstract: Guided by perturbative analysis, we improve the accuracy of Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster theory in simple single excitations, multi-configurational single excitations, and charge transfer excitations while keeping the cost of its leading-order terms precisely in line with ground state coupled cluster. Combining these accuracy improvements with a more efficient implementation based on spin-adaptation, we observe high accuracy in a large test set of single excitations, and, in particular, a mean unsigned error for charge transfer states that outperforms equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory by 0.25 eV. We discuss how these results are achieved via a systematic identification of which amplitudes to prioritize for single- and multi-configurational excited states, and how this prioritization differs in important ways from the ground state theory. In particular, our data show that a partial linearization of the theory increases accuracy by mitigating unwanted side effects of Aufbau suppression.</description>

      <title>Long-term excitation energy transfer predicted by a modified convolutional neural networks in the FMO complexes</title>

Abstract: In machine learning (ML), the risk of recursive strategies overfitting historical data has driven the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. In this work, we propose an efficient CNNs scheme incorporating novel redundant time-functions to predict 100 picosecond (ps) excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, in which the original time $t$ is normalized by mapping it to the [0, 1] range, allowing different functions focus on distinct time intervals, thereby effectively capturing the multi-timescale characteristics of EET dynamics. This method simplifies optimization and enhances learning efficiency, and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in predicting quantum dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of Vibronic Coupling in Trapped Cold Ionic Rydberg Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.</description>

      <title>On the interplay of electronic and lattice screening on exciton binding in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.</description>

      <title>Non-stoichiometry in SnS: How it affects thin-film morphology and electrical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tin sulfide (SnS) has garnered much attention as a promising material for various applications, including solar cells and thermoelectric devices, owing to its favorable optical and electronic properties and the abundant and nontoxic nature of its constituent elements. Herein, we investigated the effect of non-stoichiometry on the morphology and electrical properties of SnS thin films. Using a unique sputtering technique with a sulfur plasma supply, SnS films with precise sulfur content control, [S]/([Sn] + [S]) (xS) ranging from 0.47 to 0.51, were fabricated. Systematic characterization revealed that non-stoichiometry on the S-rich side led to a marked increase in the carrier density of p-type conduction, which was attributed to the formation of intrinsic acceptor-type defects. In contrast, non-stoichiometry on the S-poor side hardly affects the p-type electrical properties, apparently because of the self-compensation between the intrinsic acceptor- and donor-type defects. In addition, non-stoichiometry has been identified as the cause of thin-film morphological changes, with non-stoichiometric films exhibiting rough and porous surfaces. Achieving a stoichiometric composition results in smooth and dense thin-film morphologies, which are crucial for optimizing SnS thin films for device applications. These findings underscore the importance of compositional control for tailoring the morphology and electrical behavior of SnS, paving the way for more efficient SnS-based devices.</description>

      <title>Infinite variety of thermodynamic speed limits with general activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. This unification is based on generalized means that include standard means such as the arithmetic, logarithmic, and geometric means, the first two of which respectively correspond to the dynamical activity and the dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks using different activities. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</description>
