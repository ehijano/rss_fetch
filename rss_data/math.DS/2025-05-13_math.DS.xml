      <title>A Smooth, Recurrent, Non-Periodic Viscosity Solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation were introduced by Lions and Crandall. For Tonelli Hamiltonians, these solutions are generated by the Lax-Oleinik operator. It is known that this operator converges in the autonomous framework, but this convergence fails in the general cases. In this paper, we introduce a method to construct smooth, recurrent, non-periodic viscosity solutions on fixed compact manifolds $M$ of dimension 2 or higher. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of the non-wandering set of the Lax-Oleinik operator and identify its action on various omega-limit sets.</description>

      <title>Robust computation of higher-dimensional invariant tori from individual trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for computing invariant tori of dimension greater than one. The method uses a single short trajectory of a dynamical system without any continuation or initial guesses. No preferred coordinate system is required, meaning the method is practical for physical systems where the user does not have much \textit{a priori} knowledge. Three main tools are used to obtain the rotation vector of the invariant torus: the reduced rank extrapolation method, Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimation, and a Korkine-Zolatarev lattice basis reduction. The parameterization of the torus is found via a least-squares approach. The robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated by accurately computing many two-dimensional invariant tori of a standard map example. Examples of islands and three-dimensional invariant tori are shown as well.</description>

      <title>Analytically tractable reconstruction of singular hyperbolic and quasi-strange attractors of Lorenz-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a certain three-dimensional piecewise linear system of Lorenz type in the cases of positive and negative saddle value, which is the sum of two eigenvalues of the saddle nearest to zero. This system was recently proposed and studied in \cite{belykh2019lorenz} for the case of the positive saddle value. Here we consider the main bifurcations leading to the birth of the strange attractor and provide its comparison with those of original smooth Lorenz model. For the case of a negative saddle value, we obtain an explicit forms of homoclinic and pitchfork bifurcations forming a codimension 1 cascade leading to the emergence of a quasi-strange attractor. This cascade reproduces a typical bifurcation route towards the birth of a quasi-strange attractor in smooth Lorenz-like systems with the negative saddle value. We support our analytical result with a numerical comparison with the Lorenz-Lyubimov-Zaks system.</description>

      <title>Interaction anomalies and one-particle dynamics in very special relativity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that relativistic invariance introduce strong constraints in the interactions of classical particles. We generalize the non-interaction theorems for Lorentz violating systems which still preserve a subgroup of Poincar\'e symmetry. In particular we analize the case of very special relativity introduced by Cohen and Glashow. We also extend the analysis for Galilei invariant multiparticle systems and for some anisotropic systems which are still invariant under some maximal subgroups of Galilei group.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical defect measures of magnetic Laplacians on hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a closed hyperbolic surface, we investigate semiclassical defect measures associated with the magnetic Laplacian in the presence of a constant magnetic field. Depending on the energy level where the eigenfunctions concentrate, three distinct dynamical regimes emerge. In the low-energy regime, we show that any invariant measure of the magnetic flow in phase space can be obtained as a semiclassical measure. At the critical energy level, we establish Quantum Unique Ergodicity, together with a quantitative rate of convergence of eigenfunctions to the Liouville measure. In the high-energy regime, we prove a Shnirelman-type result: a density-one subsequence of eigenfunctions becomes equidistributed with respect to the Liouville measure.</description>

      <title>Continuous Temporal Learning of Probability Distributions via Neural ODEs with Applications in Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the continuous--time dynamics of probability distributions from time--dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The aim is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, evolves over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture how samples from a continuous-time stochastic process evolve over the time. To model potential distribution shifts over time, we introduce a time-dependent function parameterized by a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) and estimate it non--parametrically using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The proposed model is highly interpretable, detects subtle temporal shifts, and remains computationally efficient. Through simulation studies, we show that it performs competitively in terms of estimation accuracy against state-of-the-art, less interpretable methods such as normalized gradient--flows and non--parameteric kernel density estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method on digital clinical--trial data, showing how the interventions alters the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels and enabling a rigorous comparison of control and treatment groups from novel mathematical and clinical perspectives.</description>

      <title>On the Spectra of Sieved Schr\"odinger Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a family of examples of discrete Schr\"odinger operators whose spectral dimension is not invariant under sieving. The examples are produced from the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, which is one of the main models of a one-dimensional quasicrystal. We also give a family of examples in which the local Hausdorff dimension tends to zero in some parts of the spectrum as the sieving parameter is sent to infinity.</description>

      <title>Fast-Slow Neural Networks for Learning Singularly Perturbed Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singularly perturbed dynamical systems play a crucial role in climate dynamics and plasma physics. A powerful and well-known tool to address these systems is the Fenichel normal form, which significantly simplifies fast dynamics near slow manifolds through a transformation. However, this normal form is difficult to realize in conventional numerical algorithms. In this work, we explore an alternative way of realizing it through structure-preserving machine learning. Specifically, a fast-slow neural network (FSNN) is proposed for learning data-driven models of singularly perturbed dynamical systems with dissipative fast timescale dynamics. Our method enforces the existence of a trainable, attracting invariant slow manifold as a hard constraint. Closed-form representation of the slow manifold enables efficient integration on the slow time scale and significantly improves prediction accuracy beyond the training data. We demonstrate the FSNN on examples including the Grad moment system, two-scale Lorenz96 equations, and Abraham-Lorentz dynamics modeling radiation reaction of electrons.</description>

      <title>Contraction and concentration of measures with applications to theoretical neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of probability measures associated with stochastic dynamical systems featuring either globally contracting or $B_{r}$-contracting drift terms. While classical results often assume constant diffusion and gradient-based drifts, we extend the analysis to spatially inhomogeneous diffusion and non-integrable vector fields. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of stationary measures under global contraction, showing that convergence is preserved when the contraction rate dominates diffusion inhomogeneity. For systems contracting only outside of a compact set and with constant diffusion, we demonstrate mass concentration near the minima of an associated non-convex potential, like in multistable regimes. The theoretical findings are illustrated through Hopfield networks, highlighting implications for memory retrieval dynamics in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>A study of braids arising from simple choreographies of the planar Newtonian N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions of the planar Newtonian $N$-body problem with equal masses. Each periodic solution traces out a braid with $N$ strands in 3-dimensional space. When the braid is of pseudo-Anosov type, it has an associated stretch factor greater than 1, which reflects the complexity of the corresponding periodic solution. For each $N \ge 3$, Guowei Yu established the existence of a family of simple choreographies to the planar Newtonian $N$-body problem. We prove that braids arising from Yu's periodic solutions are of pseudo-Anosov types, except in the special case where all particles move along a circle. We also identify the simple choreographies whose braid types have the largest and smallest stretch factors, respectively.</description>

      <title>New insights into population dynamics from the continuous McKendrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article covers the continuous McKendrick model, which is key in epidemiology and population dynamics, developed by Anderson Gray McKendrick. It describes population age structure changes via birth and death rates as continuous functions, shedding light on population dynamics through differential equations. The article delves into the equations, boundary conditions, and survival rates, offering insights into disease progression and population dynamics. It aims for an asymptotic analysis of population dynamics using previous studies and illustrative examples. The main finding is that the population nears extinction only if the expected offspring per individual ($R$) is less than 1.</description>
