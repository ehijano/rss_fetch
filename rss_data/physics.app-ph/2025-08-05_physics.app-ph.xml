      <title>High-magnitude, spatially variable, and sustained strain engineering of 2D semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors often combine high elasticity and in-plane strength, making them ideal for strain-induced tuning of electronic characteristics, akin to strategies used in silicon electronics. However, current techniques fall short in achieving high-magnitude (&gt;1%), spatially resolved, and stable strain in these materials. Here, we apply biaxial tensile strain up to 2.2%, with +/-0.12% resolution over micrometre-scale regions in monolayer MoS2 via conformal transfer onto patterned substrates fabricated using two-photon lithography. The induced strain is stable for months and enables local band gap tuning of ~0.4 eV in monolayer MoS2, ~25% of its intrinsic band gap. This represents a distinct demonstration of simultaneous high-magnitude, spatially resolved, and sustained strain in 2D monolayers. We further extend the approach to bilayer WS2-MoS2 heterostructures. This strain-engineering technique opens a new regime of strain-enabled control in 2D semiconductors to support the development of wide-spectrum optoelectronic devices and nanoelectronics with engineered electronic landscapes.</description>

      <title>Large-Area Photonic Membranes Achieving Uniform and Strong Enhancement of Photoluminescence and Second-Harmonic Generation in Monolayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01118v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong excitonic responses, direct bandgaps, and remarkable nonlinear optical properties, making them highly attractive for integrated photonic, optoelectronic, and quantum applications. Here, we present a large area freestanding membrane photonic platform that achieves exceptional enhancement of light matter interactions in monolayer WSe2 via quasi bound states in the continuum. The freestanding architecture effectively suppresses radiative losses and supports high Q optical resonances, leading to enhanced light matter interactions. This results in significant photoluminescence emission and second harmonic generation enhancement factors of 1158 and 378, respectively, with spatial uniformity sustained across a 450 times 450 um2 area. This uniform SHG enhancement further enables polarization resolved mapping of crystal orientation and grain boundaries, offering a practical method for large area structural characterization of 2D materials. Moreover, femtosecond pumped SHG spectra reveal multiple narrowband peaks originating from distinct quasi BIC modes providing direct spectral evidence of resonantly enhanced nonlinear coupling. The combined attributes of strong optical enhancement, spectral selectivity, and wafer scale compatibility establish this platform as a scalable interface for 2D semiconductor integration in next generation optoelectronic, nonlinear, and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Erbium-Doped Fibre Quantum Memory for Chip-Integrated Quantum-Dot Single Photons at 980 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of long-distance quantum communication and the envisioned quantum internet relies on coherent hybrid light-matter interfaces connecting quantum light emitters with quantum memory (QM) systems. Unlike probabilistic photon pair sources such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, deterministic quantum light emitters enable the on-demand production of pure and bright single and entangled photons, essential for scalable quantum networks. In this work, we present the first experimental realization of a coherent hybrid light-matter interface between a chip-integrated InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot (QD) and a solid-state QM based on Er$^{3+}$ ions doped in a glass silica fiber (erbium-doped fiber, EDF). The emission spectrum of the InAsP/InP nanowire QD aligns with the absorption bandwidth of the EDF at 980 nm at cryogenic temperatures, allowing efficient interaction between the two systems. To demonstrate this, we present a spectroscopic characterization of the $^{4}I_{15/2} \leftrightarrow ^{4}I_{11/2}$ optical transition in EDF at 980 nm. Our measurements reveal substantial inhomogeneous broadening of this optical transition and a long spin population lifetime, underscoring EDFs potential for broadband QM implementation. We implement an 8 GHz bandwidth multimode QM based on the Atomic Frequency Comb protocol, enabling the storage and retrieval of 59 weak coherent pulses. Furthermore, we characterize single-photon emission from an InAsP/InP nanowire QD at 980 nm and demonstrate its deterministic storage and recall in the EDF QM. Notably, this is achieved without spectral tuning of the QD emission, demonstrating its direct compatibility with a solid-state QM.</description>

      <title>Sub 10 nm Nanochannels Enable Directional Quasi Ballistic Exciton Transport over 5 {\mu}m at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale potential wells provide a powerful means to engineer energy landscapes in low dimensional materials, enabling control over quantum states, carrier dynamics, and optoelectronic responses. Such confinement governs phenomena including charge localization, transport anisotropy, band structure modulation, and light matter interaction strength. However, realizing clean and well defined nanostructures remains technically challenging, as fabrication techniques such as focused ion beam (FIB) milling and electron beam lithography frequently introduce structural disorder, residual contamination, or detrimental interactions with the underlying substrate. Here, we develop a femtosecond laser direct writing technique to create sub 10 nm wide dielectric nanochannels with smooth, continuous boundaries on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, without using resists or chemical etchants. As a demonstration, these nanochannels are employed to define programmable dielectric landscapes in monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), forming excitonic energy funnels that suppress scattering and significantly extend the exciton transport distance. Transport is reshaped from isotropic diffusion with submicron range to directional super diffusion exhibiting quasi ballistic transport exceeding 5 um, more than 20 times longer than in unpatterned systems. The smooth dielectric boundaries further enable precise control over exciton trajectories, allowing for programmable transport pathways. This dry, scalable, and substrate compatible approach offers a robust platform for exciton engineering and integrated quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>A Novel Methodology of Visualizing Orthorhombic Phase Uniformity in Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Devices Using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films are promising for next-generation memory and logic devices due to their CMOS compatibility and scalability. The spatial uniformity of the orthorhombic (O) phase is crucial for optimizing ferroelectric properties like remnant polarization. This work introduces a novel piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) approach for 2D mapping of O-phase uniformity in HZO films (5 nm, 9 nm, and 20 nm), further quantifing O-phase distribution by distinguishing polarized O-phase regions from non-polarized tetragonal/monoclinic (T/M) phases. Our results reveal that the 9 nm film exhibits the most uniform O-phase and highest remnant polarization. This PFM-based method enables comprehensive phase characterization without requiring complicated facilities, broadening access to phase analysis and advancing ferroelectric thin-film research for memory and logic applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical Multiport-Network Modeling and Efficient Discrete Optimization of RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter fills the research gap on physics-consistent optimization for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with mutual coupling (MC) and 1-bit-tunable elements, a common hardware constraint in existing RIS prototypes. We compare a model-based method (temperature-annealed back-propagation) and model-agnostic methods (coordinate descent, genetic algorithm), and evaluate potential benefits of intelligently initializing these methods. To facilitate our evaluation, we introduce a technique for generating statistical ensembles of multiport-network model parameters, wherein a single hyper-parameter adjusts the MC strength. The technique is a generalization of Rayleigh fading to radio environments with deterministic programmability, and it accounts for passivity constraints as well as the coherent-backscattering effect. We find that, except when MC is negligible, coordinate descent with random initialization yields the most favorable trade-off in terms of performance, execution time and memory usage. We expect our findings to extend to beyond-diagonal RIS, stacked intelligent metasurfaces, dynamic metasurface antennas, and wave-domain physical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Lithium Niobate Nonlinear Photonic Circuits for Low-Crosstalk and Broadband All Optical Wavelength Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All optical wavelength converters (AOWCs) that can effectively and flexibly switch optical signals between different wavelength channels are essential elements in future optical fiber communications and quantum information systems. A promising strategy for achieving high-performance AOWCs is to leverage strong three-wave mixing processes in second-order nonlinear nanophotonic devices, specifically thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate (TF-PPLN) waveguides. By exploiting the advantages of sub-wavelength light confinement and dispersion engineering compared with their bulk counterparts, TF-PPLN waveguides provide a viable route for realizing highly efficient and broadband wavelength conversion. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely on a single TF-PPLN device to perform both frequency doubling of the telecom pump and the wavelength conversion process, resulting in significant crosstalk between adjacent signal channels. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating a two-stage TF-PPLN nonlinear photonic circuit that integrates a second-harmonic generation module, a signal wavelength conversion module, and multiple adiabatic directional coupler-based pump filters, on a single chip. By decoupling the two nonlinear processes and leveraging the high pump-filtering extinction ratio, we achieve low-crosstalk AOWC with a side-channel suppression ratio exceeding 25 dB, substantially surpassing the performance of single-stage devices. Furthermore, our device exhibits an ultra-broad conversion bandwidth of 110 nm and a relatively high conversion efficiency of -15.6 dB, making it an attractive solution for future photonic systems. The two-stage AOWC design shows promise for low-noise phase-sensitive amplification and quantum frequency conversion in future classical and quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Weak Turbulence of Phonon and Magnon Beams in Magneto-Acoustic Ultrathin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a simple theoretical model describing narrow envelope surface acoustic waves
  (phonons) and spin waves (magnons) in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film. Based on the general
  principles of weak wave turbulence, the model considers interactions between beams of an ideal
  phonon gas and a weakly non-ideal magnon gas, which represent magnetoacoustic oscillations in
  the system. Equations for the wave envelopes of phonons and magnons, along with their harmonics,
  are derived, incorporating nonlinear effects from three- and four-particle interactions. In
  the general non-resonant case, linear stationary envelope simulations are sufficient. These clarify
  the experimentally observed angular dependence of the transmitted acoustic signal with respect
  to the orientation of the magnetic field. The study highlights increased energy losses associated
  with enhanced magnetoacoustic coupling. Given the broad interdisciplinary interest in weak turbulence
  phenomena within condensed matter physics and nonlinear wave dynamics, our model
  offers significant predictive capabilities and greatly simplifies calculations of quasiparticle beam
  interactions.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Denoising-Based in Vivo Fluorescence Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 900-1,880 nm) has been pivotal in advancing in vivo fluorescence imaging due to its superior penetration depth and contrast. Yet, its clinical utility remains limited by insufficient imaging temporal-spatial resolution and the absence of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NIR-II contrast agents. This work presents a frequency-domain denoising (FDD)-based in vivo fluorescence imaging technique, which can improve signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 2,500-fold and 300-fold, respectively. The great enhancement yields a doubled penetration depth and a 95% reduction in contrast agent dosage or excitation light intensity for mouse vascular imaging. Additionally, we achieved a SBR far exceeded the Rose criterion in the observation of tumor margins and vessels in mice using Indocyanine Green (ICG), demonstrating the feasibility of NIR-II surgical navigation with FDA-approved agents. Furthermore, a 600 Hz real-time video enables visualization of the entire contrast agent diffusion process within the mouse body and differentiation between arteries and veins. This innovative technique, characterized by exceptional sensitivity, efficiency, and robustness, presents a promising solution for clinical applications, particularly in NIR-II surgical navigation.</description>

      <title>A kilometer photonic link connecting superconducting circuits in two dilution refrigerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a leading platform for implementing practical quantum computation algorithms. Although superconducting quantum processors with hundreds of qubits have been demonstrated, their further scaling up is constrained by the physical size and cooling power of dilution refrigerators. This constraint can be overcome by constructing a quantum network to interconnect qubits hosted in different refrigerators, which requires microwave-to-optical transducers to enable low-loss signal transmission over long distances. Despite that various designs and demonstrations have achieved high-efficiency and low-added-noise transducers, a coherent photonic link between separate refrigerators has not yet been realized. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate coherent signal transfer between two superconducting circuits housed in separate dilution refrigerators, enabled by a pair of frequency-matched aluminum nitride electro-optic transducers connected via a 1-km telecom optical fiber. With transducers at each node achieving &gt;0.1% efficiency, an overall 80 dB improvement in transduction efficiency over commercial electro-optic modulators is attainable, paving the way towards a fully quantum-enabled link. This work provides critical design guidelines towards scalable superconducting quantum networks interconnected by photonic links.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Epsilon-WO3 Nanoparticles and Its Bipolaron Driven Opto-electronic Properties at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unique polymorph of binary tungsten trioxide, the epsilon phase of WO3, has non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric structure, typically stable below -43 degree C in bulk. We have stabilized the epsilon-WO3 at room temperature (RT) and nanostructured powders via flame spray pyrolysis synthesis. These nanopowders are drop cast into uniform thin films to enable RT measurement of ferroelectric and optoelectronic properties. We report ferroelectric hysteresis, nanoscale domains, and dipole switching measured via Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM). The epsilon-WO3 films also display optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and anticlockwise ferroelectric butterfly capacitance versus voltage hysteresis, further demonstrating the ferroelectric nature of epsilon-WO3. Remarkably, epsilon-WO3 shows ferroelectric polarization responses to optical stimuli and form bipolaron at RT, a spin-zero quasiparticle previously found only in cryogenic temperatures. The bipolaron formation and its interaction with electro-optical stimuli results in a single layer solid-state blue coloration, a ferrochromic effect. A mechanism of the ferrochromic effect is discussed. In summary, epsilon-WO3 appears to be a ferroelectric with the simplest structure, forming bosonic spin-zero bipolaron at RT, and it's dipoles respond to opto-electrical signals; therefore, this material holds significant promise for transforming the field of optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Tunable Terahertz Detection and Generation using FETs operating in the saturation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I report on the experimental observation of DC instability and self-amplification through stimulated emission of 0.2 and 1.63 THz radiation using InGaAs/GaAs HEMT operating in the deep saturation regime at room temperature. I demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally, that the Sub-THz and THz response of FETs are attributable to the rectification of the nonlinear dependence of the device's current-voltage characteristics. FETs function as nonlinear THz mixers and rectifiers, with their open-drain responsivity described by an expression analogous to that of a zero-bias Schottky diode detector. However, operating FETs in the deep saturation regime permits precise tuning of the device to the quantum localized resonance condition and the negative resistance mode at room temperature. Consequently, FETs can be adjusted in the deep saturation regime to facilitate tunable sub-THz and THz detection and generation as well as tunable sub-THz and THz lasing effect. These results are anticipated to significantly impact technological advancements across various fields in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric phases provide a unified framework for understanding diverse phenomena in quantum and classical physics. The Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phase, arising from variation of optical transverse polarization, has transformed light manipulation. However, this phase has never been observed in sound waves due to their curl-free longitudinal nature. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the PB phase can emerge in general inhomogeneous sound waves with polarization evolution of velocity field. Using surface sound waves as an example, we uncover the intriguing Janus property of the PB phase arising from spin-momentum locking, and realize acoustic PB metasurfaces for versatile wavefront manipulation. We further extend the mechanism to free-space structured sound and realize acoustic $q$-plate for generating acoustic vortices through spin-orbit interaction. Our work provides new insights into sound wave properties and enables the manipulation of inhomogeneous acoustic fields via the PB phase, with potential applications in acoustic communications and imaging.</description>

Abstract: Single-shot picosecond (ps) laser induced delamination allows for the direct generation of suspended membranes from a continuous metallic film, offering a promising platform for control of ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by acoustic waves. Using the picosecond-ultrasonics method, we demonstrate that long-lived low-frequency acoustic waves can be optically-excited in the delaminated cavities. At the same time, higher-frequency modes &gt;60GHz exhibit a surprisingly fast damping, following a scaling law incompatible with the expected attenuation mediated by phonon-phonon scattering. Comparing measurements between delaminated cavities and a benchmark nickel film in contact with the substrate, we link our findings with structural modifications of the nickel crystal induced by the delamination process.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals and advances in transverse thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling/heating within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role to discuss their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.</description>

      <title>Post-compression of a Q-switched laser in a glass-rod multi-pass cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-switched lasers are compact, cost-effective, and highly pulse energy-scalable sources for nanosecond-scale laser pulses. The technology has been developed for many decades and is widely used in scientific, industrial and medical applications. However, their inherently narrow bandwidth imposes a lower limit on pulse duration - typically in the few-hundred-picosecond range - limiting the applicability of Q-switched technology in fields that require ultrafast laser pulses in the few-picosecond or femtosecond regime. In contrast, mode-locked lasers can produce broad-band, ultrafast (&lt; 1 ps) pulses, but are complex, expensive, and typically require a large footprint. To bridge the parameter gap between these two laser platforms - in terms of pulse duration and achievable peak power - we here propose a Herriott-type multi-pass cell (MPC) based post-compression scheme for shortening the pulse durations of Q-switched lasers down to the ultrafast, picosecond regime. We experimentally demonstrate post-compression of 0.5 ns, 1 mJ pulses from a Q-switched laser to 24 ps using a compact glass-rod MPC for spectral broadening. We verify this result numerically and show that compression down to a few picoseconds is possible using the nanosecond MPC (nMPC).</description>
