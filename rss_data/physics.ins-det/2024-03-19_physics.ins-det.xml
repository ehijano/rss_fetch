      <title>A Laser Phase Plate for Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low image contrast is a major limitation in transmission electron microscopy, since samples with low atomic number only weakly phase-modulate the illuminating electron beam, and beam-induced sample damage limits the usable electron dose. The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's phase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that applies a $\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has passed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed in or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image aberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when the electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material. 
  In this thesis, I present the theory, design, and implementation of the laser phase plate, which instead uses a focused continuous-wave laser beam to phase shift the electron beam. A near-concentric Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity focuses and resonantly enhances the power of the laser beam in order to achieve the high intensity required to provide the phase shift. We demonstrate that the cavity can surpass this requirement and generate a record-high continuous-wave laser intensity of $590 \, \mathrm{GW}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. By integrating the cavity into a transmission electron microscope, we show that the ponderomotive potential of the laser beam applies a spatially selective phase shift to the electron beam. This enables us to make the first experimental observation of the relativistic reversal of the ponderomotive potential. 
  We then theoretically analyze the properties of the contrast transfer function generated by the laser phase plate. We experimentally determine that resolution loss caused by thermal magnetic field noise emanating from electrically conductive materials in the cavity can be eliminated by designing the cavity with a sufficiently large electron beam aperture. Finally, we show that the laser phase plate provides a stable $\pi/2$ phase shift and concomitant contrast enhancement when imaging frozen hydrated biological macromolecules. We use these images to successfully determine the structure of the molecules. This demonstrates the laser phase plate as the first stable and lossless phase plate for transmission electron microscopy</description>

      <title>Development of neutron beamline for laser-driven neutron resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress of laser science provides laser-driven neutron source (LDNS), which has remarkable features such as the short pulse width. One of the key techniques to be developed for more efficient use of the LDNS is neutron collimation tubes to increase the number of neutrons arriving at a detector in the time-of-flight method. However, when a tube with a thick wall is used as a collimator the neutron collection efficiency at the detector increases but the time resolution becomes wider because of multiple scattering inside of the tube. In the present study, we have developed a collimation tube made of Ni-0, which is optimized for the increased neutron collection efficiency and a reasonable time resolution. This collimator has been demonstrated experimentally using neutron resonance spectroscopy with neutrons provided from LFEX laser.</description>

      <title>Integrating lpGBT links into the Common Readout Units (CRU) of the ALICE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ALICE read-out and trigger system, the present GBT and CRU based solution will also serve for Run4 without major modifications. By now, the GBT protocol has been superseded by lpGBT. Extensions of the ALICE system (e.g. the planned FoCal and ITS3 detector) will therefore require to use lpGBT while keeping the compatibility with the existing system. In this paper we show the implementation and testing of a possible integration of the lpGBT-FPGA IP into the CRU firmware, allowing the extension of the present system, keeping it more versatile and future-proof.</description>

      <title>Development of a low-background micro pixel chamber for directional dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can provide strong evidence of their existence and the directional method would have an advantage over other methods to detect the clear signal of WIMPs. Time projection chambers with micro-patterned gaseous detectors (MPGDs) are one of the common devices used in directional WIMP searches. A micro pixel chamber ({\mu}-PIC), one of the various types of MPGDs, with specially selected low background materials (LBG{\mu}-PIC) was developed and its performance was studied. The radon emission of the LBG{\mu}-PIC was less than 1/60 of that of the {\mu}-PIC currently in use. Although a non-negligible gain non- homogeneity was seen for the LBG{\mu}-PIC, it can be used for the directional WIMP search with the correction of the non-homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Force metrology with plane parallel plates: Final design review and outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the past few decades, abundant evidence for physics beyond the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology was found. Yet, we are tapping into the dark regarding our understanding of the dark sector. For more than a century, open problems related to the nature of the vacuum remain unresolved. Besides the traditional high-energy frontier and cosmology, technological advancement provides complementary access to new physics via high-precision experiments. Among the latter, the Casimir And Non-Newtonian force EXperiment (\cannex{}) has successfully completed its proof-of-principle phase and will soon commence operation. Benefiting from its plane parallel plate geometry, both interfacial and gravity-like forces are maximized, leading to increased sensitivity. A wide range of dark sector forces, Casimir forces in and out of thermal equilibrium, and gravity will be tested. This article describes the final experimental design, its sensitivity, and expected results.</description>

      <title>Wavelength modulation laser-induced fluorescence for plasma characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy is an essential tool for probing ion and atom velocity distribution functions (VDFs) in complex plasmas. VDFs carry information about kinetic properties of the species critical for plasma characterization, yet their accurate interpretation is challenging due to multicomponent distributions, broadening effects, and background emissions. Our research introduces wavelength modulation (WM) LIF as a solution to enhance VDF sensitivity measurements. WM-LIF, unlike standard amplitude modulation (AM) methods, measures the derivative of the LIF signal, providing greater sensitivity to changes in VDF shape. A numerical model was developed to compare the efficacy of WM and AM signals in lock-in amplifier-based measurements. Experiments were conducted in a weakly collisional argon plasma with magnetized electrons and non-magnetized ions. The argon ion VDFs were measured using a narrow-band tunable diode laser, with its wavelength scanned across the Ar ion transition 4p^4 D_(7/2)-3d^4 F_(9/2) centered at 664.553 nm (in vacuum). A lock-in amplifier detected the second harmonic WM signal, generated by modulating the laser wavelength with an externally controlled piezo-driven mirror. Our findings indicate that WM-LIF can be used to determine VDF parameters, such as distribution components and their temperatures and velocities, serving as an independent method of obtaining such parameters, which can be used for improving analysis of conventional AM approach. This method is especially beneficial in environments with substantial light noise or background emissions e.g., thermionic cathodes and reflective surfaces.</description>

      <title>Smart structural health monitoring (SHM) system for on-board localization of defects in pipes using torsional ultrasonic guided waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most reported research for monitoring health of pipelines using ultrasonic guided waves (GW) typically utilize bulky piezoelectric transducer rings and laboratory-grade ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT) equipment. Consequently, the translation of these approaches from laboratory settings to field-deployable systems for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) becomes challenging. In this work, we present an innovative algorithm for damage identification and localization in pipes, implemented on a compact FPGA-based smart GW-SHM system. The custom-designed board, featuring a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and front-end electronics, is capable of actuating the PZT thickness shear mode transducers, data acquisition and recording from PZT sensors and generating a damage index (DI) map for localizing the damage on the structure. The algorithm is a variation of the common source method adapted for cylindrical geometry. The utility of the algorithm is demonstrated for detection and localization of defects such as notch and mass loading on a steel pipe, through extensive finite element (FE) method simulations. Experimental results obtained using a C-clamp for applying mass loading on the pipe show good agreement with the FE simulations. The localization error values for experimental data analyzed using C code on a processor implemented on the FPGA are consistent with algorithm results generated on a computer running MATLAB code. The system presented in this study is suitable for a wide range of GW-SHM applications, especially in cost-sensitive scenarios that benefit from on-node signal processing over cloud-based solutions.</description>

      <title>An efficient biosensor based on magnetoelastic waves for detection of antibodies in human plasma for COVID-19 serodiagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study proposes a new efficient wireless biosensor based on magnetoelastic waves for the detection of antibodies in human plasma, aiming at the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. The biosensor was functionalized with the N antigen - nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Validation analyses, by sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro-Raman spectroscopy, confirmed the selectivity and effective surface functionalization of the biosensor. The research successfully obtained, expressed and purified the recombinant antigen, while plasma samples from COVID-19 positive and negative patients were used to test the performance of the biosensor. A comparison of performance with the ELISA method revealed equivalent diagnostic power. These results indicate the robustness of the biosensor in reliably differentiating between positive and negative samples, highlighting its potential as an efficient and low-cost tool for the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition to being fast to execute and having the potential for automation in large-scale diagnostic studies, the biosensor fills a significant gap in existing SARS-CoV-2 detection approaches.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Pad-Sensor Based Prototype of the Silicon Tungsten Electromagnetic Calorimeter for the Forward Direction in ALICE at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constructed a large-scale electromagnetic calorimeter prototype as a part of the Forward Calorimeter upgrade project (FoCal) for the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The prototype, also known as ``Mini FoCal'', consists of 20 layers of silicon pad sensors and tungsten alloy plates with printed circuit boards and readout electronics. The constructed detector was tested at the test beam facility of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. We obtain an energy resolution of about 4.3% for electron beams at both 150 and 250 GeV/$c$, which is consistent with realistic detector response simulations. Longitudinal profiles of electromagnetic shower were also measured and found to agree with the simulations. The same prototype detector was installed in the ALICE experimental area about 7.5m away from the interaction point. It was used to measure inclusive electromagnetic cluster energy distributions and neutral-pion candidate invariant mass distributions for pseudo-rapidity of $\eta$=3.7-4.5 in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at LHC. The measured distributions in different $\eta$ regions are similar to those obtained from PYTHIA simulations.</description>

      <title>Pixel detector hybridization and integration with anisotropic conductive adhesives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reliable and cost-effective interconnect technology is required for the development of hybrid pixel detectors. The interconnect technology needs to be adapted for the pitch and die sizes of the respective applications. For small-scale applications and during the ASIC and sensor development phase, interconnect technologies must also be suitable for the assembly of single-dies typically available from Multi-Project-Wafer submissions. Within the CERN EP R&amp;D program and the AIDAinnova collaboration, innovative and scalable hybridization concepts are under development for pixel-detector applications in future colliders. This contribution presents recent results of a newly developed in-house single-die interconnection process based on Anisotropic Conductive Adhesives (ACA). The ACA interconnect technology replaces solder bumps with conductive micro-particles embedded in an epoxy layer applied as either film or paste. The electro-mechanical connection between the sensor and ASIC is achieved via thermocompression of the ACA using a flip-chip device bonder. A specific pixel-pad topology is required to enable the connection via micro-particles and create cavities into which excess epoxy can flow. This pixel-pad topology is achieved with an in-house Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold process that is also under development within the project. The ENIG and ACA processes are qualified with a variety of different ASICs, sensors, and dedicated test structures, with pad diameters ranging from 12 {\mu}m to 140 {\mu}m and pitches between 20 {\mu}m and 1.3 mm. The produced assemblies are characterized electrically, with radioactive-source exposures, and in tests with high-momentum particle beams. A focus is placed on recent optimization of the plating and interconnect processes, resulting in an improved plating uniformity and interconnect yield.</description>

      <title>Multi-Blade detector with VMM3a-ASIC-based readout: installation and commissioning at the reflectometer Amor at PSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Multi-Blade (MB) Boron-10-based neutron detector is the chosen technology for three instruments at the European Spallation Source (ESS): the two ESS reflectometers, ESTIA and FREIA, and the Test Beam Line. A fourth MB detector has been built, installed and commissioned for the user operation of the reflectometer Amor at PSI (Switzerland). Amor can be considered a downscaled version of the ESS reflectometer ESTIA. They are based on the same Selene guide concept, optimized for performing focusing reflectometry on small samples. The experience gained at Amor is invaluable for the future deployment of the MB detector at the ESS. This manuscript describes the MB detector construction and installation at Amor along with the readout electronics chain based on the VMM3a ASIC. The readout chain deployed at Amor is equivalent of that of the ESS, including the readout master module (RMM), event-formation-units (EFUs), Kafka, FileWriter and live visualisation tools.</description>

      <title>First-principle event reconstruction by time-charge readouts for the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a liquid-scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure the reference reactor neutrino spectrum with sub-percent energy resolution. We use inhomogeous Poisson process and Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM) to calibrate the detector response and the charge distribution of a SiPM. We develop a pure probabilistic method using time and charge of SiPMs from first principles to reconstruct point-like events in the TAO central detector. Thanks to our precise model and the high photo-coverage and quantum efficiency of the SiPM tiles at TAO, we achieve a vertex position resolution better than 16 mm and an energy resolution of about 2% at 1 MeV, marking the world's best performance of liquid scintillator detectors. Our methodology is applicable to other experiments that utilize PMTs for time and charge readouts.</description>
