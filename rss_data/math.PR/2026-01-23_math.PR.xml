      <title>Discrete log-concavity and threshold phenomena for atomic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate threshold phenomena for random polytopes $K_N=\conv\{X_1,\dots,X_N\}$ generated by i.i.d.\ samples from an atomic law $\mu$. We identify and provide a missing justification in the discrete-hypercube threshold argument of Dyer--F\"uredi--McDiarmid, where the supporting half-space estimate is derived via a smooth (gradient/uniqueness) step that can fail at boundary contact points. We then compare threshold-driving mechanisms in the continuous log-concave setting -- through the Cram\'{e}r transform and Tukey's half-space depth -- with their discrete analogues. Within this framework, we establish a sharp threshold for lattice $p$-balls $\mathbb{Z}^n \cap rB_p^n$. Finally, we present structural counterexamples showing that sharp thresholds need not hold in general discrete log-concave settings.</description>

      <title>Variance bounds in product measures without exponential tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish analogs of Cheeger's inequality for probability measures with heavy tails. As one of the principal applications, suppose $\lambda &gt; 3$ and define the (Pareto) probability measure $\mu_{\lambda}$ on $[1,\infty)$ by $d\mu_{\lambda}(x) = (\lambda - 1) x^{-\lambda}$. Let $\mu_{\lambda}^n$ denote the product measure of $\mu_{\lambda}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then, for any $1$-Lipschitz function (with respect to the Euclidean distance) $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, we obtain the variance bound $\operatorname{Var}_{\mu_{\lambda}^n}(f) \le C(\lambda)\, n^{\frac{2}{\lambda - 1}}$, where $C(\lambda)$ is an explicit constant depending only on $\lambda$. This improves upon the existing bound $\operatorname{Var}_{\mu_{\lambda}^n}(f) = O(n)$ derived from the Efron--Stein inequality. Moreover, this bound is asymptotically tight when considering the $1$-Lipschitz function $f(x) = |x|_{\infty}$ corresponding to the $L^{\infty}$ norm. In probabilistic terms, suppose $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are i.i.d.\ random variables with distribution $\mu_{\lambda}$. Then, for any $1$-Lipschitz function $f$, we have $\operatorname{Var}(f(X_1, \dots, X_n)) \le C'(\lambda)\operatorname{Var}(\max\{X_1, \dots, X_n\}) = \Theta\!\left(n^{\frac{2}{\lambda - 1}}\right)$, where $C'(\lambda)$ is another explicit constant depending only on $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Colour ratio in Prim's ranking of bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a complete bipartite graph of size $n$ endowed with i.i.d. uniform edge weights and run Prim's Algorithm to obtain a ranking of its vertices. Let $\rho^{(n)}_k$ be the proportion of black vertices among the first $k$ vertices in this ranking. We characterise the limit behaviour of $\rho^{(n)}_k$ as both $n$ and $k$ tend to infinity. Our results show that in general the limit of $\rho^{(n)}_k$, when existing, differs from the overall proportion of the black vertices in the graph.</description>

      <title>The Frog Model on $\mathbb{Z}$ with Discrete Weibull Lifetimes and Random Parameter $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the frog model on $\mathbb{Z}$ with particle wise discrete Weibull lifetimes. Each particle has an i.i.d. survival parameter $\pi\in(0,1)$; conditionally on $\pi=p$, its lifetime $\Xi$ satisfies \[ P(\Xi\ge k\mid \pi=p)=p^{k^{\gamma}},\qquad k\in\mathbb{N}_0,\gamma&gt;0. \] The law of $\pi$ has right edge density \[ f_\pi(u)\sim(1-u)^{\beta-1},L\big((1-u)^{-1}\big)\qquad (u\uparrow 1), \] with $\beta&gt;0$ and $L$ slowly varying; let $\eta$ denote the common law of the i.i.d. initial occupation numbers $\{\eta_x\}_{x\in\mathbb{Z}}$. The survival parameter distribution strictly extends the Beta family, while the lifetime distribution extends the geometric case. We prove a sharp extinction and survival dichotomy with the $\gamma-$dependent threshold \[ \beta_c:=\frac{1}{2\gamma}. \] If $\beta&gt;\beta_c$ and $E(\eta)&lt;\infty$, the process becomes extinct almost surely; if $\beta&lt;\beta_c$ and $P(\eta=0)&lt;1$, it survives with positive probability. At the boundary $\beta=\beta_c$ we provide explicit criteria in terms of $\limsup/\liminf$ of $L(n^{2\gamma})$. The case $\gamma=1$ (geometric lifetimes) recovers the benchmark $\beta_c=\frac{1}{2}$ and the critical refinements previously obtained for random geometric lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Limit behavior of linearly edge-reinforced random walks on the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the article [M. Takei, Electron. J. Probab. 26 (2021), article no. 104], we study the limit behavior of linearly edge-reinforced random walks on the half-line $\mathbb{Z}_+$ with reinforcement parameter $\delta&gt;0$, and each edge $\{x,x+1\}$ has the initial weight $x^{\alpha}\ln^{\beta}x$ for $x &gt; 1$ and $1$ for $x = 0, 1$. The aim of this paper is to study the almost sure limit behavior of the walk in the recurrent regime, and extend the results of Takei mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Collaboration versus Specialization in Service Systems with Impatient Customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tandem queueing systems in which servers work more efficiently in teams than on their own and customers are impatient in that they may leave the system while waiting for service. Our goal is to determine the server assignment policy that maximizes the long-run average throughput. We show that when each server is equally skilled at all tasks, the optimal policy has all the servers working together at all times. We also provide a complete characterization of the optimal policy for Markovian systems with two stations and two servers when each server's efficiency may be task dependent. We show that the throughput is maximized under the policy which assigns one server to each station (based on their relative skill at that station) unless station 2 has no work (in which case both servers work at station 1) or the number of customers in the buffer reaches a threshold whose value we characterize (in which case both servers work at station 2). We study how the optimal policy varies with the level of server synergy (including no synergy) and also compare the optimal policy for systems with different customer abandonment rates (including no abandonments). Finally, we investigate the case where the synergy among collaborating servers can be task-dependent and provide numerical results.</description>

      <title>Stochastically forced compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions of friction type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model of a compressible viscous fluid driven by stochastic forces under slip boundary conditions of friction type. We introduce a notion of a weak solution that is analytically and probabilistically consistent with this model. Our main result establishes the existence of such weak solutions under slip boundary conditions on bounded domains with $C^{2+\nu}$-boundary ($\nu&gt;0$). The proof of this result combines an extended version of the four-layer approximation scheme on the torus by Breit/Feireisl/Hofmanov\'{a} (2018) with the convex approximation method for absolute value functions studied by Ne\v{c}asov\'{a}/Ogorzaly/Scherz (2023).</description>

      <title>Superpositions of CARMA processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce supCARMA processes, defined as superpositions of L\'evy-driven CARMA processes with respect to a L\'evy basis, as a natural extension of the superpositions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type processes. We then focus on supCAR$(2)$ processes and show that they can be classified into three distinct types determined by the eigenstructure of the underlying CAR$(2)$ matrix. For each type we provide conditions for existence and derive explicit expressions for the correlation function. The resulting correlation structures may exhibit long-range dependence and can be non-monotone. These features make supCAR$(2)$ processes a flexible class for modeling time series with oscillatory correlations or strong dependence.</description>

      <title>Optimal stochastic impulse control problem with delay with actions decided at the execution time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of stochastic impulse control problem when there is a fixed delay $\Delta$ between the decision and execution times. The dynamics of the controlled system between two impulses is an arbitrary adapted stochastic process. Unlike the most existing literature, we consider the problem when the impulse sizes are decided at the execution time in both risk-neutral and risk-sensitive cases. This model fits more, in the real life, for some problems such as the pricing of swing options. The horizon T of the problem can be finite or infinite. In each case we show the existence of an optimal strategy. The main tools we use are the notions of reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs for short) and the Snell envelope of processes.</description>

      <title>Extreme Score Distributions in Countable-Outcome Round-Robin Tournaments of Equally Strong Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general class of round-robin tournament models of equally strong players. In these models, each of the $n$ players competes against every other player exactly once. For each match between two players, the outcome is a value from a countable subset of the unit interval, and the scores of the two players in a match sum to one. The final score of each player is defined as the sum of the scores obtained in matches against all other players. We study the distribution of extreme scores, including the maximum, second maximum, and lower-order extremes. Since the exact distribution is computationally intractable even for small values of $n$, we derive asymptotic results as the number of players $n$ tends to infinity, including limiting distributions, and rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Geometry of spherical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical spin glasses are canonical models for smooth random functions in high dimensions. In this review, we survey several interrelated lines of research on their geometric structure. We begin with results concerning critical points and their relationship to the Gibbs measure. For the pure models, the measure concentrates on spherical bands around critical points that approximately maximize the energy at a particular radius. Next, we present another approach in which a similar picture is derived for general mixed models. At the core of this approach is a free energy functional computed over bands using multiple orthogonal replicas, satisfying a strong concentration of measure. We discuss several implications of this method for a generalized Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) approach. Finally, we explain how these geometric insights inform optimization algorithms, and briefly relate them to Smale's 17th problem over the real numbers.</description>

Abstract: We study a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) with time-delayed generators. The forward process includes a reflection component expressed via a Stieltjes integral, while the backward process takes the form of a Generalized BSDE. We establish the connection between this FBSDE system and non-linear path-dependent PDEs with Neumann boundary conditions by deriving a representation formula.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Rough Path Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe $H^p(V)$, a subset of $p$-rough path space $\Omega_p(V)$ which is a vector space under an addition operation $\boxplus$ and a scalar multiplication $\odot$. We show that the domain of $\boxplus$ can be extended to $\Omega_p(V)\times H^p(V)$, allowing any $p$-rough path $X$ to be additively perturbed by an $H\in H^p(V)$. We prove associativity $(X\boxplus H)\boxplus \tilde H = X\boxplus (H\boxplus \tilde H)$ and trivial kernel $X\boxplus H = X \Leftrightarrow H = 1$, where $1$ is the additive zero in $(H^p(V),\boxplus,\odot)$. Finally, we show that enlarging $H^p(V)$ to almost rough paths $H^{am,p}(V)$ does not enlarge the set of displacements of a given $X$, i.e. $\{X\boxplus H: H\in H^p(V)\}=\{X\boxplus H: H\in H^{am,p}(V)\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend recent results on the convergence of ergodic averages along sequences generated by return times to shrinking targets in rapidly mixing systems, partially answering questions posed by the first author, Maass and the third author in [6]. In particular, for a fixed parameter $a\in (0,1)$ and for generic $y\in [0,1]$, we establish both $L^2$ and pointwise convergence for single averages and multiple averages for commuting transformations along the sequences $(a_n(y))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$, obtained by arranging the set $$\Big\{n\in\mathbb{N}: 0&lt;2^ny \mod{1}&lt;n^{-a} \Big\}$$ in an increasing order. We also obtain new results for semi-random ergodic averages along sequences of similar type.</description>

      <title>Mixing times of a Burnside process Markov chain on set partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set and let $G$ be a finite group acting on $X$. The group action splits $X$ into disjoint orbits. The Burnside process is a Markov chain on $X$ which has a uniform stationary distribution when the chain is lumped to orbits. We consider the case where $X = [k]^n$ with $k \geq n$ and $G = S_k$ is the symmetric group on $[k]$, such that $G$ acts on $X$ by permuting the value of each coordinate. The resulting Burnside process gives a novel algorithm for sampling a set partition of $[n]$ uniformly at random. We obtain bounds on the mixing time and show that the chain is rapidly mixing. For the case $k &lt; n$, the algorithm corresponds to sampling a set partition of $[n]$ with at most $k$ blocks, and we obtain a mixing time bound which is independent of $n$. Along the way, we obtain explicit formulas for the transition probabilities and bounds on the second largest eigenvalue for both the original process and the lumped chain.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gauge covariant renormalisation of stochastic 3D Yang-Mills-Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local solutions to the 3D stochastic quantisation equations of Yang-Mills-Higgs were constructed in (arXiv:2201.03487), and it was shown that, in the limit of smooth mollifications, there exists a mass renormalisation of the Yang-Mills field such that the solution is gauge covariant. In this paper we prove uniqueness of the mass renormalisation that leads to gauge covariant solutions. This strengthens the main result of (arXiv:2201.03487), and is potentially important for the identification of the limit of other approximations, such as lattice dynamics. Our proof relies on systematic short-time expansions of singular stochastic PDEs and of regularised Wilson loops. We also strengthen the recently introduced state spaces to allow finer control on line integrals appearing in expansions of Wilson loops.</description>

      <title>Thinning to improve two-sample discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrepancy between two independent samples \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) and \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\) drawn from the same distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ typically has order \(O(\sqrt{n})\) even in one dimension. We give a simple online algorithm that reduces the discrepancy to \(O(\log^{2d} n)\) by discarding a small fraction of the points.</description>

      <title>Moments of density-dependent branching processes and their genealogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A density-dependent branching process is a particle system in which individuals reproduce independently, but in a way that depends on the current population size. This feature can model a wide range of ecological interactions at the cost of breaking the branching property. We propose a general approach for studying the genealogy of these models based on moments. Building on a recent work of Bansaye, we show how to compute recursively these moments in a similar spirit to the many-to-few formula in the theory of branching processes. These formulas enable one to deduce the convergence of the genealogy by studying the population density, for which stochastic calculus techniques are available. As a first application of these ideas, we consider a density-dependent branching process started close to a stable equilibrium of the ecological dynamics. We show that, under a finite second moment assumption, its genealogy converges to Kingman's coalescent when the carrying capacity of the population goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Distributional Limits for Eigenvalues of Graphon Kernel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuation behavior of individual eigenvalues of kernel matrices arising from dense graphon-based random graphs. Under minimal integrability and boundedness assumptions on the graphon, we establish distributional limits for simple, well-separated eigenvalues of the associated integral operator. A sharp probabilistic dichotomy emerges: in the non-degenerate regime, the properly normalized empirical eigenvalue satisfies a central limit theorem with an explicit variance, whereas in the degenerate regime the leading stochastic term vanishes and the centered eigenvalue converges to a weighted chi-square law determined by the operator spectrum.
  The analysis requires no smoothness or Lipschitz conditions on the kernel. Prior work under comparable assumptions established only operator convergence and eigenspace consistency; the present results characterize the full distributional behavior of individual eigenvalues, extending fluctuation theory beyond the reach of classical operator-level arguments. The proofs combine second-order perturbation expansions, concentration bounds for kernel matrices, and Hoeffding decompositions for symmetric statistics, revealing that at the $\sqrt{n}$ scale the dominant randomness arises from latent-position sampling rather than Bernoulli edge noise.</description>

      <title>Utility maximization under endogenous pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.04312v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expected utility maximization problem of a large investor who is allowed to make transactions on tradable assets in an incomplete financial market with endogenous permanent market impacts. The asset prices are assumed to follow a nonlinear price curve quoted in the market as the utility indifference curve of a representative liquidity supplier. Using generalized subgradients, we show that optimality can be fully characterized via a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) which corresponds to a non-linear backward stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE). We show existence of solutions to the optimal investment problem and the FBSDEs in the case where the driver function of the representative market maker grows at least quadratically or the utility function of the large investor falls faster than quadratically or is exponential. Furthermore, we derive smoothness results for the existence of solutions of BSPDEs. Examples are provided when the market is complete, the driver is positively homogeneous or the utility function is exponential.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Bonami's Lemma for functions on spaces of linear maps, and 2-2 Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an analogue of Bonami's (hypercontractive) lemma for complex-valued functions on $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$, where $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces over a finite field. This inequality is useful for functions on $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ whose `generalised influences' are small, in an appropriate sense. It leads to a significant shortening of the proof of a recent seminal result by Khot, Minzer and Safra that pseudorandom sets in Grassmann graphs have near-perfect expansion, which (in combination with the work of Dinur, Khot, Kindler, Minzer and Safra) implies the 2-2 Games conjecture (the variant, that is, with imperfect completeness).</description>

      <title>Explosive appearance of cores and bootstrap percolation on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the process where the $n$ vertices of a square $2$-dimensional torus appear consecutively in a random order. We show that typically the size of the $3$-core of the corresponding induced unit-distance graph transitions from $0$ to $n-o(n)$ within a single step. Equivalently, by infecting the vertices of the torus in a random order, under two-neighbour bootstrap percolation, the size of the infected set transitions instantaneously from $o(n)$ to $n$. This hitting time result answers a question of Benjamini.
  We also study the much more challenging and general setting of bootstrap percolation on two-dimensional lattices for a variety of finite-range infection rules. In this case, powerful but fragile bootstrap percolation tools such as the rectangles process and the Aizenman-Lebowitz lemma become unavailable. We develop a new method complementing and replacing these standard techniques, thus allowing us to prove the above hitting time result for a wide family of threshold bootstrap percolation rules on the $2$-dimensional square lattice, including neighbourhoods given by large $\ell^p$ balls for $p\in[1,\infty]$.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of high-dimensional mixture models: Effective spectral theory and dynamical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local geometry of empirical risks in high dimensions via the spectral theory of their Hessian and information matrices. We focus on settings where the data, $(Y_\ell)_{\ell =1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^d$, are i.i.d. draws of a $k$-Gaussian mixture model, and the loss depends on the projection of the data into a fixed number of vectors, namely $\mathbf{x}^\top Y$, where $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times C}$ are the parameters, and $C$ need not equal $k$. This setting captures a broad class of problems such as classification by one and two-layer networks and regression on multi-index models. We provide exact formulas for the limits of the empirical spectral distribution and outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices in the proportional asymptotics limit, where the number of samples and dimension $n,d\to\infty$ and $n/d=\phi \in (0,\infty)$. These limits depend on the parameters $\mathbf{x}$ only through the summary statistic of the $(C+k)\times (C+k)$ Gram matrix of the parameters and class means, $\mathbf{G} = (\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\mu})^\top(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\mu})$.
  It is known that under general conditions, when $\mathbf{x}$ is trained by online stochastic gradient descent, the evolution of these same summary statistics along training converges to the solution of an autonomous system of ODEs, called the effective dynamics. This enables us to connect the training dynamics to the spectral theory of these matrices generated with test data. We demonstrate our general results by analyzing the effective spectrum along the effective dynamics in the case of multi-class logistic regression. In this setting, the empirical Hessian and information matrices have substantially different spectra, each with their own static and even dynamical spectral transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a standard Lebesgue space $X$, the strong operator closure of the semigroup generated by conditional expectations on $L^\infty(X)$ contains the group of measure-preserving automorphisms. This is based on a solution to the following puzzle: given $n$ full water tanks, each containing one unit of water, and $n$ empty ones, how much water can be transferred from the full tanks to the empty ones by repeatedly equilibrating the water levels between pairs of tanks?</description>

      <title>An $\Omega(\log(N)/N)$ Lookahead is Sufficient to Bound Costs in the Overloaded Loss Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I study the simplest model of revenue management with reusable resources: admission control of two customer classes into a loss queue. This model's long-run average collected reward has two natural upper bounds: the deterministic relaxation and the full-information offline problem. With these bounds, we can decompose the costs faced by the online decision maker into (i) the \emph{cost of variability}, given by the difference between the deterministic value and the offline value, and (ii) the \emph{cost of uncertainty}, given by the difference between the offline value and the online value. \cite{Xie2025} established that the sum of these two costs is $\Theta(\log N)$, as the number of servers, $N$, goes to infinity. I show that we can entirely attribute this $\Theta(\log N)$ rate to the cost of uncertainty, as the cost of variability remains $O(1)$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. In other words, I show that anticipating future fluctuations is sufficient to bound operating costs -- smoothing out these fluctuations is unnecessary. In fact, I show that an $\Omega(\log(N)/N)$ lookahead window is sufficient to bound operating costs.</description>
