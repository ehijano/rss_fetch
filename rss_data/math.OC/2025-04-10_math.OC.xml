      <title>Rounding the Lov\'asz Theta Function with a Value Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz theta function is a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for the maximum weighted stable set problem, which is tight for perfect graphs. However, even for perfect graphs, there is no known rounding method guaranteed to extract an optimal stable set from the SDP solution. In this paper, we develop a novel rounding scheme for the theta function that constructs a value function approximation from the SDP solution and then constructs a stable set using dynamic programming. Our method provably recovers an optimal stable set in several sub-classes of perfect graphs, including generalized split graphs, which asymptotically cover almost all perfect graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only known rounding strategy for the theta function that recovers an optimal stable set for large classes of perfect graphs. Our rounding scheme relies on simple linear algebra computations; we only solve one SDP. In contrast, existing methods for computing an optimal stable set in perfect graphs require solving multiple SDPs. Computational experiments show that our method produces good solutions even on imperfect graphs.</description>

      <title>Unit-Vector Control Design under Saturating Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with unit vector control design for multivariable polytopic uncertain systems under saturating actuators. For that purpose, we propose LMI-based conditions to design the unit vector control gain such that the origin of the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. Moreover, an optimization problem is provided to obtain an enlarged estimate of the region of attraction of the equilibrium point for the closed-loop system, where the convergence of trajectories is ensured even in the presence of saturation functions. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Multivariable Extremum Seeking Unit-Vector Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates multivariable extremum seeking using unit-vector control. By employing the gradient algorithm and a polytopic embedding of the unknown Hessian matrix, we establish sufficient conditions, expressed as linear matrix inequalities, for designing the unit-vector control gain that ensures finite-time stability of the origin of the average closed-loop error system. Notably, these conditions enable the design of non-diagonal control gains, which provide extra degrees of freedom to the solution. The convergence of the actual closed-loop system to a neighborhood of the unknown extremum point is rigorously proven through averaging analysis for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficacy of the proposed extremum seeking control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multi-Secant Quasi-Newton Methods for General Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Newton (QN) methods provide an efficient alternative to second-order methods for minimizing smooth unconstrained problems. While QN methods generally compose a Hessian estimate based on one secant interpolation per iteration, multisecant methods use multiple secant interpolations and can improve the quality of the Hessian estimate at small additional overhead cost. However, implementing multisecant QN methods has several key challenges involving method stability, the most critical of which is that when the objective function is convex but not quadratic, the Hessian approximate is not, in general, symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD), and the steps are not guaranteed to be descent directions.
  We therefore investigate a symmetrized and PSD-perturbed Hessian approximation method for multisecant QN. We offer an efficiently computable method for producing the PSD perturbation, show superlinear convergence of the new method, and demonstrate improved numerical experiments over general convex minimization problems. We also investigate the limited memory extension of the method, focusing on BFGS, on both convex and non-convex functions. Our results suggest that in ill-conditioned optimization landscapes, leveraging multiple secants can accelerate convergence and yield higher-quality solutions compared to traditional single-secant methods.</description>

      <title>Predefined-Time Target Localization and Circumnavigation using Bearing-Only Measurements: Theory and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of controlling an autonomous agent to simultaneously localize and circumnavigate an unknown stationary target using bearing-only measurements (without explicit differentiation). To improve the convergence rate of target estimation, we introduce a novel adaptive target estimator that enables the agent to accurately localize the position of the unknown target with a tunable, predefined convergence time. Following this, we design a controller integrated with the estimator to steer the agent onto a circular trajectory centered at the target with a desired radius. The predefined-time stability of the overall system including the estimation and control errors are rigorously analyzed. Extensive simulations and experiments using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) illustrate the performance and efficacy of the proposed estimation and control algorithms.</description>

      <title>A relaxed version of Ryu's three-operator splitting method for structured nonconvex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modification of Ryu's splitting algorithm for minimizing the sum of three functions, where two of them are convex with Lipschitz continuous gradients, and the third is an arbitrary proper closed function that is not necessarily convex. The modification is essential to facilitate the convergence analysis, particularly in establishing a sufficient descent property for an associated envelope function. This envelope, tailored to the proposed method, is an extension of the well-known Moreau envelope. Notably, the original Ryu splitting algorithm is recovered as a limiting case of our proposal. The results show that the descent property holds as long as the stepsizes remain sufficiently small. Leveraging this result, we prove global subsequential convergence to critical points of the nonconvex objective.</description>

      <title>Min-Max Optimisation for Nonconvex-Nonconcave Functions Using a Random Zeroth-Order Extragradient Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the performance of the random Gaussian smoothing Zeroth-Order ExtraGradient (ZO-EG) scheme considering min-max optimisation problems with possibly NonConvex-NonConcave (NC-NC) objective functions. We consider both unconstrained and constrained, differentiable and non-differentiable settings. We discuss the min-max problem from the point of view of variational inequalities. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to the neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the NC-NC objective function, whose radius can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme, along with its complexity. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal variational inequalities and give examples of functions satisfying this property. Moreover, we prove analogous results to the unconstrained case for the constrained problem. For the non-differentiable case, we prove the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to a neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the smoothed version of the objective function, where the radius of the neighbourhood can be controlled, which can be related to the ($\delta,\epsilon$)-Goldstein stationary point of the original objective function.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optimal Guidance for Intercepting Moving Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonlinear optimal guidance framework for guiding a pursuer to intercept a moving target, with an emphasis on real-time generation of optimal feedback control for a nonlinear optimal control problem. Initially, considering the target moves without maneuvering, we derive the necessary optimality conditions using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. These conditions reveal that each extremal trajectory is uniquely determined by two scalar parameters. Analyzing the geometric property of the parameterized extremal trajectories not only leads to an additional necessary condition but also allows to establish a sufficient condition for local optimality. This enables the generation of a dataset containing at least locally optimal trajectories. By studying the properties of the optimal feedback control, the size of the dataset is reduced significantly, allowing training a lightweight neural network to predict the optimal guidance command in real time. Furthermore, the performance of the neural network is enhanced by incorporating the target's acceleration, making it suitable for intercepting both uniformly moving and maneuvering targets. Finally, numerical simulations validate the proposed nonlinear optimal guidance framework, demonstrating its better performance over existing guidance laws.</description>

      <title>Satellite System Architecting Considering On-Orbit Refueling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the problem of selecting a satellite system architecture considering commercial on-orbit refueling (OOR). The problem aims to answer two questions: "How durable should a satellite be?" and "How much propellant should be loaded into the satellite at launch?" We formulate the problem as a mathematical optimization by adopting the design lifetime and propellant mass as design variables and considering two objective functions to balance the returns and risks. A surrogate model-based framework, grounded in a satellite lifecycle simulation, is developed to address this problem. The developed framework considers various uncertainties and operational flexibility and integrates a modified satellite sizing and cost model by adjusting traditional models with OOR. A design case study of a geosynchronous equatorial orbit communication satellite considering the OOR highlights the effectiveness of the developed framework.</description>

      <title>Continuity conditions weaker than lower semi-continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lower semi-continuity (\texttt{LSC}) is a critical assumption in many foundational optimisation theory results; however, in many cases, \texttt{LSC} is stronger than necessary. This has led to the introduction of numerous weaker continuity conditions that enable more general theorem statements. In the context of unstructured optimization over topological domains, we collect these continuity conditions from disparate sources and review their applications. As primary outcomes, we prove two comprehensive implication diagrams that establish novel connections between the reviewed conditions. In doing so, we also introduce previously missing continuity conditions and provide new counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Smoothed Primal-Dual Algorithms for Nonconvex Optimization with Linear Inequality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose smoothed primal-dual algorithms for solving stochastic and smooth nonconvex optimization problems with linear inequality constraints. Our algorithms are single-loop and only require a single stochastic gradient based on one sample at each iteration. A distinguishing feature of our algorithm is that it is based on an inexact gradient descent framework for the Moreau envelope, where the gradient of the Moreau envelope is estimated using one step of a stochastic primal-dual augmented Lagrangian method. To handle inequality constraints and stochasticity, we combine the recently established global error bounds in constrained optimization with a Moreau envelope-based analysis of stochastic proximal algorithms. For obtaining $\varepsilon$-stationary points, we establish the optimal $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity guarantee for our algorithms and provide extensions to stochastic linear constraints. We also show how to improve this complexity to $O(\varepsilon^{-3})$ by using variance reduction and the expected smoothness assumption. Unlike existing methods, the iterations of our algorithms are free of subproblems, large batch sizes or increasing penalty parameters and use dual variable updates to ensure feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative conductance elements are key to shape the input-output behavior at the terminals of a network through localized positive feedback amplification. The balance of positive and negative differential conductances creates singularities at which rich, intrinsically nonlinear, and ultrasensitive terminal behaviors emerge. Motivated by neuromorphic engineering applications, in this note we extend a recently introduced nonlinear network graphical modeling framework to include negative conductance elements. We use this extended framework to define the class of singular networks and to characterize their ultra-sensitive input/output behaviors at given terminals. Our results are grounded in the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, which is shown to fully characterize the singularities and bifurcations of the input-output behavior at the network terminals, including when the underlying input-output relation is not explicitly computable through other reduction methods.</description>

      <title>The Scaling Behaviors in Achieving High Reliability via Chance-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of resource provisioning under stringent reliability or service level requirements, which arise in applications such as power distribution, emergency response, cloud server provisioning, and regulatory risk management. With chance-constrained optimization serving as a natural starting point for modeling this class of problems, our primary contribution is to characterize how the optimal costs and decisions scale for a generic joint chance-constrained model as the target probability of satisfying the service/reliability constraints approaches its maximal level. Beyond providing insights into the behavior of optimal solutions, our scaling framework has three key algorithmic implications. First, in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) modeling of chance constraints, we show that widely used approaches based on KL-divergences, Wasserstein distances, and moments heavily distort the scaling properties of optimal decisions, leading to exponentially higher costs. In contrast, incorporating marginal distributions or using appropriately chosen f-divergence balls preserves the correct scaling, ensuring decisions remain conservative by at most a constant or logarithmic factor. Second, we leverage the scaling framework to quantify the conservativeness of common inner approximations and propose a simple line search to refine their solutions, yielding near-optimal decisions. Finally, given N data samples, we demonstrate how the scaling framework enables the estimation of approximately Pareto-optimal decisions with constraint violation probabilities significantly smaller than the Omega(1/N)-barrier that arises in the absence of parametric assumptions</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Boundary Control for Euler-Bernoulli Beam PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and analysis of an extremum seeking (ES) controller for scalar static maps in the context of infinite-dimensional dynamics governed by the 1D Euler-Bernoulli (EB) beam Partial Differential Equation (PDE). The beam is actuated at one end (using position and moment actuators). The map's input is the displacement at the beam's uncontrolled end, which is subject to a sliding boundary condition. Notably, ES for this class of PDEs remains unexplored in the existing literature. To compensate for PDE actuation dynamics, we employ a boundary control law via a backstepping transformation and averaging-based estimates for the gradient and Hessian of the static map to be optimized. This compensation controller leverages a Schr\"odinger equation representation of the EB beam and adapts existing backstepping designs to stabilize the beam. Using the semigroup and averaging theory in infinite dimensions, we prove local exponential convergence to a small neighborhood of the unknown optimal point. Finally, simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the design in optimizing the unknown static map.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution by shape optimization method to an inverse shape problem in multi-dimensional advection-diffusion problem with space dependent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on numerically solving a shape identification problem related to advection-diffusion processes with space-dependent coefficients using shape optimization techniques. Two boundary-type cost functionals are considered, and their corresponding variations with respect to shapes are derived using the adjoint method, employing the chain rule approach. This involves firstly utilizing the material derivative of the state system and secondly using its shape derivative. Subsequently, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) combined with the Sobolev-gradient-descent algorithm is applied to stably solve the shape reconstruction problem. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the methods.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Source Seeking Control for Nonholonomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an event-triggered source seeking control (ET-SSC) for autonomous vehicles modeled as the nonholonomic unicycle. The classical source seeking control is enhanced with static-triggering conditions to enable aperiodic and less frequent updates of the system's input signals, offering a resource-aware control design. Our convergence analysis is based on time-scaling combined with Lyapunov and averaging theories for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. ET-SSC ensures exponentially stable behavior for the resulting average system, leading to practical asymptotic convergence to a small neighborhood of the source point. We guarantee the avoidance of Zeno behavior by establishing a minimum dwell time to prevent infinitely fast switching. The performance optimization is aligned with classical continuous-time source seeking algorithms while balancing system performance with actuation resource consumption. Our ET-SSC algorithm, the first of its kind, allows for arbitrarily large inter-sampling times, overcoming the limitations of classical sampled-data implementations for source seeking control.</description>

      <title>Data-driven robust UAV position estimation in GPS signal-challenged environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a position estimation problem for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with both proprioceptive sensors, i.e. IMU, and exteroceptive sensors, i.e. GPS and a barometer. We propose a data-driven position estimation approach based on a robust estimator which takes into account that the UAV model is affected by uncertainties and thus it belongs to an ambiguity set. We propose an approach to learn this ambiguity set from the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new robust filtering paradigm considering the situation in which model uncertainty, described through an ambiguity set, is present only in the observations. We derive the corresponding robust estimator, referred to as update-resilient Kalman filter, which appears to be novel compared to existing minimax game-based filtering approaches. Moreover, we characterize the corresponding least favorable state space model and analyze the filter stability. Finally, some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control For Anti-Abeta Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease using a Reaction-Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impairs patient survival and quality of life. While current pharmacological treatments aim to slow disease progression, they remain insufficient in halting cognitive decline. Mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of AD and optimizing treatment strategies. However, most existing models focus on temporal dynamics using ordinary differential equation-based approaches, often neglecting the critical role of spatial heterogeneity in disease progression.
  In this study, we employ a spatially explicit reaction-diffusion model to describe amyloid-beta (A beta) dynamics in the brain, incorporating treatment optimization while accounting for potential side effects. Our objective is to minimize amyloid-beta plaque concentration while balancing therapeutic efficacy against adverse effects, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Under specific assumptions, we establish the well-posedness and uniqueness of the optimal solution. We employ numerical methods based on the Finite Element Method to compute personalized treatment strategies, leveraging real patient amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (PET) scan data.
  Our results demonstrate that optimal treatment strategies outperform constant dosing regimens, achieving significant reductions in amyloid burden while minimizing side effects. By integrating spatial dynamics and personalized treatment planning, our framework offers a novel approach to refining therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonemptiness, compactness, uniqueness, and finiteness of the solution set of a new type of nonlinear complementarity problem, namely the extended horizontal tensor complementarity problem (EHTCP).

      <title>Implied Integrality in Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implied-integer detection is a well-known presolving technique that is used by many Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solvers. Informally, a variable is said to be implied integer if its integrality is enforced implicitly by integrality of other variables and the constraints of a problem. In this paper we formalize the definition of implied integrality by taking a polyhedral perspective. Our main result characterizes implied integrality as occurring when a subset of integer variables is fixed to integer values and the polyhedron on the remaining variables is integral. While integral polyhedra are well-understood theoretically, existing detection methods infer implied integrality only for one variable at a time. We introduce new detection methods based on the detection of integral polyhedra, extending existing techniques to multiple variables. Additionally, we discuss the computational complexity of recognizing implied integers. We conduct experiments using a new detection method that uses totally unimodular submatrices to identify implied integrality. For the MIPLIB 2017 collection dataset our results indicate that, on average, 18.8% of the variables are classified as implied integer after presolving, compared to just 3.3% identified by state-of-the-art techniques. We are able to reduce the average percentage of variables whose integrality needs to be enforced after presolving from 70.2% to 59.0%.</description>

      <title>Compositional design for time-varying and nonlinear coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the design of multi-agent coordination through high-order consensus protocols. While first-order consensus strategies are well-studied -- with known robustness to uncertainties such as time delays, time-varying weights, and nonlinearities like saturations -- the theoretical guarantees for high-order consensus are comparatively limited. We propose a compositional control framework that generates high-order consensus protocols by serially connecting stable first-order consensus operators. Under mild assumptions, we establish that the resulting high-order system inherits stability properties from its components. The proposed design is versatile and supports a wide range of real-world constraints. This is demonstrated through applications inspired by vehicular formation control, including protocols with time-varying weights, bounded time-varying delays, and saturated inputs. We derive theoretical guarantees for these settings using the proposed compositional approach and demonstrate the advantages gained compared to conventional protocols in simulations.</description>

      <title>When Koopman Meets Hamilton and Jacobi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between the spectral theory of the Koopman operator and the solution of the Hamilton Jacobi (HJ) equation. The HJ equation occupies a central place in systems theory, and its solution is of interest in various control problems, including optimal control, robust control, and input-output analysis. A Hamiltonian dynamical system can be associated with the HJ equation and the solution of the HJ equation can be extracted from the Hamiltonian system in the form of Lagrangian submanifold. One of the main contributions of this paper is to show that the Lagrangian submanifolds can be obtained using the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator. We present two different procedures for the approximation of the HJ solution. We utilize the spectral properties of the Koopman operator associated with the uncontrolled dynamical system and Hamiltonian systems to approximate the HJ solution. We present a convex optimization-based computational framework with convergence analysis for approximating the Koopman eigenfunctions and the Lagrangian submanifolds. Our solution approach to the HJ equation using Koopman theory provides for a natural extension of results from linear systems to nonlinear systems. We demonstrate the application of this work for solving the optimal control problem. Finally, we present simulation results to validate the paper's main findings and compare them against linear quadratic regulator and Taylor series based approximation controllers.</description>

      <title>State Estimation Using Particle Filtering in Adaptive Machine Learning Methods: Integrating Q-Learning and NEAT Algorithms with Noisy Radar Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable state estimation is essential for autonomous systems operating in complex, noisy environments. Classical filtering approaches, such as the Kalman filter, can struggle when facing nonlinear dynamics or non-Gaussian noise, and even more flexible particle filters often encounter sample degeneracy or high computational costs in large-scale domains. Meanwhile, adaptive machine learning techniques, including Q-learning and neuroevolutionary algorithms such as NEAT, rely heavily on accurate state feedback to guide learning; when sensor data are imperfect, these methods suffer from degraded convergence and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that unifies particle filtering with Q-learning and NEAT to explicitly address the challenge of noisy measurements. By refining radar-based observations into reliable state estimates, our particle filter drives more stable policy updates (in Q-learning) or controller evolution (in NEAT), allowing both reinforcement learning and neuroevolution to converge faster, achieve higher returns or fitness, and exhibit greater resilience to sensor uncertainty. Experiments on grid-based navigation and a simulated car environment highlight consistent gains in training stability, final performance, and success rates over baselines lacking advanced filtering. Altogether, these findings underscore that accurate state estimation is not merely a preprocessing step, but a vital component capable of substantially enhancing adaptive machine learning in real-world applications plagued by sensor noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of controlling collective behavior in complex systems comprising large ensembles of interacting dynamical agents. Building upon traditional control theory's foundation in individual systems, we introduce tools designed to address the unique challenges of coordinating networks that exhibit emergent phenomena, including consensus, synchronization, and pattern formation. We analyze how local agent interactions generate macroscopic behaviors and investigate the fundamental role of network topology in determining system dynamics. Inspired by natural systems, we emphasize control strategies that achieve global coordination through localized interventions while considering practical implementation challenges. The chapter concludes by presenting novel frameworks for managing very large agent ensembles and leveraging interacting networks for control purposes.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative assignment with upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a problem related to submodular function optimization and the exact matching problem for which we show a rather peculiar status: its natural LP-relaxation can have fractional optimal vertices, but there is always also an optimal integral vertex, which we can also compute in polynomial time.
  More specifically, we consider the multiplicative assignment problem with upgrades in which we are given a set of customers and suppliers and we seek to assign each customer to a different supplier. Each customer has a demand and each supplier has a regular and an upgraded cost for each unit demand provided to the respective assigned client. Our goal is to upgrade at most $k$ suppliers and to compute an assignment in order to minimize the total resulting cost. This can be cast as the problem to compute an optimal matching in a bipartite graph with the additional constraint that we must select $k$ edges from a certain group of edges, similar to selecting $k$ red edges in the exact matching problem. Also, selecting the suppliers to be upgraded corresponds to maximizing a submodular set function under a cardinality constraint.
  Our result yields an efficient LP-based algorithm to solve our problem optimally. In addition, we provide also a purely strongly polynomial-time algorithm for it. As an application, we obtain exact algorithms for the upgrading variant of the problem to schedule jobs on identical or uniformly related machines in order to minimize their sum of completion times, i.e., where we may upgrade up to $k$ jobs to reduce their respective processing times.</description>

Abstract: Low-thrust, many-revolution transfers between near-rectilinear halo orbits and low lunar orbits are challenging due to the many-revolutions and is further complicated by three-body perturbation. To address these challenges, we extend hybrid differential dynamic programming by enhancing with a continuation of dynamical system. The optimization begins with the Sundman-transformed two-body problem and gradually transitions to the Sundman-transformed circular restricted three-body problem expressed in the moon-centered inertial frame. Numerical examples demonstrate the robust convergence of our method, where optimal transfers from low lunar orbit to near-rectilinear halo orbit are obtained with a poor initial guess of low lunar orbit.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Sampling-Based Stability Guarantee for Data-Driven Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.06240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a sampling-based method to guarantee robust stability of general control systems with uncertainty. The method allows the system dynamics and controllers to be represented by various data-driven models, such as Gaussian processes and deep neural networks. For nonlinear systems, stability conditions involve inequalities over an infinite number of states in a state space. Sampling-based approaches can simplify these hard conditions into inequalities discretized over a finite number of states. However, this simplification requires margins to compensate for discretization residuals. Large margins degrade the accuracy of stability evaluation, and obtaining appropriate margins for various systems is challenging. This study addresses this challenge by deriving second-order margins for various nonlinear systems containing data-driven models. Because the size of the derived margins decrease quadratically as the discretization interval decreases, the stability evaluation is more accurate than with first-order margins. Furthermore, this study designs feedback controllers by integrating the sampling-based approach with an optimization problem. As a result, the controllers can guarantee stability while simultaneously considering control performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the convergence rate of policy iteration for (deterministic) optimal control problems in continuous time. To overcome the problem of ill-posedness due to lack of regularity, we consider a semi-discrete scheme by adding a viscosity term via finite differences in space. We prove that PI for the semi-discrete scheme converges exponentially fast, and provide a bound on the error induced by the semi-discrete scheme. We also consider the discrete space-time scheme, where both space and time are discretized. Convergence rate of PI and the discretization error are studied.</description>

      <title>Modified Armijo line search in optimization on Riemannian submanifolds with reduced computational cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds, many types of globally convergent algorithms have been proposed, and they are often equipped with the Riemannian version of the Armijo line search for global convergence. Such existing methods need to compute the value of a retraction mapping regarding the search direction several times at each iteration; this may result in high computational costs, particularly if computing the value of the retraction is expensive. To address this issue, this study focuses on Riemannian submanifolds of the Euclidean spaces and proposes a novel Riemannian line search that achieves lower computational cost by incorporating a new strategy that computes the retraction only when inevitable. A class of Riemannian optimization algorithms, including the steepest descent and Newton methods, with the new line search strategy is proposed and proved to be globally convergent. Furthermore, numerical experiments on solving optimization problems on several types of Riemannian submanifolds illustrate that the proposed methods are superior to the standard Riemannian Armijo line search-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a Merton's optimal portfolio and consumption problem in an extended formulation by incorporating the benchmark tracking on the wealth process. We consider a tracking formulation such that the wealth process compensated by a fictitious capital injection outperforms the benchmark at all times. The fund manager aims to maximize the expected utility of consumption deducted by the cost of the capital injection, where the latter term can also be interpreted as the expected largest shortfall of the wealth with reference to the benchmark. By considering an auxiliary state process, we formulate an equivalent stochastic control problem with state reflections at zero. For general utility functions and It\^o diffusion benchmark process, we develop a convex duality theorem, new to the literature, to the auxiliary stochastic control problem with state reflections in which the dual process also exhibits reflections from above. For CRRA utility and geometric Brownian motion benchmark process, we further derive the optimal portfolio and consumption in feedback form using the new duality theorem, allowing us to discuss some interesting financial implications induced by the additional risk-taking from the capital injection and the goal of tracking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with robust stochastic optimal control problems. The main contribution is an extension of the Progressive Hedging Algorithm (PHA) that enhances outof-sample robustness while preserving numerical complexity. This extension consists of taking up the widespread practice in machine learning of variance penalization into stochastic optimal control problems. Using the Douglas-Rachford splitting method, the author developed a Regularized Progressive Hedging Algorithm (RPHA) with the same numerical complexity as the standard PHA and better out-of-sample performances. In addition, the authors propose a three-step control framework consisting of a random scenario generation method, followed by a scenario reduction algorithm, and a scenario-based optimal control computation using the RPHA. Finally, the authors test the proposed method to simulate a stationary battery's Energy Management System (EMS) using ground truth measurements of electricity consumption and production from a mainly commercial building in Solaize, France. This simulation shows that the proposed method is more efficient than a classical Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, which is, in turn, more efficient than the standard PHA.</description>

      <title>Two Timescale EXTRA for Smooth Non-convex Distributed Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Two-timescale EXTRA (TT-EXTRA), extending the well-known EXact firsT-ordeR Algorithm (EXTRA) by incorporating two stepsizes, for distributed non-convex optimization over multi-agent networks. Due to the two-timescale strategy, we are able to construct a suitable Lyapunov function and establish the sub-linear convergence to consensual first-order stationary points. Additionally, we introduce a sequential parameter selection method and the numerical results support the theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Coordinated vehicle dispatching and charging scheduling for an electric ride-hailing fleet under charging congestion and dynamic prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective utilization of charging station capacity plays an important role in enhancing the profitability of ride-hailing systems using electric vehicles. Existing studies assume constant energy prices and uncapacitated charging stations or do not explicitly consider vehicle queueing at charging stations, resulting in over-optimistic charging infrastructure utilization. In this study, we develop a dynamic charging scheduling method (named CongestionAware) that anticipates vehicles' energy needs and coordinates their charging operations with real-time energy prices to avoid long waiting time at charging stations and increase the total profit of the system. A sequential mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to devise vehicles' day-ahead charging plans based on their experienced charging waiting times and energy consumption. The obtained charging plans are adapted within the day in response to vehicles' energy needs and charging station congestion. The developed charging policy is tested using NYC yellow taxi data in a Manhattan-like study area with a fleet size of 100 vehicles given the scenarios of 3000 and 4000 customers per day. The computational results show that our CongestionAware policy outperforms different benchmark policies with up to +15.06% profit and +19.16% service rate for 4000 customers per day. Sensitivity analysis is conducted with different system parameters and managerial insights are discussed.</description>

      <title>Extended Set Difference : Inverse Operation of Minkowski Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the extended set difference, a generalization of the Hukuhara and generalized Hukuhara differences, defined for compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The proposed difference guarantees existence for any pair of such sets, offering a broader framework for set arithmetic. The difference may not be necessarily unique, but we offer a bound on the variety of solutions. The definition of the extended set difference is formulated through an optimization problem, which provides a constructive approach to its computation. The paper explores the properties of this new difference, including its stability under orthogonal transformations and its robustness to perturbations of the input sets. We propose a method to compute this difference through a formulated linear optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Safety Control of Impulsive Systems with Control Barrier Functions and Adaptive Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the safety challenges in impulsive systems, where abrupt state jumps introduce significant complexities into system dynamics. A unified framework is proposed by integrating Quadratic Programming (QP), Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), and adaptive gain mechanisms to ensure system safety during impulsive events. The CBFs are constructed to enforce safety constraints by capturing the system's continuous dynamics and the effects of impulsive state transitions. An adaptive gain mechanism dynamically adjusts control inputs based on the magnitudes of the impulses and the system's proximity to safety boundaries, maintaining safety during instantaneous state jumps. A tailored QP formulation incorporates CBFs constraints and adaptive gain adjustments, optimizing control inputs while ensuring compliance with safety-critical requirements. Theoretical analysis establishes the boundedness, continuity, and feasibility of the adaptive gain and the overall framework. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations on a robotic manipulator, showcasing its practical applicability to impulsive systems with state jumps.</description>

      <title>Infinity-norm-based Input-to-State-Stable Long Short-Term Memory networks: a thermal systems perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown remarkable performances in system identification, particularly in nonlinear dynamical systems such as thermal processes. However, stability remains a critical challenge in practical applications: although the underlying process may be intrinsically stable, there may be no guarantee that the resulting RNN model captures this behavior. This paper addresses the stability issue by deriving a sufficient condition for Input-to-State Stability based on the infinity-norm (ISS$_{\infty}$) for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The obtained condition depends on fewer network parameters compared to prior works. A ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted training strategy is developed, incorporating a penalty term in the loss function that encourages stability and an ad hoc early stopping approach. The quality of LSTM models trained via the proposed approach is validated on a thermal system case study, where the ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted LSTM outperforms both a physics-based model and an ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network while also surpassing non-ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted LSTM and GRU RNNs.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Converges to the Globally Optimal Policy for Nearly Linear-Quadratic Regulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08431v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear control systems with partial information to the decision maker are prevalent in a variety of applications. As a step toward studying such nonlinear systems, this work explores reinforcement learning methods for finding the optimal policy in the nearly linear-quadratic regulator systems. In particular, we consider a dynamic system that combines linear and nonlinear components, and is governed by a policy with the same structure. Assuming that the nonlinear component comprises kernels with small Lipschitz coefficients, we characterize the optimization landscape of the cost function. Although the cost function is nonconvex in general, we establish the local strong convexity and smoothness in the vicinity of the global optimizer. Additionally, we propose an initialization mechanism to leverage these properties. Building on the developments, we design a policy gradient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal policy with a linear rate.</description>

      <title>Untangling Lariats: Subgradient Following of Variationally Penalized Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04710v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an apparatus for subgradient-following of the optimum of convex problems with variational penalties. In this setting, we receive a sequence $y_i,\ldots,y_n$ and seek a smooth sequence $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. The smooth sequence needs to attain the minimum Bregman divergence to an input sequence with additive variational penalties in the general form of $\sum_i{}g_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)$. We derive known algorithms such as the fused lasso and isotonic regression as special cases of our approach. Our approach also facilitates new variational penalties such as non-smooth barrier functions.
  We then derive a novel lattice-based procedure for subgradient following of variational penalties characterized through the output of arbitrary convolutional filters. This paradigm yields efficient solvers for high-order filtering problems of temporal sequences in which sparse discrete derivatives such as acceleration and jerk are desirable. We also introduce and analyze new multivariate problems in which $\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ with variational penalties that depend on $\|\mathbf{x}_{i+1}-\mathbf{x}_i\|$. The norms we consider are $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ which promote group sparsity.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ill-conditioned Hankel Matrix Recovery via Structured Newton-like Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust Hankel recovery problem, which simultaneously removes the sparse outliers and fulfills missing entries from the partial observation. We propose a novel non-convex algorithm, coined Hankel Structured Newton-Like Descent (HSNLD), to tackle the robust Hankel recovery problem. HSNLD is highly efficient with linear convergence, and its convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the underlying Hankel matrix. The recovery guarantee has been established under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show the superior performance of HSNLD against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analog of the describing function method is developed using square waves rather than sinusoids. Static nonlinearities map square waves to square waves, and their behavior is characterized by their response to square waves of varying amplitude - their amplitude response. The output of an LTI system to a square wave input is approximated by a square wave, to give an analog of the describing function. The classical describing function method for predicting oscillations in feedback interconnections is generalized to this square wave setting, and gives accurate predictions when oscillations are approximately square.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the large-scale behaviour of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems on random graphs. In such problems, a random nonlinear cost functional is minimised among all flows (discrete vector-fields) with a prescribed net flux through each vertex. On a stationary random graph embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, our main result asserts that these problems converge, in the large-scale limit, to a continuous minimisation problem where an effective cost functional is minimised among all vector fields with prescribed divergence. Our main result is formulated using $\Gamma$-convergence and applies to multi-species problems. The proof employs the blow-up technique by Fonseca and M\"uller in a discrete setting. One of the main challenges overcome is the construction of the homogenised energy density on random graphs without a periodic structure.</description>

Abstract: Our study concerns the Euclidean distance function in case of complex plane curves. We decompose the ED discriminant into 3 parts which are responsible for the 3 types of behavior of the Morse points, and we find the structure of each one. In particular we shed light on the ``atypical discriminant'' which is due to the loss of Morse points at infinity. We find formulas for the number of Morse singularities which abut to the corresponding 3 types of attractors when moving the centre of the distance function toward a point of the discriminant.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor log-concave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Adversarial Constrained Online Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) can be seen as a generalization of the standard Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework. At each round, a cost function and constraint function are revealed after a learner chooses an action. The goal is to minimize both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. We show for the first time that is possible to obtain the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on both regret and CCV, improving the best known bounds of $O \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ for the regret and CCV, respectively. Based on a new surrogate loss function enforcing a minimum penalty on the constraint function, we demonstrate that both the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader and the Online Gradient Descent achieve the optimal bounds.</description>

      <title>Universal Architectures for the Learning of Polyhedral Norms and Convex Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning convex regularizers to guide the reconstruction of images from limited data. By imposing that the reconstruction be amplitude-equivariant, we narrow down the class of admissible functionals to those that can be expressed as a power of a seminorm. We then show that such functionals can be approximated to arbitrary precision with the help of polyhedral norms. In particular, we identify two dual parameterizations of such systems: (i) a synthesis form with an $\ell_1$-penalty that involves some learnable dictionary; and (ii) an analysis form with an $\ell_\infty$-penalty that involves a trainable regularization operator. After having provided geometric insights and proved that the two forms are universal, we propose an implementation that relies on a specific architecture (tight frame with a weighted $\ell_1$ penalty) that is easy to train. We illustrate its use for denoising and the reconstruction of biomedical images. We find that the proposed framework outperforms the sparsity-based methods of compressed sensing, while it offers essentially the same convergence and robustness guarantees.</description>
