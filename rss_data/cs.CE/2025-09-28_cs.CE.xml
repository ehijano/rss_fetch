      <title>Sci2Pol: Evaluating and Fine-tuning LLMs on Scientific-to-Policy Brief Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Sci2Pol-Bench and Sci2Pol-Corpus, the first benchmark and training dataset for evaluating and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on policy brief generation from a scientific paper. We build Sci2Pol-Bench on a five-stage taxonomy to mirror the human writing process: (i) Autocompletion, (ii) Understanding, (iii) Summarization, (iv) Generation, and (v) Verification. It features 18 tasks in multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Specifically, for the Generation stage, we show that BERTScore and ROUGE scores fail to capture the quality of brief writing, and introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric aligned with expert judgement. Using this benchmark, we evaluate 13 leading open-source and commercial LLMs to uncover key limitations. To improve LLM performance on brief writing, we curate the Sci2Pol-Corpus for fine-tuning. We start by linking each cited scientific paper to its corresponding policy document, drawn from 5.6 million policy records. This produces 140,000 candidate pairs. We then employ an LLM-as-a-judge to filter high-quality examples, followed by in-context polishing using three expert-written samples as references. This process yields a final set of 639 new pairs. Finally, we fine-tune three models on Sci2Pol-Corpus: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-12B, and Gemma-27B. Fine-tuning leads to consistent performance improvements across Sci2Pol-Bench. Notably, after fine-tuning, Gemma-27B surpasses the much larger GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 (671B). These demonstrate the effectiveness of our corpus in bridging the gap between science and policy.</description>

      <title>QuantMind: A Context-Engineering Based Knowledge Framework for Quantitative Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative research increasingly relies on unstructured financial content such as filings, earnings calls, and research notes, yet existing LLM and RAG pipelines struggle with point-in-time correctness, evidence attribution, and integration into research workflows. To tackle this, We present QuantMind, an intelligent knowledge extraction and retrieval framework tailored to quantitative finance. QuantMind adopts a two-stage architecture: (i) a knowledge extraction stage that transforms heterogeneous documents into structured knowledge through multi-modal parsing of text, tables, and formulas, adaptive summarization for scalability, and domain-specific tagging for fine-grained indexing; and (ii) an intelligent retrieval stage that integrates semantic search with flexible strategies, multi-hop reasoning across sources, and knowledge-aware generation for auditable outputs. A controlled user study demonstrates that QuantMind improves both factual accuracy and user experience compared to unaided reading and generic AI assistance, underscoring the value of structured, domain-specific context engineering for finance.</description>

      <title>AI for Sustainable Future Foods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global food systems must deliver nutritious and sustainable foods while sharply reducing environmental impact. Yet, food innovation remains slow, empirical, and fragmented. Artificial intelligence (AI) now offers a transformative path with the potential to link molecular composition to functional performance, bridge chemical structure to sensory outcomes, and accelerate cross-disciplinary innovation across the entire production pipeline. Here we outline AI for Food as an emerging discipline that integrates ingredient design, formulation development, fermentation and production, texture analysis, sensory properties, manufacturing, and recipe generation. Early successes demonstrate how AI can predict protein performance, map molecules to flavor, and tailor consumer experiences. But significant challenges remain: lack of standardization, scarce multimodal data, cultural and nutritional diversity, and low consumer confidence. We propose three priorities to unlock the field: treating food as a programmable biomaterial, building self-driving laboratories for automated discovery, and developing deep reasoning models that integrate sustainability and human health. By embedding AI responsibly into the food innovation cycle, we can accelerate the transition to sustainable protein systems and chart a predictive, design-driven science of food for our own health and the health of our planet.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Method of Moments and Generalized Scattering Matrix: Applications to Antennas in Radomes, Reflectors, and Implantable Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic analysis of antennas embedded in or interacting with large surrounding structures poses inherent multiscale challenges: the antenna is electrically small yet geometrically detailed, while the environment is electrically large but comparatively smooth. To address this, we present a hybrid method of moments (MoM) and generalized scattering matrix (GSM) framework that achieves a clean separation between fine-scale and large-scale complexities while preserving their full mutual coupling. Antennas of arbitrary geometry can be characterized once and reused across different environments, or conversely, a given environment can be modeled once to accommodate multiple antenna designs. The framework is inherently versatile, encompassing GSM-PO and GSM + T-matrix extensions, and thus provides a unified paradigm for multiscale antenna modeling. With the large body always represented by the formulation best suited to its scale and shape, the approach combines accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability. Numerical validations on implantable antennas, radome-protected arrays, and reflector systems confirm excellent agreement with full-wave solvers while demonstrating dramatic reductions in computational cost for design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Orochi: Versatile Biomedical Image Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a pivotal tool for accelerating research in the life sciences, with the low-level processing of biomedical images (e.g., registration, fusion, restoration, super-resolution) being one of its most critical applications. Platforms such as ImageJ (Fiji) and napari have enabled the development of customized plugins for various models. However, these plugins are typically based on models that are limited to specific tasks and datasets, making them less practical for biologists. To address this challenge, we introduce Orochi, the first application-oriented, efficient, and versatile image processor designed to overcome these limitations. Orochi is pre-trained on patches/volumes extracted from the raw data of over 100 publicly available studies using our Random Multi-scale Sampling strategy. We further propose Task-related Joint-embedding Pre-Training (TJP), which employs biomedical task-related degradation for self-supervision rather than relying on Masked Image Modelling (MIM), which performs poorly in downstream tasks such as registration. To ensure computational efficiency, we leverage Mamba's linear computational complexity and construct Multi-head Hierarchy Mamba. Additionally, we provide a three-tier fine-tuning framework (Full, Normal, and Light) and demonstrate that Orochi achieves comparable or superior performance to current state-of-the-art specialist models, even with lightweight parameter-efficient options. We hope that our study contributes to the development of an all-in-one workflow, thereby relieving biologists from the overwhelming task of selecting among numerous models.</description>

      <title>Linear Risk Sharing on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade alternatives to traditional insurance and banking have grown in popularity. The desire to encourage local participation has lead products such as peer-to-peer insurance, reciprocal contracts, and decentralized finance platforms to increasingly rely on network structures to redistribute risk among participants. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework for linear risk sharing (LRS), where random losses are reallocated through nonnegative linear operators which can accommodate a wide range of networks. Building on the theory of stochastic and doubly stochastic matrices, we establish conditions under which constraints such as budget balance, fairness, and diversification are guaranteed. The convex order framework allows us to compare different allocations rigorously, highlighting variance reduction and majorization as natural consequences of doubly stochastic mixing. We then extend the analysis to network-based sharing, showing how their topology shapes risk outcomes in complete, star, ring, random, and scale-free graphs. A second layer of randomness, where the sharing matrix itself is random, is introduced via Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi and preferential-attachment networks, connecting risk-sharing properties to degree distributions. Finally, we study convex combinations of identity and network-induced operators, capturing the trade-off between self-retention and diversification. Our results provide design principles for fair and efficient peer-to-peer insurance and network-based risk pooling, combining mathematical soundness with economic interpretability.</description>

      <title>Designing Ethereum's Geographical (De)Centralization Beyond the Atlantic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralization has a geographic dimension that conventional metrics such as stake distribution overlook. Where validators run affects resilience to regional shocks (outages, disasters, government intervention) and fairness in reward access. Yet in permissionless systems, locations cannot be mandated, but they emerge from incentives. Today, Ethereum's validators cluster along the Atlantic (EU and U.S. East Coast), where latency is structurally favorable. This raises a key question: when some regions already enjoy latency advantages, how does protocol design shape validator incentives and the geography of (de)centralization? We develop a latency-calibrated agent-based model and compare two Ethereum block-building paradigms: a Single-Source Paradigm (SSP), akin to MEV-Boost, where proposers fetch full blocks from a relay that also propagates them; and a Multi-Source Paradigm (MSP), where proposers aggregate value from multiple sources and broadcast the block themselves. Simulations show that SSP concentrates around relay placement but more slowly, since proximity mainly affects propagation, and the marginal value of time is relatively uniform across regions. MSP centralizes faster: aggregating across sources makes marginal value location-dependent, amplifying payoff dispersion and migration toward latency minima. Source placement and consensus settings can dampen or intensify these effects, though once validators are already clustered, the impact of source placement on decentralization is marginal. In most cases, North America consistently emerges as the focal hub. These findings show that protocol design materially shapes validator geography and offer levers for promoting geographical decentralization.</description>

      <title>AutoClimDS: Climate Data Science Agentic AI -- A Knowledge Graph is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph (KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible, extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Bacterial Gene Regulatory Neural Network as a Biocomputing Library of Mathematical Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current biocomputing approaches predominantly rely on engineered circuits with fixed logic, offering limited stability and reliability under diverse environmental conditions. Here, we use the GRNN framework introduced in our previous work to transform bacterial gene expression dynamics into a biocomputing library of mathematical solvers. We introduce a sub-GRNN search algorithm that identifies functional subnetworks tailored to specific mathematical calculation and classification tasks by evaluating gene expression patterns across chemically encoded input conditions. Tasks include identifying Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, multiplication, and Collatz step counts. The identified problem-specific sub-GRNNs are then assessed using gene-wise and collective perturbation, as well as Lyapunov-based stability analysis, to evaluate robustness and reliability. Our results demonstrate that native transcriptional machinery can be harnessed to perform diverse mathematical calculation and classification tasks, while maintaining computing stability and reliability.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Sustainable Remanufacturing, Reusing and Recycling for Lithium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sustainable utilization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial to the global energy transition and carbon neutrality, yet data scarcity and heterogeneity remain major barriers across remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This dissertation develops a machine learning assisted framework to address these challenges throughout the battery lifecycle. A physics informed quality control model predicts long-term degradation from limited early-cycle data, while a generative learning based residual value assessment method enables rapid and accurate evaluation of retired batteries under random conditions. A federated learning strategy achieves privacy preserving and high precision cathode material sorting, supporting efficient recycling. Furthermore, a unified diagnostics and prognostics framework based on correlation alignment enhances adaptability across tasks such as state of health estimation, state of charge estimation, and remaining useful life prediction under varied testing protocols. Collectively, these contributions advance sustainable battery management by integrating physics, data generation, privacy preserving collaboration, and adaptive learning, offering methodological innovations to promote circular economy and global carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Domain-adaptive Post-training for Financial LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs</description>
