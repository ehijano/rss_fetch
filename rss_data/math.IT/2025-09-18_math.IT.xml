      <title>Efficient STAR-RIS Mode for Energy Minimization in WPT-FL Networks with NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the massive deployment of IoT devices in 6G networks, several critical challenges have emerged, such as large communication overhead, coverage limitations, and limited battery lifespan. FL, WPT, multi-antenna AP, and RIS can mitigate these challenges by reducing the need for large data transmissions, enabling sustainable energy harvesting, and optimizing the propagation environment. Compared to conventional RIS, STAR-RIS not only extends coverage from half-space to full-space but also improves energy saving through appropriate mode selection. Motivated by the need for sustainable, low-latency, and energy-efficient communication in large-scale IoT networks, this paper investigates the efficient STAR-RIS mode in the uplink and downlink phases of a WPT-FL multi-antenna AP network with non-orthogonal multiple access to minimize energy consumption, a joint optimization that remains largely unexplored in existing works on RIS or STAR-RIS. We formulate a non-convex energy minimization problem for different STAR-RIS modes, i.e., energy splitting (ES) and time switching (TS), in both uplink and downlink transmission phases, where STAR-RIS phase shift vectors, beamforming matrices, time and power for harvesting, uplink transmission, and downlink transmission, local processing time, and computation frequency for each user are jointly optimized. To tackle the non-convexity, the problem is decoupled into two subproblems: the first subproblem optimizes STAR-RIS phase shift vectors and beamforming matrices across all WPT-FL phases using block coordinate descent over either semi-definite programming or Rayleigh quotient problems, while the second one allocates time, power, and computation frequency via the one-dimensional search algorithms or the bisection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Uplink-Downlink Duality for Beamforming in Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the beamforming and power optimization problem for a class of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) problems that utilize the communication signals simultaneously for sensing. We formulate the problem of minimizing the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) on the mean-squared error of estimating a vector of parameters, while satisfying downlink signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio constraints for a set of communication users at the same time. The proposed optimization framework comprises two key new ingredients. First, we show that the BCRB minimization problem corresponds to maximizing beamforming power along certain sensing directions of interest. Second, the classical uplink-downlink duality for multiple-input multiple-output communications can be extended to the ISAC setting, but unlike the classical communication problem, the dual uplink problem for ISAC may entail negative noise power and needs to include an extra condition on the uplink beamformers. This new duality theory opens doors for an efficient iterative algorithm for optimizing power and beamformers for ISAC.</description>

      <title>Clustering Strategies in Satellite-Aided Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of next-generation satellite networks, addressing clustering tasks, user grouping, and efficient link management has become increasingly critical to optimize network performance and reduce interference. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of modern clustering approaches based on machine learning and heuristic algorithms. The experimental results indicate that improved machine learning techniques and graph theory-based methods deliver significantly better performance and scalability than conventional clustering methods, such as the pure clustering algorithm examined in previous research. These advantages are especially evident in large-scale satellite network scenarios. Furthermore, the paper outlines potential research directions and discusses integrated, multi-dimensional solutions to enhance adaptability and efficiency in future satellite communication.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Nonlinear One-Bit Precoding in Massive MIMO Systems via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing one-bit digital-to-analog converters offer a hardware-efficient solution for wireless communications. However, the one-bit constraint poses significant challenges for precoding design, as it transforms the problem into a discrete and nonconvex optimization task. In this paper, we investigate a widely adopted ``convex-relaxation-then-quantization" approach for nonlinear symbol-level one-bit precoding. Specifically, we first solve a convex relaxation of the discrete minimum mean square error precoding problem, and then quantize the solution to satisfy the one-bit constraint. To analyze the high-dimensional asymptotic performance of this scheme, we develop a novel analytical framework based on approximate message passing (AMP). This framework enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) at the receiver side in the large-system limit, which provides a quantitative characterization of how model and system parameters affect the SEP performance. Our empirical results suggest that the $\ell_\infty^2$ regularizer, when paired with an optimally chosen regularization parameter, achieves optimal SEP performance within a broad class of convex regularization functions. As a first step towards a theoretical justification, we prove the optimality of the $\ell_\infty^2$ regularizer within the mixed $\ell_\infty^2$-$\ell_2^2$ regularization functions.</description>

      <title>Deriving Moments in the Age of Gossip Process from Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns fundamental identities in the study of age of information (AoI) in gossip networks. We recover known recursive identities for arbitrary kth moments of the age process based on the recent connection between AoI and first passage percolation. Apart from the connection to percolation, our proofs are more concise and can be followed using only elementary facts from probability. Our argument generalizes some techniques known in the statistical physics community, and we remark on connections to the Eden model.</description>

      <title>Dual Actor DDPG for Airborne STAR-RIS Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study departs from the prevailing assumption of independent Transmission and Reflection Coefficients (TRC) in Airborne Simultaneous Transmit and Reflect Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (STAR-RIS) research. Instead, we explore a novel multi-user downlink communication system that leverages a UAV-mounted STAR-RIS (Aerial-STAR) incorporating a coupled TRC phase shift model. Our key contributions include the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, active beamforming vectors at the base station, and passive RIS TRCs to enhance communication efficiency, while considering UAV energy constraints. We design the TRC as a combination of discrete and continuous actions, and propose a novel Dual Actor Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-DDPG) algorithm. The algorithm relies on two separate actor networks for high-dimensional hybrid action space. We also propose a novel harmonic mean index (HFI)-based reward function to ensure communication fairness amongst users. For comprehensive analysis, we study the impact of RIS size on UAV aerodynamics showing that it increases drag and energy demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DA-DDPG algorithm outperforms conventional DDPG and DQN-based solutions by 24% and 97%, respectively, in accumulated reward. Three-dimensional UAV trajectory optimization achieves 28% higher communication efficiency compared to two-dimensional and altitude optimization. The HFI based reward function provides 41% lower QoS denial rates as compared to other benchmarks. The mobile Aerial-STAR system shows superior performance over fixed deployed counterparts, with the coupled phase STAR-RIS outperforming dual Transmit/Reflect RIS and conventional RIS setups. These findings highlight the potential of Aerial-STAR systems and the effectiveness of our proposed DA-DDPG approach in optimizing their performance.</description>

      <title>LINC: An In-Network Coding Approach to Tame Packet Loss in Hybrid Wireless-Fiber Backbones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of ultra-low latency applications, such as financial transactions, has driven the development of hybrid backbone networks that rely on fiber, satellite, and microwave links. Despite providing low latencies, these hybrid networks suffer from occasional environmental packet loss caused by poor weather, construction, and line of sight blockage. Paradoxically, today's hybrid backbones rely on conventional transport protocols that take packet loss to signal network congestion, as opposed to transient environmental obstacles. A common approach to address this challenge is to use network coding (NC) between the end hosts to recover from these occasional packet loss events. However, current NC proposals assume full access to the end-hosts' stack to perform end-to-end encoding/decoding operations. In this paper, we introduce LINC, a novel system that provides in-network NC capabilities to mitigate environmental packet loss events without requiring cooperation from the end hosts. LINC uses a systematic block coding approach on a link-by-link basis, encoding and decoding packets inside the network. We model the tradeoff in goodput between end-to-end retransmissions and redundant packets introduced by LINC, and propose an optimization formulation to determine the optimal choice of coding parameters. Our simulations on real-world backbone topologies demonstrate that LINC reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 18% by eliminating unnecessary retransmissions.</description>

      <title>A Tight Quantum Algorithm for Multiple Collision Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for collisions in random functions is a fundamental computational problem, with many applications in symmetric and asymmetric cryptanalysis. When one searches for a single collision, the known quantum algorithms match the query lower bound. This is not the case for the problem of finding multiple collisions, despite its regular appearance as a sub-component in sieving-type algorithms.
  At EUROCRYPT 2019, Liu and Zhandry gave a query lower bound $\Omega(2^{m/3 + 2k/3})$ for finding $2^k$ collisions in a random function with m-bit output. At EUROCRYPT 2023, Bonnetain et al. gave a quantum algorithm matching this bound for a large range of $m$ and $k$, but not all admissible values. Like many previous collision-finding algorithms, theirs is based on the MNRS quantum walk framework, but it chains the walks by reusing the state after outputting a collision.
  In this paper, we give a new algorithm that tackles the remaining non-optimal range, closing the problem. Our algorithm is tight (up to a polynomial factor) in queries, and also in time under a quantum RAM assumption. The idea is to extend the chained walk to a regime in which several collisions are returned at each step, and the ``walks'' themselves only perform a single diffusion layer.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Multiuser Tracking and Signal Detection in ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the multiuser tracking and signal detection problem in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with the assistance of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Due to the diverse and high user mobility, the tracking and signal detection performance can be significantly deteriorated without choreographed user state (position and velocity) updating principle. To tackle this challenge, we manage to establish a comprehensive probabilistic signal model to characterize the interdependencies among user states, transmit signals, and received signals during the tracking procedure. Based on the Bayesian problem formulation, we further propose a novel hybrid variational message passing algorithm for the online estimation of user states, which can iteratively update the posterior probabilities of user states during each tracking frame with computational efficiency. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve both of the tracking and signal detection performance over the representative Bayesian estimation counterparts.</description>

      <title>Conditions for equality and stability in Shannon's and Tao's entropy power inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is equality in Shannon's Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) if and only if the random variables involved are Gaussian, assuming nothing beyond the existence of differential entropies. This is done by justifying de Bruijn's identity without a second moment assumption. Part of the proof also relies on a re-examination of an example of Bobkov and Chistyakov (2015), which shows that there exists a random variable $X$ with finite differential entropy $h(X),$ such that $h(X+Y) = \infty$ for any independent random variable $Y$ with finite entropy. We prove that either $X$ has this property, or $h(X+Y)$ is finite for any independent $Y$ that does not have this property. Using this, we prove the continuity of $t \mapsto h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ at $t=0$, where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is independent of $X$, under minimal assumptions. We then establish two stability results: A qualitative stability result for Shannon's EPI in terms of weak convergence under very mild moment conditions, and a quantitative stability result in Tao's discrete analogue of the EPI under log-concavity. The proof for the first stability result is based on a compactness argument, while the proof of the second uses the Cheeger inequality and leverages concentration properties of discrete log-concave distributions.</description>

      <title>PoPStat-COVID19: Leveraging Population Pyramids to Quantify Demographic Vulnerability to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how population age structure shapes COVID-19 burden is crucial for pandemic preparedness, yet common summary measures such as median age ignore key distributional features like skewness, bimodality, and the proportional weight of high-risk cohorts. We extend the PoPStat framework, originally devised to link entire population pyramids with cause-specific mortality by applying it to COVID-19. Using 2019 United Nations World Population Prospects age-sex distributions together with cumulative cases and deaths per million recorded up to 5 May 2023 by Our World in Data, we calculate PoPDivergence (the Kullback-Leibler divergence from an optimised reference pyramid) for 180+ countries and derive PoPStat-COVID19 as the Pearson correlation between that divergence and log-transformed incidence or mortality. Optimisation selects Malta's old-skewed pyramid as the reference, yielding strong negative correlations for cases (r=-0.86, p&lt;0.001, R^2=0.74) and deaths (r=-0.82, p&lt;0.001, R^2=0.67). Sensitivity tests across twenty additional, similarly old-skewed references confirm that these associations are robust to reference choice. Benchmarking against eight standard indicators like gross domestic product per capita, Gini index, Human Development Index, life expectancy at birth, median age, population density, Socio-demographic Index, and Universal Health Coverage Index shows that PoPStat-COVID19 surpasses GDP per capita, median age, population density, and several other traditional measures, and outperforms every comparator for fatality burden. PoPStat-COVID19 therefore provides a concise, distribution-aware scalar for quantifying demographic vulnerability to COVID-19.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip in Random and Bipartite Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study gossip networks where a source observing a process sends updates to an underlying graph. Nodes in the graph communicate to their neighbors by randomly sending updates. Our interest is studying the version age of information (vAoI) metric over various classes of networks. It is known that the version age of $K_n$ is logarithmic, and the version age of $\overline{K_n}$ is linear. We study the question `how does the vAoI evolve as we interpolate between $K_n$ and $\overline{K_n}$' by studying Erd\H{o}s-Reyni random graphs, random $d$-regular graphs, and bipartite networks. Our main results are proving the existence of a threshold in $G(n,p)$ from rational to logarithmic average version age, and showing $G(n,d)$ almost surely has logarithmic version age for constant $d$. We also characterize the version age of complete bipartite graphs $K_{L,R}$, when we let $L$ vary from $O(1)$ to $O(n)$.</description>

      <title>Jammer Mitigation in Absorptive RIS-Assisted Uplink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless communication systems due to its enhanced spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider an uplink NOMA system operating together with a high-dimensional absorptive reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS). We aim to minimize the total power transmitted by the users in order to meet signal-to-interference-plus-noise constraints at the base station in the presence of a jammer. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using linear programming to find the transmit powers and a fractional programming algorithm based on the Dinkelbach algorithm with a sequential convex relaxation procedure to optimize the reflection coefficients. We show that our algorithm converges on large optimization problems, with a jammer comprising as many as $64$ antennas, and an A-RIS with $128$ elements. Our numerical results show that, compared with a standard RIS that reflects all impinging energy, the A-RIS can dramatically reduce the users' required transmit power and successfully mitigate interference from the jammer. The absorption capability of the A-RIS is in particular useful in cases when the number of jammer antennas is of the same order as the number of A-RIS elements.</description>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling complex interconnected systems, hence making them particularly well-suited to address the growing challenges of next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) networks. Existing studies remain fragmented, and there is a lack of comprehensive guidance on how GNNs can be systematically applied to NG-IoT systems. As NG-IoT systems evolve toward 6G, they incorporate diverse technologies. These advances promise unprecedented connectivity, sensing, and automation but also introduce significant complexity, requiring new approaches for scalable learning, dynamic optimization, and secure, decentralized decision-making. This survey provides a comprehensive and forward-looking exploration of how GNNs can empower NG-IoT environments. We commence by exploring the fundamental paradigms of GNNs and articulating the motivation for their use in NG-IoT networks. Besides, we intrinsically connect GNNs with the family of low-density parity-check codes, modeling the NG-IoT as dynamic constrained graphs. We highlight the distinct roles of node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in tackling key challenges and demonstrate the GNNs' ability to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization. We examine the application of GNNs across core NG-enabling technologies and their integration with distributed frameworks to support privacy-preservation and distributed intelligence. We then delve into the challenges posed by adversarial attacks, offering insights into defense mechanisms. Lastly, we examine how GNNs can be integrated with emerging technologies. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of GNNs in improving efficiency, scalability, and security. Finally, we summarize the key lessons learned and outline promising future research directions, along with a set of design guidelines tailored for NG-IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Gradient-MUSIC for spectral estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Gradient-MUSIC algorithm for estimating the unknown frequencies and amplitudes of a nonharmonic signal from noisy time samples. While the classical MUSIC algorithm performs a computationally expensive search over a fine grid, Gradient-MUSIC is significantly more efficient and eliminates the need for discretization over a fine grid by using optimization techniques. It coarsely scans the 1D landscape to find initialization simultaneously for all frequencies followed by parallelizable local refinement via gradient descent. We also analyze its performance when the noise level is sufficiently small and the signal frequencies are separated by at least $8\pi/m$, where $\pi/m$ is the standard resolution of this problem. Even though the 1D landscape is nonconvex, we prove a global convergence result for Gradient-MUSIC: coarse scanning provably finds suitable initialization and gradient descent converges at a linear rate. In addition to convergence results, we also upper bound the error between the true signal frequencies and amplitudes with those found by Gradient-MUSIC. For example, if the noise has $\ell^\infty$ norm at most $\epsilon$, then the frequencies and amplitudes are recovered up to error at most $C\varepsilon/m$ and $C\varepsilon$ respectively, which are minimax optimal in $m$ and $\varepsilon$. Our theory can also handle stochastic noise with performance guarantees under nonstationary independent Gaussian noise. Our main approach is a comprehensive geometric analysis of the landscape, a perspective that has not been explored before.</description>

      <title>Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Non-Homogeneous Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Non-Homogeneous Sequential Hypothesis Testing (NHSHT), where a single active Decision-Maker (DM) selects actions with heterogeneous positive costs to identify the true hypothesis under an average error constraint \(\delta\), while minimizing expected total cost paid. Under standard arguments, we show that the objective decomposes into the product of the mean number of samples and the mean per-action cost induced by the policy. This leads to a key design principle: one should optimize the ratio of expectations (expected information gain per expected cost) rather than the expectation of per-step information-per-cost ("bit-per-buck"), which can be suboptimal. We adapt the Chernoff scheme to NHSHT, preserving its classical \(\log 1/\delta\) scaling. In simulations, the adapted scheme reduces mean cost by up to 50\% relative to the classic Chernoff policy and by up to 90\% relative to the naive bit-per-buck heuristic.</description>

      <title>The infinite information gap between mathematical and physical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial orders have been used to model several experimental setups, going from classical thermodynamics and general relativity to the quantum realm with its resource theories. In order to study such experimental setups, one typically characterizes them via a (numerical) representation, that is, a set of real-valued functions. In the context of resource theory, it is customary to use \textbf{mathematical} representations, i.e. a set of \textbf{measurement outcomes} which characterize the achievable transitions within the experimental setup. However, in line with the minimum energy and maximum entropy principles in classical mechanics and thermodynamics, respectively, one would expect an optimization interpretation for a representation to be called \textbf{physical}. More specifically, a physical representation could consist of a set of competing \textbf{optimization principles} such that a transition happens provided they are all optimized by it. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that this distinction can result in an \textbf{infinite information gap}, with some partial orders having mathematical representations that involve a finite amount of information and requiring infinite information to build a physical representation. We connect this phenomenon with well-known resource-theoretic scenarios like majorization, and develop notions of partial order dimension that run in parallel to the representations that we consider. Our results improve on the classification of preordered spaces in terms of real-valued functions.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford and parallelizable fault-tolerant logical gates on constant and almost-constant rate homological quantum LDPC codes via higher symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. A construction of constant-depth circuits of the above logical gates via cup product cohomology operation is also presented for three copies of identical toric codes on arbitrary 3-manifolds. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Perceptual Scores for Dataset Pruning in Computer Vision Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a score of an image to use for coreset selection in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced R\'enyi Entropy-Based Post-Quantum Key Agreement with Provable Security and Information-Theoretic Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced post-quantum key agreement protocol based on R\'enyi entropy, addressing vulnerabilities in the original construction while preserving information-theoretic security properties. We develop a theoretical framework leveraging entropy-preserving operations and secret-shared verification to achieve provable security against quantum adversaries. Through entropy amplification techniques and quantum-resistant commitments, the protocol establishes $2^{128}$ quantum security guarantees under the quantum random oracle model. Key innovations include a confidentiality-preserving verification mechanism using distributed polynomial commitments, tightened min-entropy bounds with guaranteed non-negativity, and composable security proofs in the quantum universal composability framework. Unlike computational approaches, our method provides information-theoretic security without hardness assumptions while maintaining polynomial complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates resilience against known quantum attack vectors, including Grover-accelerated brute force and quantum memory attacks. The protocol achieves parameterization for 128-bit quantum security with efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ communication complexity. Extensions to secure multiparty computation and quantum network applications are established, providing a foundation for long-term cryptographic security.</description>

      <title>Group-averaged Markov chains: mixing improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Markov kernels $P$ on a general state space $\mathcal{X}$, we introduce a new class of averaged Markov kernels $P_{da}(G,\nu)$ of $P$ induced by a group $G$ that acts on $\mathcal{X}$ and a probability measure $\nu$ on $G \times G$. Notable special cases are the group-orbit average $\overline{P}$, left-average $P_{la}$, right-average $P_{ra}$ and the independent-double-average $(P_{la})_{ra}$. For $\pi$-stationary $P$ in which $\pi$ is invariant with respect to $G$, we show that in general $P_{da}$ enjoys favorable convergence properties than $P$ based on metrics such as spectral gap or asymptotic variance, and within the family of $P_{da}$ the most preferable kernel is in general $(P_{la})_{ra}$. We demonstrate that $P_{la}, P_{ra}, (P_{la})_{ra}$ are comparable in terms of mixing times, which supports the use of $P_{la}, P_{ra}$ in practice as computationally cheaper alternatives over $(P_{la})_{ra}$. These averaged kernels also admit natural geometric interpretations: they emerge as unique projections of $P$ onto specific $G$-invariant structures under the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and satisfy Pythagorean identities. On the other hand, in the general case if $\pi$ is not invariant with respect to $G$, we propose and study a technique that we call state-dependent averaging of Markov kernels which generalizes the earlier results to this setting. As examples and applications, this averaging perspective not only allows us to recast state-of-the-art Markov chain samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or piecewise-deterministic Markov processes as specific cases of $P_{da}$, but also enables improvements to existing samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings, achieving rapid mixing in some toy models or when $\pi$ is the discrete uniform distribution.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Perfectly-Private Analog Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models, secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem, but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.</description>
