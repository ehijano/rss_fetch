      <title>Internal spaces of fermion and boson fields, described with the superposition of odd and even products of $\gamma^{a}$, enable understanding of all the second-quantised fields in an equivalent way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the odd and even ``basis vectors'', which are the superposition of odd and even products of $\gamma^a$'s, to describe the internal spaces of the second quantised fermion and boson fields, respectively, offers in even-dimensional spaces, like it is $d=(13+1)$, the unique description of all the properties of the observed fermion fields (quarks and leptons and antiquarks and antileptons appearing in families) and boson fields (gravitons, photons, weak bosons, gluons and scalars) in a unique way, providing that all the fields have non zero momenta only in $d =(3+1)$ of the ordinary space-time, bosons have the space index $\alpha$ (which is for tensors and vectors $\mu =(0,1,2,3)$ and for scalars $\sigma \ge 5$). In any even-dimensional space, there is the same number of internal states of fermions appearing in families and their Hermitian conjugate partners as it is of the two orthogonal groups of boson fields having the Hermitian conjugate partners within the same group. A simple action for massless fermion and boson fields describes all the fields uniquely. The paper overviews the theory, presents new achievements and discusses the open problems of this theory.</description>

      <title>From Asymptotically Flat Gravity to Finite Causal Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the phase space of the soft sector of asymptotically flat gravity in four spacetime dimensions can be identified with that of a spherically symmetric finite casual diamond in Minkowski spacetime. The leading soft graviton mode is identified with the radial fluctuation of the causal diamond size, while the Goldstone mode involves both the radial fluctuation and its symplectic partner. This allows us to relate the radial fluctuations of the causal diamond with the asymptotic transverse fluctuations parametrized by the soft modes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Diagram Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic nature of perturbative expansions in quantum field theory can arise from the factorial growth in the number of Feynman diagrams with loop order, as with instantons, or from a series of individual diagrams whose values grow factorially, as with renormalon chains in QED. Other classes of diagrams are known also to grow factorially, such as the Hopf series of graphs in $\phi^3$ theory. This Hopf series was studied using Schwinger-Dyson equations and the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees. We review the Hopf algebra approach and show that the same results can be obtained using analytic QFT techniques as with Hopf-algebraic ones. We present an efficient method to extract the asymptotic behavior and thereby generalize the analysis of the Hopf series to other classes of diagrams in other theories. We confront the question of whether these classes correspond to new types of asymptotic growth beyond instantons and renormalons, and find that they appear to be incomplete calculations of what would be renormalons in these theories if all diagrams were included. Although the Hopf algebra approach is not essential to deriving asymptotic behavior from Schwinger-Dyson equations, it does provide some other insights into quantum field theory. We therefore attempt also to provide a map between some relevant aspects of the Hopf algebra and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos, B-L Symmetry and the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider realizations of a gauged B-L symmetry in the context of the Dark Dimension scenario, where the SM lives on a codimension one brane in 5d spacetime. The B-L can naturally be a bulk gauge symmetery leading to a global symmetry on the SM brane, and have its gauge anomaly canceled by charged bulk modes. This naturally leads to the existence of 3 right-handed neutrinos propagating in the dark dimension. Allowing for Higgsing of B-L by a bulk scalar at the Higgs scale, results in a massive gauge field with $m_{B-L}\sim 100$ GeV and weak coupling $g_{B-L}\sim 10^{-10}$ which is allowed by current bounds. The model also predicts a natural matching $m_\nu\sim m_{KK}\sim\Lambda^{1/4}$, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the observed coincidence between neutrino masses and the Dark Energy scale. It also predicts a tower of sterile right-handed neutrinos in the $keV$ mass range.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that time-ordered correlation functions of a unitary CFT$_2$ in 2D Minkowski space admit a single-valued, conformally-invariant extension to the Lorentzian signature torus provided that the $S^1\times S^1$ spatial and temporal radii are equal. The result extends to Lorentzian CFT$_D$ on equal-radii $S^{D-1}\times S^1$ under the assumption that branch cuts occur only when a pair of operator insertions are null separated.</description>

      <title>Notes On de-Sitter Mellin Barnes Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we create a Mellin space method for boundary correlation functions in de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. We demonstrate that the analytic continuation between AdS${}_{d+1}$ and dS${}_{d+1}$ is encoded in a set of simple relative phases using the Mellin-Barnes representation of correlators. It helps us to determine the scalar three-point and four-point functions and their corresponding Mellin-Barnes amplitudes in dS${}_{d+1}$ space using the known results from AdS${}_{d+1}$ space. The Mellin-Barnes representation reveals the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions over all $d$ and scaling dimensions. In the present discussion, the {\it split representation} have been used as an instrumental technique in particularly the evaluation of bulk Witten diagrams and is suitable to obtain the {\it Conformal Partial Wave decomposition} of tree-level exchange in the bulk Witten diagrams. The equivalent adjustment to the cosmological three-point and four-point function of generic external scalars may be further extracted from these results, assuming the weak breakdown of the de Sitter isometries. These findings offer a step towards a more methodical comprehension of de Sitter observables utilising Mellin space techniques at the tree level and beyond.</description>

      <title>Investigating the interaction of a Cosmic String with an Accreting Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating black holes when attached to a cosmic string have their rotational energy extracted leading to a change in its spin and mass. The spin of a black hole can be measured using various methods for an accreting black hole in an X-ray binary system. Accretion disks around black holes have an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) whose location is directly dependent on spin and mass of the black hole. The orbit's location changes as the black hole's spin changes and hence can be a method to detect the presence of cosmic strings. This study investigates this change and suggests the ejection of accretion material as black hole spin approaches maximum for prograde motion and material falling into the black hole for retrograde motion, regardless of the presence of cosmic string. However, in the presence of cosmic string, the spin-up process due to accretion is found out to be slower, even with high accretion rates and is detectable. There is a transition phase that occurs as the black hole approaches maximum spin, where even small changes in spin result in significant changes in the ISCO's position. Accreting black holes attached to a large string never reach this transition phase and this absence serves as potential evidence for the existence of a cosmic string.</description>

      <title>All elastic amplitudes in the (black hole) eikonal phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we calculate the eikonal scattering amplitude for an arbitrary number of in- and out-particles, using covariant quantization in a spherical harmonics basis on the Schwarzschild background. We extend prior results to resummation over all partial waves, restoring contributions from transverse separation and correctly taking into account the particle masses in the pole structure. We consider leading order interactions mediated by scalar-scalar-graviton vertices and scalar electrodynamics. We perform our calculations in the black hole eikonal phase. The $2\to 2$ eikonal amplitude is measured by the transverse Green's function $(-\Delta_{\Omega}+a)G(\Omega,\Omega')=\delta^{(2)}(\Omega-\Omega')$. As a consistency check, we use our formalism in flat space to find an exact match with the known flat space eikonal $2\to 2$ amplitude in literature. We then extend the eikonal amplitude to arbitrarily many particles for the first time in both flat space and on the black hole background. We show that the black hole amplitude matches the black hole S-matrix as derived by 't Hooft. We conclude that this amplitude provides the most general elastic contribution one can achieve in the eikonal phase.</description>

      <title>Island of acoustic black hole in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an analogue information paradox in acoustic black holes which are emerged from the superfluid surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting acoustic black hole contains both acoustic horizons and optical horizon, with analogue Hawking radiation, i.e. phonons, emitted from the outer acoustic horizon. By using the island formula, we calculate the entanglement entropy of analogue Hawking radiation of the acoustic black hole in both non-extremal and extremal cases. In the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons follow the Page curve due to the emergence of islands, and it is approximately proportional to the area of the acoustic horizon at late time. While in the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons diverges, leading to an ill-defined Page time. Our study verifies the unitarity of the analogue gravity system, and provides further insight into the connection between the entanglement entropy and the causal structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative corrections to the Casimir energy for a scalar field theory with non-linear boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the case of a free real massive bulk scalar in D=4 dimensions, and embed two parallel plates as interfaces on which we impose non-linear boundary conditions, either Dirichlet- or Neumann-like, parameterized by a new coupling constant g. This mimics a non-Abelian gauge theory supplemented with boundary conditions on surfaces embedded in the bulk. We present the first evidence for a non-perturbative 1/g^2 boundary mass generation and its ensuing correction to the standard Casimir energy. This becomes possible by incorporating dynamical corrections to the effective boundary fields, which are used to build in the boundary conditions directly at the action level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has uncovered a connection between the symbol letters of general massless scattering and (permutations of) cluster variables of partial flag varieties. In this paper we explore the cluster adjacency of tree-level gluon amplitudes, specifically focusing on split-helicity amplitudes which can be written in closed form in terms of zigzag diagrams. We check in several cases, and conjecture in general, that the poles in each term satisfy cluster adjacency under a set of permutations that is built from arc permutations of the corresponding zigzag.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-abelian branes in curved space. We discuss solutions to the equations of motion of the transverse scalars when they are constant along the world-volume directions and obey an $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ or an $\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra. Motivated by the membrane version of the weak gravity conjecture, we specialise our results to non-abelian domain-wall D$(d-2)$ branes embedded in AdS$_d$ flux vacua. We find that they can be less self-attractive than their abelian counterpart, opening up a new decay-channel for vacua that resist all abelian domain-wall destabilisations. These branes come in two types, depending on whether their fuzziness involves the radial direction, or is purely internal. Only the latter can develop in vacua free from abelian decays. We illustrate our construction by embedding these branes in a variety of AdS vacua, destabilising some of them.</description>

Abstract: We consider the string-theory inspired Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton theory (EMMD) and show that we can derive the complete set of thermodynamic quantities of charged black holes, without having to solve for the black hole solutions. We argue that the technique can be applied more broadly to string theories, providing an accessible method for determining the thermodynamic properties of large classes of black holes for which exact solutions are typically unavailable.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization current in presence of intense Sauter field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum vacuum becomes unstable under an external field, leading to spontaneous particle-antiparticle pair creation. In canonical quantization, the time-dependent particle number, defined via Bogoliubov transformations lacks physical meaning until the external field vanishes. To address this, we explore dynamical quantities that remain well-defined at both asymptotic and intermediate times, focusing on the vacuum polarization current. Investigating this observable provides insights into the system's intermediate-time behavior. We consider pair creation in a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent, intense Sauter field. Specifically, we analyze the real and imaginary parts of the correlation function, linking them to vacuum polarization effects. The vacuum polarization current in an intense laser pulse is computed numerically, revealing that it correlates with the real part of the correlation function. Initially, the current changes sign and gradually decreases, but unlike the particle number, it does not reach a constant asymptotic value. Instead, for large times, it exhibits nearly undamped oscillations, a distinctive feature of scalar particles, oscillating strongly around zero. Additionally, we explore the uniqueness of the vacuum polarization current in the adiabatic basis, comparing different reference mode function choices. Notably, we find that the current remains independent of the basis choice.</description>

      <title>Quantum bootstrap for central potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum-mechanical bootstrap as it applies to the bound states of several central potentials in three dimensions. As part of this effort, we show how the bootstrap approach may be applied to ``non-algebraic'' potentials, such as the Yukawa potential (which asymptotically decays as an exponential) and a Gaussian potential. We additionally review the bootstrap of the Coulomb potential, demonstrate a high-precision bootstrap of the Cornell potential, and study conformal quantum mechanics. These results further recommend the bootstrap as a numerical method for high-precision calculations of ground-state physics, where applicable: for example, we are able to determine the critical coupling in the Cornell potential to better than one part in $10^7$, the most precise determination to date. Lower bounds on energies are also of high precision, occasionally one part in greater than $10^8$. Finally, we discuss the circumstances under which we are able to obtain meaningful upper bounds on ground-state energies.</description>

      <title>Magnetochiral eigenstate of the Heisenberg chain with spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to construct atypical high-energy eigenstates in quantum systems by using ground states of Hamiltonians deformed by conserved charges. For the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX chain we study a chiral Hamiltonian built from the scalar-chirality charge and total magnetization and solve it exactly by Bethe ansatz. Its ground state is a magnetized, current-carrying XXX eigenstate that breaks SU(2), time-reversal, and parity yet stays critical. This zero-entropy macrostate shows ballistic spin and chirality transport and admits realistic cold-atom and Rydberg platforms.</description>

      <title>About possible measures in Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Possible measures for Quantum Gravity are considered. Choices that are invariant under diffeomorphisms are analyzed, but the possibility of employing non invariant measures is also taken into account. The last possibility may be accepted if the anomaly in the measure is compensated by counter term redefinitions of the model under analysis. Particular attention is paid to some concrete examples of non covariant looking measures, which may be useful for generalizing the Veltmann identities when quantizing around curved space times. The results are specified for the Stelle gravity model [1]-[2], which is known to be renormalizable in flat space, although not known to be so in curved ones.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization--group and effective--action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity- motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>

      <title>Massless Majorana spinors in the Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that massive Majorana spinors \eqref{1.2} do not exist if they are $t$-dependent or $\phi$-dependent in Kerr, or Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes. For massless Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime, the Dirac equation can be separated into radial and angular equations, parameterized by two complex constants $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$. If at least one of $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ is zero, massless Majorana spinors can be solved explicitly. If $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ are nonzero, we prove the nonexistence of massless time-periodic Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime which are $L^p$ outside the event horizon for $ 0&lt;p\le\frac{6}{|\epsilon_1|+|\epsilon_2| +2}$. We then provide the Hamiltonian formulation for massless Majorana spinors and prove that the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian leads to the angular momentum $a=0$ and spacetime reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime, moreover, the massless Majorana spinor must be $\phi$-independent. Finally, we show that, in the Schwarzschild spacetime, for initial data with $L^2$ decay at infinity, the probability of the massless Majorana spinors to be in any compact region of space tends to zero as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose an experimentally viable scheme to explore the transfer of nonclassical correlations from a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to a pair of impurities immersed in it. Operating at ultra-low temperature, density fluctuations of the dipolar BEC emulate a vacuum field with Lorentz-violating dispersion, while the two impurities function as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for the BEC quasiparticles. We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking on graphs and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a cornerstone modern physics, defining a wealth of phenomena in condensed-matter and high-energy physics, and beyond. It requires an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and even then, for continuous symmetries, it only works if the spatial dimension is not too low, following the classic results of Coleman, Hohenberg, Mermin and Wagner. While usually discussed in the context of quantum and statistical field theories, and in particular, effective field theories, there are advantages in addressing the same kind of phenomena on discrete geometric structures rather than conventional manifolds. When the space is discretized into a lattice, a lucid picture of conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking springs up, with the ultraviolet issues of continuum quantum field theory out-of-sight, and the key effect, which is infrared in nature, revealed through elementary harmonic oscillator networks. From there, it is natural to generalize lattices to other graphs/networks. In this setting, the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is controlled by fractional generalizations of resistance distance and the Kirchhoff index, and most broadly by the spectral dimension. Predictably, because of richness of discrete geometric structures in comparison with continuous manifolds, a broader array of geometries emerge where spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is blocked by large fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Geometric Origin of Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate massless representations related to the extension of Poincar\`e group constructed in [1]. These representations differ from Wigner's ones of standard Poincar\`e group because the stabilizer of lightlike orbits has extra degrees of freedom. The unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of massless particles in this extension must decompose as a direct sum of a massless forward (positive zeroth component momentum) and massless backward (negative zeroth component momentum) Wigner's representations linked by internal two valued degree of freedom. We prove that these representations are unitarily equivalent to entangled states of two qubits. This provides a geometric origin of quantum entanglement for photons in the framework of quantum field theory: photons appear as superpositions of backward and forward propagating electromagnetic waves depending on a two valued parameter and this dependency gives rise to correlations between the values of local observables identical to those experienced with an entangled state of two qubits. Finally we describe an experiment capable of distinguishing the two different values of the parameter that links backward and forward massless representations providing experimental falsification of the theory.</description>

      <title>Reconciling ALP Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis through First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an axionlike particle (ALP) can simultaneously generate the baryon asymmetry and constitute dark matter through dynamics triggered by a first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT). In our proposal, the transition briefly reshapes the ALP potential via a temperature-dependent vacuum expectation value of a scalar field $S$, responsible for making the EWPT of first order, inducing a transient mass enhancement of ALP via higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operator(s). This sudden kick generates a large ALP velocity near the onset of EWPT enabling the broadening of relic satisfied parameter space and predict a complementary stochastic gravitational-wave signal from the underlying first-order transition. We further show that the same ALP dynamics can naturally fuel electroweak baryogenesis through its coupling to electroweak anomaly.</description>

      <title>Relativistic accretion process onto rotating black holes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we uncover the accretion dynamics and oscillatory behavior around rotating black holes within the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic framework by analyzing both the motion of test particles and numerically solving the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.</description>

      <title>Lattice determination of the QCD low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a non-perturbative determination of the scheme- and scale-independent low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$, appearing in the QCD effective chiral Lagrangian at next-to-leading order, by means of lattice QCD simulations with $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}=2+1$ quark flavors. We adopt staggered fermions and extract $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$ from the pion mass splitting by suitably generalizing the method introduced in [Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 074513] for the Wilson discretization. Adopting 12 gauge ensembles with 3 different values of the pion mass, and 4 different values of the lattice spacing, we are able to achieve controlled extrapolations towards the continuum, infinite volume, and chiral limits. Our final result $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}} \,\times \, 10^3 = 1.98(48)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm stat}}(26)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm syst}} = 1.98(54)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm tot}}$ agrees with and substantially improves on previous determinations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct multiplicative renormalization for the Epstein--Glaser renormalization scheme in perturbative Algebraic Quantum Field Theory: To this end, we fully combine the Connes--Kreimer renormalization framework with the Epstein--Glaser renormalization scheme. In particular, in addition to the already established position-space renormalization Hopf algebra, we also construct the renormalized Feynman rules and the counterterm map via an algebraic Birkhoff decomposition. This includes a discussion about the appropriate target algebra of regularized distributions and the renormalization scheme as a Rota--Baxter operator thereon. In particular, we show that the Hadamard singular part satisfies the Rota--Baxter property and thus relate factorization in Epstein--Glaser with multiplicativity in Connes--Kreimer. Next, we define $Z$-factors as the images of the counterterm map under the corresponding combinatorial Green's functions. This allows us to define the multiplicatively renormalized Lagrange density, for which we show that the corresponding Feynman rules are regular. Finally, we exemplify the developed theory by working out the specific case of $\phi^3_6$-theory.</description>

      <title>A rich structure of renormalization group flows for Higgs-like models in 4 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $2$ coupled Higgs doublets which transform in the usual way under SU(2)$\otimes$U(1). By constructing marginal operators which satisfy an operator product expansion based on the SU(2) Lie algebra, we can obtain a rich pattern of renormalization group (RG) flows which includes lines of fixed points and more interestingly, cyclic RG flows which are unavoidable in this model. The hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger $ with ${\cal K}$ unitary satisfying ${\cal K}^2 =1$, thus the model is non-unitary. The hamiltonian still has real eigenvalues, but the non-unitarity is manifested in negative norm states. Based on a generalized optical theorem for pseudo-hermitian hamiltonians, we show that our model is in fact unitary below the threshold for particle/anti-particle pair production. It is thus unitary in the low energy or non-relativistic limit, which opens up some potential applications to condensed matter physics. We argue that our model breaks ${\cal C} {\cal P}$ symmetry. Upon spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs-like fields have an infinite number of vacuum expectation values $v_n$ which satisfy ``Russian Doll" scaling $v_n \sim e^{2 n \lambda}$ where $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $\lambda$ is the period of one RG cycle which is an RG invariant. We speculate that this Russian Doll RG flow can perhaps resolve the so-called hierarchy problem and may shed light on the origin of ``families" in the Standard Model of particle physics. If the cyclic RG flow terminates at the electroweak scale, this could explain why there are 3 families.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that wormholes must be entangled regardless of asymptotic boundary conditions. Assuming black hole complementarity, we argue that traversable wormholes instantiate entanglement-assisted quantum channels and that this entanglement must be present between the stretched horizons as an initial condition prior to traversability.

The metric is obtained from the Petz-R\'enyi mutual information defined with input correlations computed from the continuous wavelet transform. The method is applicable to a variety of boundary QFTs that need not be conformal field theories (CFTs). For thermal free scalar and Dirac field theories the resulting bulk metric is that of (asymmetrically) warped anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. For massless, ground state CFTs the geometry simply reduces to AdS space. We show that certain parameters of the geometry can be tuned by changing the shape of the wavelet function.</description>

Abstract: We study the double cone geometry proposed by Saad, Shenker, and Stanford in de Sitter space. We demonstrate that with the inclusion of static patch observers, the double cone leads to a linear ramp consistent with random matrix behavior. This ramp arises from the relative time shift between two clocks located in opposite static patches.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

      <title>The pure spinor superparticle and 10D super-Yang-Mills amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a prescription for computing tree-level scattering amplitudes in 10D super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory using the pure spinor worldline formalism. The pure spinor formalism has proven to be a powerful framework for studying supersymmetric field theories, providing manifestly covariant and BRST-invariant formulations of amplitudes. By incorporating the worldline approach, we construct a first-quantized representation of SYM amplitudes in 10D, where interactions are encoded through the insertion of vertex operators along the particle's trajectory. We explicitly compute the N-point function, demonstrating an agreement with the limit $\alpha' \to 0$ of open superstring amplitudes and confirming that the kinematic numerators satisfy the expected BRST relations. Our results establish the pure spinor worldline formalism as a tool for studying scattering amplitudes and suggest further applications to 11D supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a pure spinor worldline formalism for computing tree-level scattering amplitudes in 11D supergravity. Focusing first on the 4-point amplitude, we demonstrate that our prescription is consistent with BRST symmetry and gauge invariance, and that the resulting expression is invariant under permutation of the external particles. Remarkably, the amplitude admits a compact representation in pure spinor superspace and agrees precisely with the result obtained via perturbiner methods. We further extend our construction to the N-point case, proposing a general correlator that preserves BRST closure and gauge invariance, thereby offering a systematic framework for higher-point computations in 11D supergravity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, an in-depth investigation of the thermodynamic relations for AdS Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is presented. This investigation is conducted within both the restricted phase space (RPS) and the conformal field theory (CFT) frameworks. The influence of non-extensive forms of entropy is also systematically examined. Our results demonstrate that the Goon-Penco (GP) relation for charged AdS black holes holds within both the RPS and CFT frameworks, irrespective of the specific form of entropy modification. The conclusion of the present study demonstrates that the GP relation constitutes a universal thermodynamic relation.</description>

      <title>Higher-Point Correlators in N=4 SYM: Generating Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct generating functions of five- and six-point correlators up to two loops at weak 't Hooft coupling in planar N=4 SYM. These generating functions unify the correlators of the lightest scalar operator in the stress-tensor multiplet with those of all higher R-charge single-trace half-BPS scalar operators, thereby extending previous results for four-point loop integrands. At the integrated level, they are represented as sums of conformal integrals with coefficients exhibiting ten-dimensional poles that combine spacetime and R-charge distances. Our results show that higher-order poles are captured by products of lower-point generating functions. We also extract new OPE data on spinning structure constants, and compare these to integrability-based computations, finding good agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, based on an analogy of holographic confining geometries and using complexified fields, we build the holographic toy model of third order photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings with gain and loss, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>

      <title>Geometric Symmetries for the Vanishing of the Black Hole Tidal Love Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric perspective on the symmetries underlying the spin 0, 1 and 2 static perturbations around a Schwarzschild black hole. In all cases, the symmetries are exact, each forming an SO(3,1) group. They can be formulated at the level of the action, provided the appropriate field variables are chosen. For spin 1 and 2, the convenient variables are certain combinations of the gauge fields for even perturbations, and dual scalars for odd perturbations. The even and odd sector each has its own SO(3,1) symmetry. In addition, there is an SO(2) symmetry connecting them, furnishing an economical description of Chandrasekhar's duality. When decomposed in spherical harmonics, the perturbations form a non-trivial representation of SO(3,1), giving rise to ladder symmetries which explain the vanishing of the tidal Love numbers. Our work builds on earlier discussions of ladder symmetries, which were formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar at the level of the Teukolsky equation. Our formulation makes it possible to state the symmetries responsible for the vanishing of the Wilson coefficients characterizing the spin 0, 1 and 2 static tidal response, in the effective point particle description of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Group Representations of Lorentz Transformations Extended to Superluminal Observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an extension of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group that includes space-time transformations for observers moving with superluminal relative velocities in arbitrary direction. This extension is generated by a realization of the Klein four group depending on polar and azimuthal angles identifying a spatial direction and is obtained with matrices representing infinite velocity limits of superluminal Lorentz boosts. The resulting group has the same identity component of the whole Lorentz group O(3,1) but involutive operators corresponding to an infinite speed boost and its negative in place of parity and time reversal. Different spatial directions in the definition of Klein group realization give rise to equivalent group extensions. We then define the extended Poincare group including translations and classify its unitary irreducible representations (UIRs). The resulting UIRs are induced from Wigner's UIRs of standard Poincare group and depend on the action of the extended Lorentz group defined on momentum space. UIRs corresponding to non lightlike orbits restrict to the ordinary Poincare subgroup as a multiplicity one direct sum of a massive forward, a massive backward and a tachyonic Wigner UIR while for lightlike orbits as two inequivalent direct sum representations combiningh linearly a forward and backward massless Wigner UIR. We then derive wave equations corresponding to solutions of the Casimir eigenvalue problem of Poincare algebra obtained differentiating the above representations. This set of equations contains all the wave equations known to date in quantum field theory together with new wave equations describing tachyonic behaviour and a new class of massless representations. We finally show that tachyonic wave functions provide a relevant representation theoretic tool for interpretation of parity violation phenomena in quantum field theory</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of the Loop Equation and Quark Confinement in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic confining area law for pure $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ Yang--Mills theory, satisfying the hierarchy of multiloop equations for arbitrary regular loops and any number of colors $N_c$. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines an effectively topological string theory where the bulk dynamics reduces to the area of a conformal map of the 2D disk, with all nontrivial dynamics encoded in the boundary loop.
  The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and a perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{\text{pert}}[C]\, e^{-\kappa S[C]}$. We show that the geometric factor $e^{-\kappa S[C]}$ is an exact multiplicative zero mode of the loop-space diffusion operator and of the full MM multiloop hierarchy for any finite $N_c$, extending the planar area law to the physical case $N_c=3$. The functional $S[C]$ obeys the inequality $S[C] \ge \sqrt{2}\,A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), providing a sufficient condition for confinement.
  The area law is given explicitly by the spectral formula $S[C] = 2\sqrt{2}\,(\lambda_3 + \lambda_4)$, using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas--Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity, and globally defined for regular loops $C \in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{R}^4)$. Matching this factor with the gluon condensate via the OPE determines the physical string tension $\kappa \sim \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^2$. This framework yields a first-principles derivation of confinement in QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We compute the complete non-planar integrand for the correlation function of four lightest scalar operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at five-loop order. This is equivalent to the super-correlator of nine stress-tensor multiplets in the self-dual theory. Starting with an ansatz of f-graphs, we impose constraints from light-cone limits, and fix the remaining freedom by using the reformulation of the theory in twistor space. We develop an efficient GPU-based algorithm for the numerical evaluation of the twistor rules. As an application, we extract the five-loop non-planar anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator. Our code and result are provided in ancillary files.</description>

Abstract: We show that a recent proposal for simulating planar hyperbolic lattices with circuit quantum electrodynamics can be extended to accommodate also higher dimensional lattices in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces if one allows for circuits with more than three polygons at each vertex. The quantum dynamics of these circuits, which can be constructed with present-day technology, are governed by effective tight-binding Hamiltonians corresponding to higher-dimensional Kagom\'{e}-like structures ($n$-dimensional zeolites), which are well known to exhibit strong frustration and flat bands. We analyze the relevant spectra of these systems and derive an exact expression for the fraction of flat-band states. Our results expand considerably the range of non-Euclidean geometry realizations with circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term ``spherons.'' This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the meson properties in the framework of an effective quark model. We start from the Bethe-Salpeter equation choosing the interaction kernel in nonlocal form with the Gaussian meson vertex function, characterized by a meson size parameter $\Lambda_H$. We demonstrate the model's predictive power by applying it to both light and heavy systems. Key results include a calculation of the $\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ decay width and the pion transition form factor $F_{\pi\gamma}(Q^2)$, which reproduces experimental data from low to high $Q^2$. We further predict the electromagnetic properties of heavy quarkonia, obtaining the two-photon decay widths of $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ and the radiative decay widths of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$, all of which show consistency with available data and other theoretical approaches. The model provides a computationally efficient and unified framework for describing mesons from the light to heavy quark sectors.</description>

      <title>Highly accurate simulations of asymmetric black-hole scattering and cross validation of effective-one-body models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dal\'{i} reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key result is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$ representing $&gt;3.7\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton. Moreover, the inferred orbital true anomalies clearly favor modified gravity over Newton with the difference of Bayesian information criterion $&gt;10$. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring and testing gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for correctness of complex Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a family of correctness conditions for complex Langevin simulations. In particular, we show that if in a given theory the expectation values of all observables within a particular space satisfy the theory's Schwinger-Dyson equations as well as certain bounds, then these expectation values are necessarily correct. In fact, these findings are not only valid in the context of complex Langevin simulations, but they also hold for general probability densities on complex manifolds, given an initial complex density on a real manifold. We stress that, while the proposed conditions are necessary and sufficient in a mathematical sense, their practical use is not to prove the correctness of obtained simulation results. Rather, they are mainly useful for detecting incorrect convergence. In particular, we test these criteria in a few simple one- and two-dimensional toy models and find that they are indeed capable of ruling out incorrect results without the need of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic domain walls on a lattice: illusive effects of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution of cosmic domain walls (DWs) settles to the scaling solution, which is often assumed to be independent of initial conditions. However, lattice simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically, its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the area parameter $\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value $\xi_{max} \approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary. Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one recognizes $\xi \approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger upon removing IR modes in simulations.</description>

      <title>Black-hole scattering with numerical relativity: Self-force extraction and post-Minkowskian validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic nature of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a clean method for comparing different approaches for modeling the two-body problem in general relativity. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code, to explore the self-force and post-Minkowskian expansions of the scattering angle. First, we use a set of unequal-mass simulations to extract the self-force contributions to the scattering angle. Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass. Next, we compare our numerical relativity results to state-of-the-art post-Minkowskian predictions at larger impact parameters than previously explored. We find good agreement in the weak-field regime and discuss the relative importance of higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>The Semiclassical limit of $SU(3)$ Gauge Field Coherent States: Peakedness and Overlap Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the heat kernel method, we construct diffeomorphism-covariant coherent states for the $SU(3)$ gauge group. We numerically demonstrate that these states exhibit the required semiclassical properties in the semiclassical limit: the peakedness property of the probability distribution and the peakedness property of the overlap function. We also provide the leading order term of the overlap amplitude in the combined limit where $t \rightarrow 0$ and $g\rightarrow g'$. This work provides the essential tool for deriving effective dynamics for $SU(3)$ gauge fields coupled to gravity via a coherent state path integral.</description>

      <title>Computing nonlinearity ratios using second order black hole perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an analytical approximation scheme for computing nonlinearity ratios involving quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs). We compute these ratios for the general case when the QQNM is not one of the linear QNMs, for the $(l,m)$ channel $(2,2) \times (2,2) \to (4,4)$. We find an excellent match with numerical simulations. We also discuss where and why the method can fail, for example, for the channel $(2,0) \times (2,0) \to (2,0)$ where we can only get crude estimates for the nonlinearity ratio. Motivated by recent studies on nonlinear ringdown at the horizon, we also compute the nonlinearity ratios at the horizon. We find that the ratio both at the horizon and infinity is insensitive to different choices of regularization of the source term in the second order perturbations. We also discuss amplitudes of QQNMs sourced by linear overtones. Finally, we discuss the issues that must be resolved within this method to do precision analysis of nonlinear ringdown.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study for Primordial Non-Gaussianity in the gravity 4D Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An inflationary model can be constrained by non-gaussian statistics as a parameter in the LSS (Large Scale Structure) distribution, and in the radiation of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) fluctuating temperature. Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $\zeta$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant in $D&lt;5$ spacetimes.</description>
