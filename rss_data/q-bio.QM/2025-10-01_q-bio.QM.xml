      <title>Behavioural Classification in C. elegans: a Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.</description>

      <title>The Multivariate SEM-PGS Model: Using Polygenic Scores to Investigate Cross-Trait Genetic Nurture and Assortative Mating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic nurture effects and assortative mating (AM) occur across many human behaviors and can bias estimates from traditional genetic models. These influences are typically studied univariately, within the same trait. However, estimation of cross-trait genetic nurture effects and cross-trait AM remains underexplored due to the absence of suitable approaches. To address this, we developed a multivariate extension of the SEM-PGS model for datasets with genotyped and phenotyped parents and offspring, enabling joint estimation of within-trait and cross-trait genetic and environmental influences. By integrating haplotypic polygenic scores (PGS) into a structural equation modeling framework, the model simultaneously estimates same-trait and cross-trait direct effects, genetic nurture, vertical transmission, and assortative mating. We also provide the first formal description of how copaths can be used to model multivariate assortative mating and derive the corresponding parameter expectations in matrix form. Forward-time Monte Carlo simulations under varying conditions of r^2_PGS and N_trio demonstrate that the model yields unbiased estimates of both within-trait and cross-trait effects when assumptions are met. The precision of estimates was adequate with large sample sizes (N_trio &gt; 16k) and improved as PGS predictive power increased. In addition, our simulation results show that failing to model cross-trait effects biases within-trait estimates, underscoring the importance of incorporating cross-trait effects. The multivariate SEM-PGS model offers a powerful and flexible tool for disentangling gene-environment interplay and advancing the understanding of familial influences on human traits.</description>

      <title>Learning Inter-Atomic Potentials without Explicit Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.</description>

      <title>Latent Representation Learning from 3D Brain MRI for Interpretable Prediction in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present InfoVAE-Med3D, a latent-representation learning approach for 3D brain MRI that targets interpretable biomarkers of cognitive decline. Standard statistical models and shallow machine learning often lack power, while most deep learning methods behave as black boxes. Our method extends InfoVAE to explicitly maximize mutual information between images and latent variables, producing compact, structured embeddings that retain clinically meaningful content. We evaluate on two cohorts: a large healthy-control dataset (n=6527) with chronological age, and a clinical multiple sclerosis dataset from Charles University in Prague (n=904) with age and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) scores. The learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression, preserve key medical attributes, and form intuitive clusters that aid interpretation. Across reconstruction and downstream prediction tasks, InfoVAE-Med3D consistently outperforms other VAE variants, indicating stronger information capture in the embedding space. By uniting predictive performance with interpretability, InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in neurological disease.</description>

      <title>Revealing the temporal dynamics of antibiotic anomalies in the infant gut microbiome with neural jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in irregularly sampled multi-variate time-series is challenging, especially in data-scarce settings. Here we introduce an anomaly detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates, and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.</description>

      <title>Neural Diffusion Processes for Physically Interpretable Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Federated Few-Shot Rare-Disease Diagnosis with Energy-Aware Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i) few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10% improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore, privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems. The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the deterministic models with equivalent architecture.</description>

      <title>Compositional amortized inference for large-scale hierarchical Bayesian models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) has emerged as a powerful simulation-based approach for estimating complex mechanistic models, offering fast posterior sampling via generative neural networks. However, extending ABI to hierarchical models, a cornerstone of modern Bayesian analysis, remains a major challenge due to the need to simulate massive data sets and estimate thousands of parameters. In this work, we build on compositional score matching (CSM), a divide-and-conquer strategy for Bayesian updating using diffusion models. To address existing stability issues of CSM in dealing with large data sets, we couple adaptive solvers with a novel, error-damping compositional estimator. Our estimator remains stable even with hundreds of thousands of data points and parameters. We validate our approach on a controlled toy example, a high-dimensional autoregressive model, and a real-world advanced microscopy application involving over 750,000 parameters.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Relations for Active Undulators in Overdamped Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organisms that locomote by propagating waves of body bending can maintain performance across heterogeneous environments by modifying their gait frequency $\omega$ or wavenumber $k$. We identify a unifying relationship between these parameters for overdamped undulatory swimmers (including nematodes, spermatozoa, and mm-scale fish) moving in diverse environmental rheologies, in the form of an active `dispersion relation' $\omega\propto k^{\pm2}$. A model treating the organisms as actively driven viscoelastic beams reproduces the experimentally observed scaling. The relative strength of rate-dependent dissipation in the body and the environment determines whether $k^2$ or $k^{-2}$ scaling is observed. The existence of these scaling regimes reflects the $k$ and $\omega$ dependence of the various underlying force terms and how their relative importance changes with the external environment and the neuronally commanded gait.</description>

      <title>From reductionism to realism: Holistic mathematical modelling for complex biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At its core, the physics paradigm adopts a reductionist approach, aiming to understand fundamental phenomena by decomposing them into simpler, elementary processes. While this strategy has been tremendously successful in physics, it has often fallen short in addressing fundamental questions in the biological sciences. This arises from the inherent complexity of biological systems, characterised by heterogeneity, polyfunctionality and interactions across spatiotemporal scales. Nevertheless, the traditional framework of complex systems modelling falls short, as its emphasis on broad theoretical principles has often failed to produce predictive, empirically-grounded insights. To advance towards actionable mathematical models in biology, we argue, using neuroscience as a case study, that it is necessary to move beyond reductionist approaches and instead embrace the complexity of biological systems - leveraging the growing availability of high-resolution data and advances in high-performance computing. We advocate for a holistic mathematical modelling paradigm that harnesses rich representational structures such as annotated and multilayer networks, employs agent-based models and simulation-based approaches, and focuses on the inverse problem of inferring system dynamics from observations. We emphasise that this approach is fully compatible with the search for fundamental biophysical principles, and highlight the potential it holds to drive progress in mathematical biology over the next two decades.</description>

      <title>Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.</description>
