      <title>A systemic and cybernetic perspective on causality, big data and social networks in tourism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a mathematical model to determine invariant sets, set covering, orbits and, in particular, attractors in the set of tourism variables. Analysis was carried out based on an algorithm and applying an interpretation of chaos theory developed in the context of General Systems Theory and Big Data. Design/methodology/approach - Tourism is one of the most digitalized sectors of the economy, and social networks are an important source of data for information gathering. However, the high levels of redundant information on the Web and the appearance of contradictory opinions and facts produce undesirable effects that must be cross-checked against real data. This paper sets out the causal relationships associated with tourist flows to enable the formulation of appropriate strategies. Findings - The results can be applied to numerous cases, for example, in the analysis of tourist flows, these findings can be used to determine whether the behaviour of certain groups affects that of other groups, as well as analysing tourist behaviour in terms of the most relevant variables. Originality/value - The technique presented here breaks with the usual treatment of the tourism topics. Unlike statistical analyses that merely provide information on current data, the authors use orbit analysis to forecast, if attractors are found, the behaviour of tourist variables in the immediate future.</description>

      <title>Synchronization between media followers and political supporters during an election process: towards a real time study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the dynamics of discussions in Twitter (before it became X) among supporters of various candidates in the 2022 French presidential election, and followers of different types of media. Our study demonstrates that we can automatically detect the synchronization of interest among different groups around specific topics at particular times.
  We introduce two complementary methods for constructing dynamic semantic networks, each with its own advantages. The growing aggregated network helps identify the reactivation of past topics, while the rolling window network is more sensitive to emerging discussions that, despite their significance, may appear suddenly and have a short lifespan. These two approaches offer distinct perspectives on the discussion landscape. Rather than choosing between them, we advocate for using both, as their comparison provides valuable insights at a relatively low computational and storage cost. Our findings confirm and quantify, on a larger scale and in an automatic, agnostic manner, observations previously made using more qualitative methods. We believed this work represents a step forward in developing methodologies to assess equity in information treatment, an obligation imposed by law on broadcasters that use broadcast spectrum frequencies in certain countries.</description>

      <title>An Approximate-Master-Equation Formulation of the Watts Threshold Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks, researchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals. However, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more individuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study dynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur between any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model (WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very recently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to polyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their discrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations (AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy. We then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled differential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much lower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically and is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and calculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large spreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of a French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships. We find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these empirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates structural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the dynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Invisible Walls in Cities: Leveraging Large Language Models to Predict Urban Segregation Experience with Social Media Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding experienced segregation in urban daily life is crucial for addressing societal inequalities and fostering inclusivity. The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy.Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness.Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the temporal dynamics of linguistic features contained in misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consumption of misinformation can lead to negative consequences that impact the individual and society. To help mitigate the influence of misinformation on human beliefs, algorithmic labels providing context about content accuracy and source reliability have been developed. Since the linguistic features used by algorithms to estimate information accuracy can change across time, it is important to understand their temporal dynamics. As a result, this study uses natural language processing to analyze PolitiFact statements spanning between 2010 and 2024 to quantify how the sources and linguistic features of misinformation change between five-year time periods. The results show that statement sentiment has decreased significantly over time, reflecting a generally more negative tone in PolitiFact statements. Moreover, statements associated with misinformation realize significantly lower sentiment than accurate information. Additional analysis shows that recent time periods are dominated by sources from online social networks and other digital forums, such as blogs and viral images, that contain high levels of misinformation containing negative sentiment. In contrast, most statements during early time periods are attributed to individual sources (i.e., politicians) that are relatively balanced in accuracy ratings and contain statements with neutral or positive sentiment. Named-entity recognition was used to identify that presidential incumbents and candidates are relatively more prevalent in statements containing misinformation, while US states tend to be present in accurate information. Finally, entity labels associated with people and organizations are more common in misinformation, while accurate statements are more likely to contain numeric entity labels, such as percentages and dates.</description>

      <title>Value of Information in Social Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study extends Blackwell's (1953) comparison of information to a sequential social learning model, where agents make decisions sequentially based on both private signals and the observed actions of others. In this context, we introduce a new binary relation over information structures: An information structure is more socially valuable than another if it yields higher expected payoffs for all agents, regardless of their preferences. First, we establish that this binary relation is strictly stronger than the Blackwell order. Then, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for our binary relation and propose a simpler sufficient condition that is easier to verify.</description>

      <title>Towards democratic data agency: Attitudes and concerns about online data practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal widespread concern and increasing lack of understanding about how personal data is collected, shared, and used online without consent. This issue is compounded by limited options available for digital citizens to understand, control and manage their data flows across platforms, underscoring the need to explore how this lack of trust and transparency affects citizens' data practices including their capacities to act in a modern knowledge society. Despite the promising research within this field, important demographics are often overlooked, particularly people from marginalized social groups such as elderly, socially and economically challenged communities, and younger participants. This paper addresses this gap by specifically focusing on these underrepresented groups, emphasizing the need for exploring their understandings and percepts of online data practices. Drawing on three semi-structured focus group interviews, the paper asks: to what extent can public attitudes and concerns about data sharing on the internet inform the potential strategies and frameworks necessary to enhance digital trust and democratic data agency particularly among marginalized groups in Denmark? The study explores the types of information, levels of transparency, and agency people desire in their daily online data practices. Additionally, it explores how these insights can potentially inform the future development of fair data strategies and technological approaches to enhance digital trust and democratic data agency. Key findings point out the need for transparent, accessible privacy policies and data management tools, emphasizing that transparency alone is insufficient without enhancing democratic agency to address trust issues and foster a more inclusive digital environment.

      <title>A Comparative Study of How People With and Without ADHD Recognise and Avoid Dark Patterns on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark patterns are deceptive strategies that recent work in human-computer interaction (HCI) has captured throughout digital domains, including social networking sites (SNSs). While research has identified difficulties among people to recognise dark patterns effectively, few studies consider vulnerable populations and their experience in this regard, including people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who may be especially susceptible to attention-grabbing tricks. Based on an interactive web study with 135 participants, we investigate SNS users' ability to recognise and avoid dark patterns by comparing results from participants with and without ADHD. In line with prior work, we noticed overall low recognition of dark patterns with no significant differences between the two groups. Yet, ADHD individuals were able to avoid specific dark patterns more often. Our results advance previous work by understanding dark patterns in a realistic environment and offer insights into their effect on vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Improving Hate Speech Classification with Cross-Taxonomy Dataset Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic hate speech detection faces significant challenges due to the diverse definitions and datasets used in research and practice. Social media platforms, legal frameworks, and institutions each apply distinct yet overlapping definitions, complicating classification efforts. This study addresses these challenges by demonstrating that existing datasets and taxonomies can be integrated into a unified model, enhancing prediction performance and reducing reliance on multiple specialized classifiers. The work introduces a universal taxonomy and a hate speech classifier capable of detecting a wide range of definitions within a single framework. Our approach is validated by combining two widely used but differently annotated datasets, showing improved classification performance on an independent test set. This work highlights the potential of dataset and taxonomy integration in advancing hate speech detection, increasing efficiency, and ensuring broader applicability across contexts.</description>

      <title>PoSSUM: A Protocol for Surveying Social-media Users with Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PoSSUM, an open-source protocol for unobtrusive polling of social-media users via multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). PoSSUM leverages users' real-time posts, images, and other digital traces to create silicon samples that capture information not present in the LLM's training data. To obtain representative estimates, PoSSUM employs Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MrP) with structured priors to counteract the observable selection biases of social-media platforms. The protocol is validated during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, for which five PoSSUM polls were conducted and published on GitHub and X. In the final poll, fielded October 17-26 with a synthetic sample of 1,054 X users, PoSSUM accurately predicted the outcomes in 50 of 51 states and assigned the Republican candidate a win probability of 0.65. Notably, it also exhibited lower state-level bias than most established pollsters. These results demonstrate PoSSUM's potential as a fully automated, unobtrusive alternative to traditional survey methods.</description>

      <title>Identification and explanation of disinformation in wiki data streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms, increasingly used as news sources for varied data analytics, have transformed how information is generated and disseminated. However, the unverified nature of this content raises concerns about trustworthiness and accuracy, potentially negatively impacting readers' critical judgment due to disinformation. This work aims to contribute to the automatic data quality validation field, addressing the rapid growth of online content on wiki pages. Our scalable solution includes stream-based data processing with feature engineering, feature analysis and selection, stream-based classification, and real-time explanation of prediction outcomes. The explainability dashboard is designed for the general public, who may need more specialized knowledge to interpret the model's prediction. Experimental results on two datasets attain approximately 90 % values across all evaluation metrics, demonstrating robust and competitive performance compared to works in the literature. In summary, the system assists editors by reducing their effort and time in detecting disinformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on social bots aims at advancing knowledge and providing solutions to one of the most debated forms of online manipulation. Yet, social bot research is plagued by widespread biases, hyped results, and misconceptions that set the stage for ambiguities, unrealistic expectations, and seemingly irreconcilable findings. Overcoming such issues is instrumental towards ensuring reliable solutions and reaffirming the validity of the scientific method. In this contribution, we review some recent results in social bots research, highlighting and revising factual errors as well as methodological and conceptual biases. More importantly, we demystify common misconceptions, addressing fundamental points on how social bots research is discussed. Our analysis surfaces the need to discuss research about online disinformation and manipulation in a rigorous, unbiased, and responsible way. This article bolsters such effort by identifying and refuting common fallacious arguments used by both proponents and opponents of social bots research, as well as providing directions toward sound methodologies for future research in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a refined graph encoder embedding method, enhancing the original graph encoder embedding through linear transformation, self-training, and hidden community recovery within observed communities. We provide the theoretical rationale for the refinement procedure, demonstrating how and why our proposed method can effectively identify useful hidden communities under stochastic block models. Furthermore, we show how the refinement method leads to improved vertex embedding and better decision boundaries for subsequent vertex classification. The efficacy of our approach is validated through numerical experiments, which exhibit clear advantages in identifying meaningful latent communities and improved vertex classification across a collection of simulated and real-world graph data.</description>

      <title>AgileRate: Bringing Adaptivity and Robustness to DeFi Lending Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized lending by replacing intermediaries with algorithm-driven liquidity pools. However, existing platforms like Aave and Compound rely on static interest rate curves and collateral requirements that struggle to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to inefficiencies in utilization and increased risks of liquidations. In this work, we propose a dynamic model of the lending market based on evolving demand and supply curves, alongside an adaptive interest rate controller that responds in real-time to shifting market conditions. Using a Recursive Least Squares algorithm, our controller tracks the external market and achieves stable utilization, while also controlling default and liquidation risk. We provide theoretical guarantees on the interest rate convergence and utilization stability of our algorithm. We establish bounds on the system's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation compared to static curves, while quantifying the trade-off between adaptivity and adversarial robustness. We propose two complementary approaches to mitigating adversarial manipulation: an algorithmic method that detects extreme demand and supply fluctuations and a market-based strategy that enhances elasticity, potentially via interest rate derivative markets. Our dynamic curve demand/supply model demonstrates a low best-fit error on Aave data, while our interest rate controller significantly outperforms static curve protocols in maintaining optimal utilization and minimizing liquidations.</description>
