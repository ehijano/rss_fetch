      <title>The Frictional Brachistochrone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, I construct an elegant frictional brachistochrone for a mass point motion of a granular material with the Coulomb frictional energy dissipation that inherently includes the evolving path curvature. The simple model reveals several striking mechanical phenomena. It is applicable to any frictional particle. With increasing friction, the particle path becomes less and less curved until a straight brachistochrone is attained in the limit of sufficiently high friction. The existence of the straight-brachistochrone is phenomenal.</description>

      <title>Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) for Improving Accuracy of Model Prediction and Scientific Understanding of Soil Organic Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big data and the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of the global carbon cycle and other biogeochemical processes. However, retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data remains a challenge. Here, we develop a Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) that seamlessly integrates a vectorized process-based soil carbon cycle model (i.e., Community Land Model version 5, CLM5) into a neural network (NN) structure to examine mechanisms governing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage from big data. BINN demonstrates high accuracy in retrieving biogeochemical parameter values from synthetic data in a parameter recovery experiment. We use BINN to predict six major processes regulating the soil carbon cycle (or components in process-based models) from 25,925 observed SOC profiles across the conterminous US and compared them with the same processes previously retrieved by a Bayesian inference-based PROcess-guided deep learning and DAta-driven modeling (PRODA) approach (Tao et al. 2020; 2023). The high agreement between the spatial patterns of the retrieved processes using the two approaches with an average correlation coefficient of 0.81 confirms BINN's ability in retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data. Additionally, the integration of neural networks and process-based models in BINN improves computational efficiency by more than 50 times over PRODA. We conclude that BINN is a transformative tool that harnesses the power of both AI and process-based modeling, facilitation new scientific discoveries while improving interpretability and accuracy of Earth system models.</description>

      <title>Poststack Seismic Data Preconditioning via Dynamic Guided Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data preconditioning is essential for subsurface interpretation. It enhances signal quality while attenuating noise, improving the accuracy of geophysical tasks that would otherwise be biased by noise. Although classical poststack seismic data enhancement methods can effectively reduce noise, they rely on predefined statistical distributions, which often fail to capture the complexity of seismic noise. On the other hand, deep learning methods offer an alternative but require large and diverse data sets. Typically, static databases are used for training, introducing domain bias, and limiting adaptability to new noise poststack patterns. This work proposes a novel two-process dynamic training method to overcome these limitations. Our method uses a dynamic database that continuously generates clean and noisy patches during training to guide the learning of a supervised enhancement network. This dynamic-guided learning workflow significantly improves generalization by introducing variability into the training data. In addition, we employ a domain adaptation via a neural style transfer strategy to address the potential challenge of encountering unknown noise domains caused by specific geological configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on both synthetic and field data, within and outside the training domain, eliminating reliance on known statistical distributions and enhancing adaptability across diverse data sets of poststack data.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Unique Geochemical Fingerprints of Omo Group Beds around Lake Turkana, Kenya by Modified Gaussian Discrimination Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modified Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) is used with an optimal search strategy to identify the unique geochemical fingerprints of six different geological beds in the Lake Turkana area. Three-hundred samples were collected from six different beds in the Omo Group of Lake Turkana, where each sample consisted of the PPMs of 11 different chemical compound. The GDA analysis discovered a unique combination of three tuff compounds that can uniquely identify one of the five beds, where a 6th bed is excluded because only 7 samples were collected from it. These geochemical fingerprints are important because any Turkana hominin fossil in the Omo Group can now be efficiently identified by matching the geochemical fingerprint of a fossil's host rock to the fingerprint of the bed in which it is found. In general, the GDA search strategy can be a powerful tool for efficiently identifying unique class fingerprints of high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>A generative foundation model for an all-in-one seismic processing framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data often face challenges in their utilization due to noise contamination, incomplete acquisition, and limited low-frequency information, which hinder accurate subsurface imaging and interpretation. Traditional processing methods rely heavily on task-specific designs to address these challenges and fail to account for the variability of data. To address these limitations, we present a generative seismic foundation model (GSFM), a unified framework based on generative diffusion models (GDMs), designed to tackle multi-task seismic processing challenges, including denoising, backscattered noise attenuation, interpolation, and low-frequency extrapolation. GSFM leverages a pre-training stage on synthetic data to capture the features of clean, complete, and broadband seismic data distributions and applies an iterative fine-tuning strategy to adapt the model to field data. By adopting a target-oriented diffusion process prediction, GSFM improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Synthetic data tests demonstrate GSFM surpasses benchmarks with equivalent architectures in all tasks and achieves performance comparable to traditional pre-training strategies, even after their fine-tuning. Also, field data tests suggest that our iterative fine-tuning approach addresses the generalization limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms, delivering significantly enhanced performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, GSFM's inherent probabilistic nature enables effective uncertainty quantification, offering valuable insights into the reliability of processing results.</description>

      <title>Intraseasonal atmospheric variability under climate trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-order climate models can play an important role in understanding low-frequency variability in the atmospheric circulation and how forcing consistent with anthropogenic climate change may affect this variability. Here, we study a conceptual model of the mid-latitudes' atmospheric circulation from the perspective of nonautonomous dynamical systems. First, a bifurcation analysis is carried out under time-independent forcing in order to identify different types of behavior in the autonomous model's parameter space. Next, we focus on the study of the nonautonomous system in which the cross-latitudinal heat flux varies seasonally, according to insolation changes. The forward attractor of the seasonally forced model is compared with the attractor of the autonomous one. The seasonal forcing results in a clear change of the attractor's shape. The summer attractor loses its periodicity, and hence predictability, when the forcing is seasonal, while the winter attractor favors energy transport through one of the model's two wave components. Climate change forcing produces several remarkable effects. Thus, the analysis of the model's snapshot attractor under climate trends suggests that the jet speed does not always follow the sign of the change in equator-to-pole thermal contrast, while the change in the energy transported by the eddies does. Chaotic behavior can be completely suppressed in favor of a regular periodic one and vice-versa. Circulation patterns can change, suddenly disappear, and rebuild. The model's snapshot attractor proves to be a robust tool to study its changes in internal variability due to climate trends, both positive and negative.</description>

      <title>Origin of slow earthquake statistics in low-friction soft granular shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow earthquakes differ from regular earthquakes in their slower moment release and limited size distribution. What mechanisms cause slow earthquakes that manifest these unique statistics? We experimentally demonstrate that their characteristics emerge from low-friction soft granular shear. Using a hydrogel particle layer floated on lubricating fluid, we conducted stick-slip experiments. The observed slip events follow the same laws of both moment release rate and size distribution as slow earthquakes, contrasting with frictional rigid granular shear. Slip size is determined by the competing effects of shear localization and pressure enhancement with decreasing porosity. These findings indicate that low friction and particle softness in sheared granular systems with monotonous structures cause slow earthquake statistics, which may monitor pore fluid dynamics and shear localization within hazardous fault zones.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency wavefield solutions for variable velocity models using meta-learning enhanced low-rank physics-informed neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) face significant challenges in modeling multi-frequency wavefields in complex velocity models due to their slow convergence, difficulty in representing high-frequency details, and lack of generalization to varying frequencies and velocity scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Meta-LRPINN, a novel framework that combines low-rank parameterization using singular value decomposition (SVD) with meta-learning and frequency embedding. Specifically, we decompose the weights of PINN's hidden layers using SVD and introduce an innovative frequency embedding hypernetwork (FEH) that links input frequencies with the singular values, enabling efficient and frequency-adaptive wavefield representation. Meta-learning is employed to provide robust initialization, improving optimization stability and reducing training time. Additionally, we implement adaptive rank reduction and FEH pruning during the meta-testing phase to further enhance efficiency. Numerical experiments, which are presented on multi-frequency scattered wavefields for different velocity models, demonstrate that Meta-LRPINN achieves much fast convergence speed and much high accuracy compared to baseline methods such as Meta-PINN and vanilla PINN. Also, the proposed framework shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution frequencies while maintaining computational efficiency. These results highlight the potential of our Meta-LRPINN for scalable and adaptable seismic wavefield modeling.</description>

      <title>Coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical tide consists of various waves that can resonate with orbital motion. We test this coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion using a simple two-dimensional shallow water model, which can be applied to a rocky planet covered with thin ocean or atmosphere. Then we take the earth-moon system as a fiducial model to calculate the tidal resonances and orbital evolution. We find that tidal dissipation can even increase with increasing orbital separation because of the coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion. We draw the conclusion that the coupling is not negligible to study the orbital evolution on secular timescale.</description>

      <title>Filling the gap in the IERS C01 polar motion series in 1858.9-1860.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The C01 Earth orientation parameters (EOP) series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is the longest reliable record of the Earth's rotation. In particular, the polar motion (PM) series beginning from 1846 provides a basis for investigation of the long-term PM variations. However, the pole coordinate $Y_p$ in the IERS C01 PM series has a 2-year gap, which makes this series not completely evenly spaced. This paper presents the results of the first attempt to overcome this problem and discusses some ways to fill this gap. Two novel approaches were considered for this purpose: parametric astronomical model consisting of the bias and the Chandler and annual wobbles with linearly changing amplitudes, and data-driven model based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Both methods were tested with various options to ensure robust and reliable results. The results obtained by the two methods generally agree within the $Y_p$ errors in the IERS C01 series, but the results obtained by the SSA approach can be considered preferable because it is based on a more complete PM model.</description>
