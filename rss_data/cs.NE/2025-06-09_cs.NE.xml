      <title>Preprocessing Methods for Memristive Reservoir Computing for Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors, RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6% while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.</description>

      <title>Integer Binary-Range Alignment Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs, achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6% and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by 6.3${\times}$.</description>

      <title>Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary NAS for Multiclass Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) is a key part of evolutionary machine learning, which commonly utilizes evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to automatically design high-performing deep neural architectures. During past years, various ENAS methods have been proposed with exceptional performance. However, the theory research of ENAS is still in the infant. In this work, we step for the runtime analysis, which is an essential theory aspect of EAs, of ENAS upon multiclass classification problems. Specifically, we first propose a benchmark to lay the groundwork for the analysis. Furthermore, we design a two-level search space, making it suitable for multiclass classification problems and consistent with the common settings of ENAS. Based on both designs, we consider (1+1)-ENAS algorithms with one-bit and bit-wise mutations, and analyze their upper and lower bounds on the expected runtime. We prove that the algorithm using both mutations can find the optimum with the expected runtime upper bound of $O(rM\ln{rM})$ and lower bound of $\Omega(rM\ln{M})$. This suggests that a simple one-bit mutation may be greatly considered, given that most state-of-the-art ENAS methods are laboriously designed with the bit-wise mutation. Empirical studies also support our theoretical proof.</description>

      <title>Integrating Complexity and Biological Realism: High-Performance Spiking Neural Networks for Breast Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) event-driven nature enables efficient encoding of spatial and temporal features, making them suitable for dynamic time-dependent data processing. Despite their biological relevance, SNNs have seen limited application in medical image recognition due to difficulties in matching the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose a novel breast cancer classification approach that combines SNNs with Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) a computationally efficient measure of sequence complexity. LZC enhances the interpretability and accuracy of spike-based models by capturing structural patterns in neural activity. Our study explores both biophysical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neuron models under supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid learning regimes. Experiments were conducted on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using numerical features derived from medical imaging. LB-based models consistently exceeded 90.00% accuracy, while LIF-based models reached over 85.00%. The highest accuracy of 98.25% was achieved using an ANN-to-SNN conversion method applied to both neuron models comparable to traditional deep learning with back-propagation, but at up to 100 times lower computational cost. This hybrid approach merges deep learning performance with the efficiency and plausibility of SNNs, yielding top results at lower computational cost. We hypothesize that the synergy between temporal-coding, spike-sparsity, and LZC-driven complexity analysis enables more-efficient feature extraction. Our findings demonstrate that SNNs combined with LZC offer promising, biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural networks in medical diagnostics, particularly for resource-constrained or real-time systems.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive precision modulation of high-level neural population activity via natural vision perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.</description>

      <title>AutoQD: Automatic Discovery of Diverse Behaviors with Quality-Diversity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific knowledge.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Representation and Learning in Genetic Programming: the LaSER Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genetic Programming (GP) has traditionally entangled the evolution of symbolic representations with their performance-based evaluation, often relying solely on raw fitness scores. This tight coupling makes GP solutions more fragile and prone to overfitting, reducing their ability to generalize. In this work, we propose LaSER (Latent Semantic Representation Regression)} -- a general framework that decouples representation evolution from lifetime learning. At each generation, candidate programs produce features which are passed to an external learner to model the target task. This approach enables any function approximator, from linear models to neural networks, to serve as a lifetime learner, allowing expressive modeling beyond conventional symbolic forms.
  Here we show for the first time that LaSER can outcompete standard GP and GP followed by linear regression when it employs non-linear methods to fit coefficients to GP-generated equations against complex data sets. Further, we explore how LaSER enables the emergence of innate representations, supporting long-standing hypotheses in evolutionary learning such as the Baldwin Effect. By separating the roles of representation and adaptation, LaSER offers a principled and extensible framework for symbolic regression and classification.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Policies for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods leverage previous experiences to learn better policies than the behavior policy used for data collection. However, they face challenges handling distribution shifts due to the lack of online interaction during training. To this end, we propose a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP) that incorporates state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our method promotes learning of generalizable state representation to alleviate the distribution shift caused by OOD states. To illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP, we design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment and realize it on a 6-DoF real-world UR10 robot, as well as in simulation, and compare its performance with prior algorithms. In particular, we show the importance of the proposed state reconstruction via ablation studies. In addition, we assess the performance of our model on standard continuous control benchmarks (D4RL), namely the navigation of an 8-DoF ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving state-of-the-art results. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can achieve 167% improvement over the competing baseline on a sparse continuous control navigation task where various regions of the state space are removed from the offline RL dataset, including the region encapsulating the goal.</description>

      <title>The Influence of the Memory Capacity of Neural DDEs on the Universal Approximation Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying the memory capacity is the product $K \tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation property. We show that if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently small, the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE. Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by increasing the memory capacity $K\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of DDEs with positive delay $\tau&gt;0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory threshold, universal approximation holds.</description>
