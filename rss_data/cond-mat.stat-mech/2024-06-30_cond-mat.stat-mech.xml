      <title>Optimal time estimation and the clock uncertainty relation for stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time estimation is a fundamental task that underpins precision measurement, global navigation systems, financial markets, and the organisation of everyday life. Many biological processes also depend on time estimation by nanoscale clocks, whose performance can be significantly impacted by random fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the problem of optimal time estimation for Markovian stochastic processes, and present its general solution in the asymptotic (long-time) limit. Specifically, we obtain a tight upper bound on the precision of any time estimate constructed from sustained observations of a classical, Markovian jump process. This bound is controlled by the mean residual time, i.e. the expected wait before the first jump is observed. As a consequence, we obtain a universal bound on the signal-to-noise ratio of arbitrary currents and counting observables in the steady state. This bound is similar in spirit to the kinetic uncertainty relation but provably tighter, and we explicitly construct the counting observables that saturate it. Our results establish ultimate precision limits for an important class of observables in non-equilibrium systems, and demonstrate that the mean residual time, not the dynamical activity, is the measure of freneticity that tightly constrains fluctuations far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Ice on curved surfaces: defect rings and differential local dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice systems are prototypes of locally constrained dynamics. This is exemplified in Coulomb-liquid phases where a large space of configurations is sampled, each satisfying local ice rules. Dynamics proceeds through `flipping' rings, i.e., through reversing arrows running along the edges of a polygon. We examine the role of defect rings in such phases, with square-ice as a testing ground. When placed on a curved surface, the underlying square lattice will form defects such as triangles or pentagons. We show that triangular defects are statistically more `flippable' than the background. In contrast, pentagons and larger polygons are less flippable. In fact, flippability decreases monotonically with ring size, as seen from a Pauling-like argument. As an explicit demonstration, we wrap the square ice model on a sphere. We start from an octahedron and perform repeated rectifications, producing a series of clusters with sphere-like geometry. They contain a fixed number of defect triangles in an otherwise square lattice. We numerically enumerate all ice-rule-satisfying configurations. Indeed, triangles are flippable in a larger fraction of configurations than quadrilaterals. The obtained flippabilities are in broad agreement with the Pauling-like estimates. As a minimal model for dynamics, we construct a Hamiltonian with quantum tunnelling terms that flip rings. The resulting ground state is a superposition of all ice configurations. The dominant contribution to its energy comes from localized resonance within triangles. Our results suggest local dynamics as a promising observable for experiments in spin ice and artificial ice systems. They also point to hierarchical dynamics in materials such as ice V that contain rings of multiple sizes.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for Markovian systems based on coarse-grained observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most experiments can only detect a set of coarse-grained clusters of a molecular system, while the internal microstates are often inaccessible. Here, based on a sufficient long coarse-grained trajectory, we obtain a set of sufficient statistics which extracts all statistic information of coarse-grained observations. Based on these sufficient statistics, we completely solve the problems of parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for a general Markovian system with an arbitrary number of microstates and arbitrary coarse-grained partitioning. Our nonequilibrium criterion generalizes the one obtained in [J. Chem. Phys. 132:041102 (2010)] for a three-state system with two coarse-grained clusters, and is much superior to the classical criterion based on autocorrelation functions.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Transfers in Domain Growth Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain growth process, small structures gradually vanish, leaving behind larger ones. We investigate spectral energy transfers in two standard models for domain growth: (a) the {\it Cahn-Hilliard} (CH) equation with conserved dynamics, and (b) the {\it time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau} (TDGL) equation with non-conserved dynamics. The nonlinear terms in these equations dissipate fluctuations and facilitate energy transfers among Fourier modes. In the TDGL equation, only the $\phi(\mathbf{k} = 0, t)$ mode survives, and the order parameter $\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$ approaches a uniform state with $\phi = +1$ or $-1$. On the other hand, there is no dynamics of the $\phi(\mathbf{k} = 0, t)$ mode in the CH equation due to the conservation law, highlighting the different dynamics of these equations.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Quantum Reaction-Diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss many-body fermionic and bosonic systems subject to dissipative particle losses in arbitrary spatial dimensions $d$, within the Keldysh path-integral formulation of the quantum master equation. This open quantum dynamics represents a generalisation of classical reaction-diffusion dynamics to the quantum realm. We first show how initial conditions can be introduced in the Keldysh path integral via boundary terms. We then study binary annihilation reactions $A+A\to\emptyset$, for which we derive a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The ensuing algebraic decay in time for the particle density depends on the particle statistics. In order to model possible experimental implementations with cold atoms, for fermions in $d=1$ we further discuss inhomogeneous cases involving the presence of a trapping potential. In this context, we quantify the irreversibility of the dynamics studying the time evolution of the system entropy for different quenches of the trapping potential. We find that the system entropy features algebraic decay for confining quenches, while it saturates in deconfined scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the probability typical distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and non-local frustration in the 1D ANNNI chain I -- The even case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effects of the competition between different sources of frustration in 1D spin chains through the analysis of the paradigmatic ANNNI model, which possesses an extensive amount of frustration of local origin due to the competition between nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions. An additional, non-extensive amount of topological frustration can be added by applying suitable boundary conditions, and we show that this seemingly subdominant contribution significantly affects the model. Choosing periodic boundary conditions with an {\it even} number of sites not divisible by 4 and using the entanglement entropy as a probe, we demonstrate that in one of the model's phases, the ground state can be characterized as hosting two (almost) independent excitations. Thus, not only do we show an intriguing interplay between different types of frustration, but also manage to propose a non-trivial quasi-particle interpretation for it.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transition and non-local complexity in generalized $W$ State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries of thermal processes in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is the asymmetry of thermal processes. Relaxation to thermal equilibrium is the most important dissipative process, being a key concept for the design of heat engines and refrigerators, contributing to the study of foundational questions of thermodynamics, and being relevant for quantum computing through the process of algorithmic cooling. Despite the importance of this kind of processes, their dynamics are far from being understood. We show that the free relaxation to thermal equilibrium follows intrinsically different paths depending on whether the temperature of the system increases (heating up) or decreases (cooling down), being faster in the first case. Our theory is exemplified using the recently developed thermal kinematics based on information geometry theory, utilizing three prototypical examples: a quantum two-level system, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and a trapped quantum Brownian particle, including both analytic results and numerical simulations. For this, we have extended the thermal kinematic approach to open quantum systems. Additionally, we offer a simple theoretical explanation in the case of a two level system and a more general picture for the other two systems based on the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian and the spectral gap of reciprocal processes.</description>

      <title>Complexity Scaling of Liquid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to excess-entropy scaling, dynamic properties of liquids like viscosity and diffusion coefficient are determined by the entropy. This link between dynamics and thermodynamics is increasingly studied and of interest also for industrial applications, but hampered by the challenge of calculating entropy efficiently. Utilizing the fact that entropy is basically the Kolmogorov complexity, which can be estimated from optimal compression algorithms [Avinery et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 178102 (2019); Martiniani et al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 011031 (2019)], we here demonstrate that the diffusion coefficients of four simple liquids follow a universal, exponential function of the estimated optimal-compression length of a single equilibrium configuration. We conclude that ``complexity scaling'' has the potential to become a useful tool for estimating dynamic properties of any liquid from a single configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we have studied collectives of active disks with an energy depot, moving in the two-dimensional plane and interacting via excluded volume. The energy depot accounts for the extraction of energy taking place at the level of each particle in order to perform self-propulsion, included in an underdampled Langevin dynamics. We show that this model undergoes a flocking transition, exhibiting some of the key features of the Vicsek model, namely, band formation and giant number fluctuations. Large density bands disappear as the activity is further increased, eventually reaching a homogeneous polar state. We unravel an effective alignment interaction at the level of two-particle collisions that can be controlled by activity and gives rise to flocking at large scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate thermodynamic and structural quantities of a fluid of hard spheres of diameter $\sigma$ in a quasi-one-dimensional pore with accessible pore width $W $ smaller than $\sigma$ by applying a perturbative method worked out earlier for a confined fluid in a slit pore [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{109}, 240601 (2012)]. In a first step, we prove that the thermodynamic and a certain class of structural quantities of the hard-sphere fluid in the pore can be obtained from a purely one-dimensional fluid of rods of length $ \sigma$ with a central hard core of size $\sigma_W =\sqrt{\sigma^2 - W^2}$ and a soft part at both ends of length $(\sigma-\sigma_W)/2$. These rods interact via effective $k$-body potentials $v^{(k)}_\text{eff}$ ($k \geq 2$) . The two- and the three-body potential will be calculated explicitly. In a second step, the free energy of this effective one-dimensional fluid is calculated up to leading order in $ (W/\sigma)^2$. Explicit results for, e.g. the perpendicular pressure, surface tension, and the density profile as a function of density, temperature, and pore width are presented presented and partly compared with results from Monte-Carlo simulations and standard virial expansions. Despite the perturbative character of our approach it encompasses the singularity of the thermodynamic quantities at the jamming transition point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nature of quantum phase transitions out of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ ordered phases in quantum loop models on a zig-zag ladder. We report very rich critical behaviour that includes a pair of Ising transitions, a multi-critical Ashkin-Teller point and a remarkably extended interval of a chiral transition. Although plaquette states turn out to be essential to realize chiral transitions, we demonstrate that critical regimes can be manipulated by deforming the model as to increase the presence of leg-dimerized states. This can be done to the point where the chiral transition turns into first order, we argue that this is associated with the emergence of a critical end point.</description>

      <title>Tracer dynamics in the active random average process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of tracer particles in the random average process (RAP), a single-file system in one dimension. In addition to the position, every particle possesses an internal spin variable $\sigma (t)$ that can alternate between two values, $\pm 1$, at a constant rate $\gamma$. Physically, the value of $\sigma (t)$ dictates the direction of motion of the corresponding particle and for finite $\gamma$, every particle performs a non-Markovian active dynamics. Herein, we study the effect of this non-Markovianity in the fluctuations and correlations of the positions of tracer particles. We analytically show that the variance of the position of a tagged particle grows sub-diffusively as $\sim \zeta_{\text{q}} \sqrt{t}$ at large times for the quenched uniform initial condition. While this sub-diffusive growth is identical to that of the Markovian/non-persistent RAP, the coefficient $\zeta_{\text{q}} $ is rather different and bears the signature of the persistent motion of active particles through higher point correlations (unlike in the Markovian case). Similarly, for the annealed (steady state) initial condition, we find that the variance scales as $\sim \zeta_{\text{a}} \sqrt{t}$ at large times with coefficient $\zeta_{\text{a}} $ once again different from the non-persistent case. Although $\zeta_{\text{q}}$ and $\zeta_{\text{a}} $ both individually depart from their Markov counterparts, their ratio $\zeta_{\text{a}} / \zeta_{\text{q}}$ is still equal to $\sqrt{2}$, a condition observed for other diffusive single-file systems. This condition turns out to be true even in the strongly active regimes as corroborated by extensive simulations and calculations. Finally, we study the correlation between the positions of two tagged particles in both quenched uniform and annealed initial conditions. We verify all our analytic results by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

We tackle this question by considering an occupation model in the spirit of the Sakoda-Schelling model, historically introduced to shed light on segregation dynamics among human groups. For a large class of utility functions and decision rules, we pinpoint the nonequilibrium nature of the agent dynamics, while recovering the equilibrium-like phase separation phenomenology. Within the mean field approximation we show how the model can be mapped, to some extent, onto an active matter field description. Finally, we consider non-reciprocal interactions between two populations, and show how they can lead to non-steady macroscopic behavior. We believe our approach provides a unifying framework to further study geography-dependent agent-based models, notably paving the way for joint consideration of population and price dynamics within a field theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Crossover in densities of confined particles with finite range of interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional classical system of $N$ particles confined within a harmonic trap. Interactions among these particles are dictated by a pairwise potential $V(x)$, where $x$ is the separation between two particles. Each particle can interact with a maximum of $d$ neighboring particles on either side (left or right), if available. By adjusting the parameter $d$, the system can be made nearest neighbour $(d=1)$ to all-to-all $(d=N-1)$ interacting. As suggested by prior studies, the equilibrium density profile of these particles is expected to undergo shape variations as $d$ is changed. In this paper, we investigate this crossover by tuning the parameter $f(=d/N)$ from $1$ to $0$ in the large $N$ limit for two distinct choices of interaction potentials, $V(x) = - |x|$ and $V(x) =- \log(|x|)$ which correspond to 1d one-component plasma and the log-gas model, respectively. For both models, the system size scaling of the density profile for fixed $f$ turns out to be the same as in their respective all-to-all cases. However, the scaling function exhibits diverse shapes as $f$ varies. We explicitly compute the average density profile for any $f \in (0,1]$ in the 1d plasma model, while for the log-gas model, we provide approximate calculations for large (close to $1$) and small (close to $0$) $f$. Additionally, we present simulation results to numerically demonstrate the crossover and compare these findings with our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Phase Diagram and Reaction Paths of the Active Model B with the Deep Minimum Action Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium phase transitions are notably difficult to analyze because their mechanisms depend on the system's dynamics in a complex way due to the lack of time-reversal symmetry. To complicate matters, the system's steady-state distribution is unknown in general. Here, the phase diagram of the active Model B is computed with a deep neural network implementation of the geometric minimum action method (gMAM). This approach unveils the unconventional reaction paths and nucleation mechanism in dimensions 1, 2 and 3, by which the system switches between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases in the binodal region. Our main findings are: (i) the mean time to escape the phase-separated state is (exponentially) extensive in the system size $L$, but it increases non-monotonically with $L$ in dimension 1; (ii) the mean time to escape the homogeneous state is always finite, in line with the recent work of Cates and Nardini~[Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 098203]; (iii) at fixed $L$, the active term increases the stability of the homogeneous phase, eventually destroying the phase separation in the binodal for large but finite systems. Our results are particularly relevant for active matter systems in which the number of constituents hardly goes beyond $10^7$ and where finite-size effects matter.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of an external trap, whereby a system relaxes to the minimum of the trap and is reset in a finite time. In this work, we set up and analyse the thermodynamics of such a protocol. We present a general framework, even valid for non-Poissonian resetting, that captures the thermodynamic work required to maintain a resetting process up to a given observation time, and exactly calculate the moment generating function of this work. Our framework is valid for a wide range of systems, the only assumption being relaxation to equilibrium in the resetting trap. Examples and extensions are considered. In the case of Brownian motion, we investigate optimal resetting schemes that minimise work and its fluctuations, the mean work for arbitrary switching protocols and comparisons to previously studied resetting schemes. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are prototypical correlated systems with local constraints, which are not only intimately connected to lattice gauge theories and topological orders but are also widely applicable to the broad research areas of quantum materials and quantum simulation. Employing our sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, we reveal the complete phase diagram of the triangular-lattice fully packed quantum loop model. Apart from the known lattice nematic (LN) solid and the even $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases, we discover a hidden vison plaquette (VP) phase, which had been overlooked and misinterpreted as a QSL for more than a decade. Moreover, the VP-to-QSL continuous transition belongs to the $(2+1)$D cubic* universality class, which offers a lattice realization of the (fractionalized) cubic fixed point that had long been considered as irrelevant towards the O($3$) symmetry until corrected recently by conformal bootstrap calculations. Our results are therefore of relevance to recent developments in both experiments and theory, and facilitate further investigations of hidden phases and transitions.</description>

      <title>Many-body entropies and entanglement from polynomially-many local measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating global properties of many-body quantum systems such as entropy or bipartite entanglement is a notoriously difficult task, typically requiring a number of measurements or classical post-processing resources growing exponentially in the system size. In this work, we address the problem of estimating global entropies and mixed-state entanglement via partial-transposed (PT) moments, and show that efficient estimation strategies exist under the assumption that all the spatial correlation lengths are finite. Focusing on one-dimensional systems, we identify a set of approximate factorization conditions (AFCs) on the system density matrix which allow us to reconstruct entropies and PT moments from information on local subsystems. This yields a simple and efficient strategy for entropy and entanglement estimation. Our method could be implemented in different ways, depending on how information on local subsystems is extracted. Focusing on randomized measurements (RMs), providing a practical and common measurement scheme, we prove that our protocol only requires polynomially-many measurements and post-processing operations, assuming that the state to be measured satisfies the AFCs. We prove that the AFCs hold for finite-depth quantum-circuit states and translation-invariant matrix-product density operators, and provide numerical evidence that they are satisfied in more general, physically-interesting cases, including thermal states of local Hamiltonians. We argue that our method could be practically useful to detect bipartite mixed-state entanglement for large numbers of qubits available in today's quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Universal Hyperuniform Organization in Looped Leaf Vein Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leaf vein network is a hierarchical vascular system that transports water and nutrients to the leaf cells. The thick primary veins form a branched network, while the secondary veins develop closed circuits forming a well-defined cellular structure. Through extensive analysis of a variety of distinct leaf species, we discover that the apparently disordered cellular structures of the secondary vein networks exhibit a universal hyperuniform organization and possess a hidden order on large scales. Disorder hyperuniform (DHU) systems lack conventional long-range order, yet they completely suppress normalized large-scale density fluctuations like crystals. Specifically, we find that the distributions of the geometric centers associated with the vein network loops possess a vanishing static structure factor in the zero-wavenumber limit, i.e., $S(k) \sim k^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha \approx 0.64$, providing an example of class III hyperuniformity in biology. This hyperuniform organization leads to superior efficiency of diffusive transport, as evidenced by the much faster convergence of the time-dependent spreadability $\mathcal{S}(t)$ to its long-time asymptotic limit, compared to that of other uncorrelated or correlated disordered but non-hyperuniform organizations. Our results also have implications for the discovery and design of novel disordered network materials with optimal transport properties.</description>

      <title>Realizing Altermagnetism in Fermi-Hubbard Models with Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a new type of collinear magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.</description>

      <title>Markovian to non-Markovian phase transition in the operator dynamics of a mobile impurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random unitary circuit model of an impurity moving through a chaotic medium. The exchange of information between the medium and impurity is controlled by varying the velocity of the impurity, $v_d$, relative to the speed of information propagation within the medium, $v_B$. Above supersonic velocities, $v_d&gt; v_B$, information cannot flow back to the impurity after it has moved into the medium, and the resulting dynamics are Markovian. Below supersonic velocities, $v_d&lt; v_B$, the dynamics of the impurity and medium are non-Markovian, and information is able to flow back onto the impurity. We show the two regimes are separated by a continuous phase transition with exponents directly related to the diffusive spreading of operators in the medium. This is demonstrated by monitoring an out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) in a scenario where the impurity is substituted at an intermediate time. During the Markovian phase, information from the medium cannot transfer onto the replaced impurity, manifesting in no significant operator development. Conversely, in the non-Markovian phase, we observe that operators acquire support on the newly introduced impurity. We also characterize the dynamics using the coherent information and provide two decoders which can efficiently probe the transition between Markovian and non-Markovian information flow. Our work demonstrates that Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics can be separated by a phase transition, and we propose an efficient protocol for observing this transition.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, truly collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>The evolution of pluralistic ignorance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pluralistic ignorance is a social-psychological phenomenon that occurs when individuals privately hold beliefs that differ from perceived group norms. Traditional models, based on opinion dynamics with private and public states, fail to account for a key aspect: when nonexpression aligns with normative behavior, initial social pressure can induce pluralistic ignorance. We show that pluralistic ignorance persists under infrequent imitation and strong initial minority influence. Although individuals can overcome this ignorance by the end of interactions, it reemerges in subsequent meetings. However, excessive imitation erases pluralistic ignorance, leading to a uniform state in which internal and external states align. Furthermore, incorporating memory into the internalization process shows that pluralistic ignorance peaks at moderate imitation levels.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Correlation Augmented Self-Consistent Field Theory and Its Application to Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>
