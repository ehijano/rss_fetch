      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos with gravitational wave and $\gamma$-ray burst joint observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to detect them. Future gravitational wave (GW) observations can precisely measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies generated by traditional cosmological observations. This advancement can lead to much tighter constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. This work provides a preliminary forecast for detecting sterile neutrinos using third-generation GW detectors in combination with future short $\gamma$-ray burst observations from a THESEUS-like telescope, an approach not previously explored in the literature. Both massless and massive sterile neutrinos are considered within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that using GW data can greatly enhance the detection capability for massless sterile neutrinos, reaching 3$\sigma$ level. For massive sterile neutrinos, GW data can also greatly assist in improving the parameter constraints, but it seems that effective detection is still not feasible.</description>

      <title>Spectral Dataset of Young Type Ib Supernovae and their Time-evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to high-cadence automated surveys, we can now detect and classify supernovae (SNe) within a few days after explosion, if not earlier. Early-time spectra of young SNe directly probe the outermost layers of the ejecta, providing insights into the extent of stripping in the progenitor star and the explosion mechanism in the case of core-collapse supernovae. However, many SNe show overlapping observational characteristics at early time, complicating the early-time classification. In this paper, we focus on the study and classification of Type Ib supernovae (SNe Ib), which are a subclass of core-collapse supernovae that lack strong hydrogen lines but show helium lines in their spectra. Here we present a spectral dataset of 8 SNe Ib, chosen to have at least 3 pre-maximum spectra, which we call early spectra. Our dataset was obtained mainly by the the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and consists of a total of 82 optical photospheric spectra, including 38 early spectra. This data set increases the number of published SNe Ib with at least three early spectra by ~60%. For our classification efforts, we use early spectra in addition to spectra taken around maximum light. We also convert our spectra into SN Identification (SNID) templates and make them available to the community for easier identification of young SNe Ib. Our data set increases the number of publicly available SNID templates of early spectra of SNe Ib by ~43%. Almost half of our sample has SN types that change over time or are different from what is listed on the Transient Name Server (TNS). We discuss the implications of our dataset and our findings for current and upcoming SN surveys and their classification efforts.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nuclear equation of state from orbits of primordial black holes inside neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lacking terrestrial experimental data, our best constraints on the behavior of matter at high densities up to and above nuclear density arise from observations of neutron stars. Current constraints include those based on measurements of stellar masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities. Here we explore how orbits of primordial black holes - should they exist - inside neutron stars could provide complementary constraints on the nuclear equation of state (EOS). Specifically, we consider a sample of candidate EOSs, construct neutron star models for these EOSs, and compute orbits of primordial black holes inside these stars. We discuss how the pericenter advance of eccentric orbits, i.e. orbital precession, results in beat phenomena in the emitted gravitational wave signal. Observing this beat frequency could constrain the nuclear EOS and break possible degeneracies arising from other constraints, as well as provide information about the host star.</description>

      <title>GRB 221009A: the B.O.A.T Burst that Shines in Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete analysis of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data of GRB 221009A, the brightest Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) ever detected. The burst emission above 30 MeV detected by the LAT preceded by 1 s the low-energy (&lt; 10 MeV) pulse that triggered the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM), as has been observed in other GRBs. The prompt phase of GRB 221009A lasted a few hundred seconds. It was so bright that we identify a Bad Time Interval (BTI) of 64 seconds caused by the extremely high flux of hard X-rays and soft gamma rays, during which the event reconstruction efficiency was poor and the dead time fraction quite high. The late-time emission decayed as a power law, but the extrapolation of the late-time emission during the first 450 seconds suggests that the afterglow started during the prompt emission. We also found that high-energy events observed by the LAT are incompatible with synchrotron origin, and, during the prompt emission, are more likely related to an extra component identified as synchrotron self-Compton (SSC). A remarkable 400 GeV photon, detected by the LAT 33 ks after the GBM trigger and directionally consistent with the location of GRB 221009A, is hard to explain as a product of SSC or TeV electromagnetic cascades, and the process responsible for its origin is uncertain. Because of its proximity and energetic nature, GRB 221009A is an extremely rare event.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing flares from black hole binaries IV: the number of detectable shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-parsec supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries are expected to be common in active galactic nuclei (AGN), as a result of the hierarchical build-up of galaxies via mergers. While direct evidence for these compact binaries is lacking, a few hundred candidates have been identified, most based on the apparent periodicities of their optical light-curves. Since these signatures can be mimicked by AGN red-noise, additional evidence is needed to confirm their binary nature. Recurring self-lensing flares (SLF), occurring whenever the two BHs are aligned with the line of sight within their Einstein radii, have been suggested as additional binary signatures. Furthermore, in many cases, lensing flares are also predicted to contain a "dip", whenever the lensed SMBH's shadow is comparable in angular size to the binary's Einstein radius. This feature would unambiguously confirm binaries and additionally identify SMBH shadows that are spatially unresolvable by high-resolution VLBI. Here we estimate the number of quasars for which these dips may be detectable by LSST, by extrapolating the quasar luminosity function to faint magnitudes, and assuming that SMBH binaries are randomly oriented and have mass-ratios following those in the Illustris simulations. Under plausible assumptions about quasar lifetimes, binary fractions, and Eddington ratios, we expect tens of thousands of detectable flares, of which several dozen contain measurable dips.</description>

      <title>The Dispersion Relation of Massive Photons in Plasma: A Comment on "Bounding the Photon Mass with Ultrawide Bandwidth Pulsar Timing Data and Dedispersed Pulses of Fast Radio Bursts"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion measures of fast radio bursts have been identified as a powerful tool for testing the zero-mass hypothesis of the photon. The classical approach treats the massive photon-induced and plasma-induced time delays as two separate phenomena. Recently, Wang et al. (2024) suggested that the joint influence of the nonzero photon mass and plasma effects should be considered, and proposed a revised time delay for massive photons propagating in a plasma medium, denoted as $\Delta t'_{m_{\gamma}} \propto \nu^{-4}$, which departures from the classical dispersion relation ($\propto \nu^{-2}$). Here we discuss the derivation presented by Wang et al. (2024) and show that the classical dispersion relation remains valid based on Proca equations.</description>

      <title>Formation of twin compact stars in low-mass X-ray binaries: Implications on eccentric and isolated millisecond pulsar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are laboratories for stellar evolution, strong gravity, and ultra-dense matter. Although MSPs are thought to originate in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), approximately 27% lack a binary companion, while others are found in systems with large orbital eccentricities. Understanding how these systems form may provide insight into the internal properties of neutron stars (NSs).
  We study the formation of a twin compact star through rapid first-order phase transitions in NS cores due to mass accretion in LMXBs. We investigate whether this mechanism, possibly coupled with secondary kick effects such as neutrino or electromagnetic rocket effects, may leave an observable long-lasting imprint on the orbit.
  We simulate mass accretion in LMXBs consisting of a NS and a low-mass main sequence companion, following the evolution of the NS mass, radius, and spin until a strong phase transition is triggered. For the NS structure, we assume a multipolytrope equation-of-state that allows for a sharp phase transition from hadronic to quark matter and satisfies observational constraints.
  We find that in compact binaries with relatively short pre-Roche lobe overflow orbital periods, an accretion-induced phase transition may occur during the LMXB phase. In contrast, in systems with wider orbits, this transition may take place during the spin-down phase, forming an eccentric binary MSP. If the transition is accompanied by a secondary kick (w &gt; 20 km/s), the binary is likely to be disrupted, forming an isolated MSP or reconfigured to an ultra-wide orbit.
  Our results suggest that accretion in LMXBs provides a viable path for forming twin compact stars, potentially leaving an observable imprint on the orbit. The eccentricity distribution of binary MSPs with long (&gt; 50 d) orbital periods could provide constraints on first-order phase transitions in dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Multi-epoch UV $-$ X-ray spectral study of NGC 4151 with AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength spectral study of NGC 4151 based on five epochs of simultaneous AstroSat observations in the near ultra-violet (NUV) to hard X-ray band ($\sim 0.005-80$ keV) during $2017 - 2018$. We derived the intrinsic accretion disk continuum after correcting for internal and Galactic extinction, contributions from broad and narrow line regions, and emission from the host galaxy. We found a bluer continuum at brighter UV flux possibly due to variations in the accretion disk continuum or the UV reddening. We estimated the intrinsic reddening, $E(B-V) \sim 0.4$, using high-resolution HST/STIS spectrum acquired in March 2000. We used thermal Comptonization, neutral and ionized absorption, and X-ray reflection to model the X-ray spectra. We obtained the X-ray absorbing neutral column varying between $N_H \sim 1.2-3.4 \times 10^{23} cm^{-2}$, which are $\sim 100$ times larger than that estimated from UV extinction, assuming the Galactic dust-to-gas ratio. To reconcile this discrepancy, we propose two plausible configurations of the obscurer: (a) a two-zone obscurer consisting of dust-free and dusty regions, divided by the sublimation radius, or (b) a two-phase obscurer consisting of clumpy, dense clouds embedded in a low-density medium, resulting in a scenario where a few dense clouds obscure the compact X-ray source substantially, while the bulk of UV emission arising from the extended accretion disk passes through the low-density medium. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between X-ray absorption column and $NUV-FUV$ color and UV flux, indicative of enhanced winds possibly driven by the 'bluer-when-brighter' UV continuum.</description>

      <title>A precessing stellar disk model for superorbital modulations of the gamma-ray binary LS I+61$^{\circ}$ 303</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray binary LS I+61$^{\circ}$ 303 consists of a neutron star orbiting around a Be star with a period of $P_{\rm orb}\simeq26.5\ {\rm d}$. Apart from orbital modulations, the binary shows long-term flux variations with a superorbital period of $P_{\rm sup}\simeq4.6\ {\rm yrs}$ as seen in nearly all wavelengths. The origin of this superorbital modulation is still not well understood. Under the pulsar wind-stellar outflow interaction scenario, we propose that the superorbital modulations of LS I+61$^{\circ}$ 303 could be caused by the precession of the Be disk. Assuming X-rays arise from synchrotron radiation of the intrabinary shock, we develop an analytical model to calculate expected flux modulations over the orbital and superorbital phases. The asymmetric two-peak profiles in orbital light curves and sinusoidal-like long-term modulations are reproduced under the precessing disk scenario. The observed orbital phase drifting of the X-ray peak and our fitting of long-term X-ray data indicate that the neutron star is likely orbiting around the star with a small eccentricity and periastron phase around $\Phi_{\rm p}\sim0.6$. We compare the Corbet diagrams of LS I+61$^{\circ}$ 303 with other Be/X-ray binaries and the linear correlation in the $P_{\rm sup}-P_{\rm orb}$ diagram suggests that the precession of the Be disk in LS I+61$^{\circ}$ 303 is induced by the tidal torque of its neutron star companion.</description>

      <title>An Intermediate Luminosity GRB 210210A: The early onset of the external forward shock in the X-ray?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed the prompt and afterglow characteristics of the intermediate luminosity burst ``GRB 210210A". Our prompt emission analysis indicates that GRB 210210A is among the softest long GRBs detected by the Swift-BAT. The time-integrated prompt emission spectrum of GRB 210210A is aptly described by a power law function with an exponential cutoff. The spectral peak energy (E$_{p,z}$) in rest-frame and the E$_{\rm \gamma, iso}$ for this GRB marginally satisfy the 2$\sigma$ Amati correlation, a common feature observed in low/intermediate luminosity GRBs. Notably, an early bump is observed in the Swift-XRT light curve (a rare feature); the optical afterglow light curve, on the other hand, appears to follow a power law decay. However, due to the lack of sufficient early optical observations, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of an early bump in the optical light curve. For the bump observed in the early X-ray light curve, we calculated parameters such as peak time, rise time, decay time, and bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{0}$ $\sim$ 156), which perfectly satisfy the correlation between the parameters of the onset of the afterglow in GRBs. Both the optical and X-ray (including our observations) light curves exhibit a chromatic break in the late afterglow. Based on the prompt and afterglow parameters, we confirm that the intermediate luminosity GRB 210210A favors a collapsar scenario and is possibly powered by a magnetar.</description>

      <title>Low-mass neutron star nucleosynthesis -- stripping scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines nucleosynthesis in a low-mass neutron star crust that loses mass due to accretion in a close binary system and, reaching a hydrodynamically unstable configuration explodes. The r-process proceeds mainly in the inner crust. Nucleosynthesis in the outer crust is an explosive process with a sharp increase in temperature caused by an outward-propagating shockwave (shock-wave nucleosynthesis). The number of heavy elements produced in a low-mass neutron star crust during the explosion is approximately equals 0.041 solar masses, which exceeds the number of heavy elements ejected as jets in the neutron star merger scenario.</description>

      <title>The influence of the magnetic braking laws on the evolution of persistent and transient low-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swift J1858.6$-$0814 (hereafter J1858) is a transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS LMXB). There is controversy regarding its donor mass derived from observations and theoretical calculations. In this paper, we adopt seven magnetic braking (MB) prescriptions suggested in the literature and different metallicity $Z$ to simulate the evolution of the LMXB. Our results show that, employing the MB model proposed by \citet{2012ApJ...746...43R} ("rm12"), the Convection And Rotation Boosted ("carb") model \citep{2019ApJ...886L..31V}, as well as the Intermediate ("inter") and Convection-boosted ("cboost") models in \citet{2019MNRAS.483.5595V} can match (part of) the observational parameters of J1858 well. We then apply our method to other observed LMXBs and find that the "rm12" and "inter" MB laws are most promising in explaining transient LMXBs. In comparison, the simulations with the "cboost" and "carb" MB laws are more inclined to reproduce persistent LMXBs and ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), respectively. Our results, though subject to computational and/or observational bias, show that it is challenging to find a unified MB law that applies to the NS LMXB sub-populations simultaneously, indicating our lack of understanding of the true MB law. In addition, we explore the influence of various MB laws on the magnitude of the bifurcation periods in LMXBs.</description>

      <title>3D hybrid fluid-particle jet simulations and the importance of synchrotron radiative losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05256v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei are known for their exceptional energy output, and imaging the synthetic synchrotron emission of numerical jet simulations is essential for a comparison with observed jet polarization emission. Aims. Through the use of 3D hybrid fluid-particle jet simulations (with the PLUTO code), we overcome some of the commonly made assumptions in relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations by using non-thermal particle attributes to account for the resulting synchrotron radiation. Polarized radiative transfer and ray-tracing (via the RADMC-3D code) highlight the differences in total intensity maps when (i) the jet is simulated purely with the RMHD approach, (ii) a jet tracer is considered in the RMHD approach, and (iii) a hybrid fluid-particle approach is used. The resulting emission maps were compared to the example of the radio galaxy Centaurus A. Methods. We applied the Lagrangian particle module implemented in the latest version of the PLUTO code. This new module contains a state-of-the-art algorithm for modeling diffusive shock acceleration and for accounting for radiative losses in RMHD jet simulations. The module implements the physical postulates missing in RMHD jet simulations by accounting for a cooled ambient medium and strengthening the central jet emission. Results. We find a distinction between the innermost structure of the jet and the back-flowing material by mimicking the radio emission of the Seyfert II radio galaxy Centaurus A when considering an edge-brightened jet with an underlying purely toroidal magnetic field. We demonstrate the necessity of synchrotron cooling as well as the improvements gained when directly accounting for non-thermal synchrotron radiation via non-thermal particles.</description>

      <title>Confronting new NICER mass-radius measurements with phase transition in dense matter and compact twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (re)analysis of data on the X-ray emitting pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as new results on PSR J0437-4715, are confronted with the predictions of the equation of state (EoS) models allowing for strong first-order phase transition for the mass-radius ($M$-$R$) diagram. We use models that are based on a covariant density functional (CDF) EoS for nucleonic matter at low densities and a quark matter EoS, parameterized by the speed of sound, at higher densities. To account for the variations in the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 obtained from different analyses, we examined three scenarios to assess their consistency with our models, focusing particularly on the potential formation of twin stars. We found that in two scenarios, where the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437-4715 with masses close to the canonical mass $\sim 1.4\,M_{\odot}$ are significantly separated, our models allow for the presence of twin stars as a natural explanation for potential differences in the radii of these stars.</description>

      <title>Fast magnetic reconnection in Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic scenario of fast magnetic reconnection process, for general magnetohydrodynamical plasmas around Kerr black holes. Generalizing the Petschek model, we study various properties of the reconnection layer in distinct configurations. When current sheet forms in the zero-angular-momentum (ZAMO) frame which corotates with the black hole, the reconnection rate for both radial and azimuthal configurations is decreased by spacetime curvature. However, when the current sheet forms in a non-ZAMO frame, which rotates either faster or slower than the black hole, detail analysis establishes that for any given slow rotations (subrelativistic at most) and mildly relativistic inflow, the ZAMO observer will find asymmetric reconnection rates for radial configuration: it is decreased on one side of the current sheet and is increased on the other side in comparison to the unrotation limit. This is valid to both the Sweet-Parker and the Petschek scenario. The results clarify the effects of rotation on the reconnection layer in the laboratory frame in the flat spacetime limit.</description>

      <title>Rapid, strongly magnetized accretion in the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exist two qualitatively different turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second (the "low-$\beta$ state"), which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress $\alpha \sim 1$. The low-$\beta$ state is realized in simulations that begin with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this is true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta\ll1$, provided the thermal scale-height of the disk is well-resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we find may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work including the implications of our results for global accretion disk simulations.</description>

      <title>Origin of the break in the cosmic-ray electron plus positron spectrum at ~ 1 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the cosmic-ray electron plus positron spectrum by several experiments have confirmed the presence of a break at $\sim\,1$ TeV. The origin of the break is still not clearly understood. In this work, we explore different possibilities for the origin which include an electron source spectrum with a broken power-law, a power-law with an exponential or super-exponential cut-offs and the absence of potential nearby cosmic-ray sources. Based on the observed electron plus positron data from the DAMPE and the H.E.S.S experiments, and considering supernova remnants as the main sources of cosmic rays in the Galaxy, we find statistical evidence in favour of the scenario with a broken power-law source spectrum with the best-fit source parameters obtained as $\Gamma=2.39$ for the source spectral index, $E_0\approx 1.6$ TeV for the break energy and $f=1.59\times 10^{48}$ ergs for the amount of supernova kinetic energy injected into cosmic-ray electrons. Such a power-law break in the spectrum has been predicted for electrons confined inside supernova remnants after acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration process, and also indicated by the multi-wavelength study of supernova remnants. All these evidences have shown that the observed spectral break provides a strong indication of a direct link between cosmic-ray electrons and their sources. Our findings further show that electrons must undergo spectral changes while escaping the source region in order to reconcile the difference between the spectral index of electrons observed inside supernova remnants and that obtained from Galactic cosmic-ray propagation studies.</description>

      <title>Searching for redshifted 2.2 MeV neutron-capture lines from accreting neutron stars: Theoretical X-ray luminosity requirements and INTEGRAL/SPI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting neutron stars (NSs) are expected to emit a redshifted 2.2 MeV line due to the capture of neutrons produced through the spallation processes of $^4$He and heavier ions in their atmospheres. Detecting this emission would offer an independent method for constraining the equation of state of NSs and provide valuable insights into nuclear reactions occurring in extreme gravitational and magnetic environments. Typically, a higher mass accretion rate is expected to result in a higher 2.2 MeV line intensity. However, when the mass accretion rate approaches the critical threshold, the accretion flow is decelerated by the radiative force, leading to a less efficient production of free neutrons and a corresponding drop in the flux of the spectral line. This makes the brightest X-ray pulsars unsuitable candidates for gamma-ray line detection. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for predicting the optimal X-ray luminosity required to detect a redshifted 2.2 MeV line in a strongly magnetized NS. As the INTEGRAL mission nears its conclusion, we have undertaken a thorough investigation of the SPI data of this line in a representative sample of accreting NSs. No redshifted 2.2 MeV line was detected. For each spectrum, we have determined the 3-sigma upper limits of the line intensity, assuming different values of the line width. Our findings suggest that advancing our understanding of the emission mechanism of the 2.2 MeV line, as well as the accretion flow responsible for it, will require a substantial increase in sensitivity from future MeV missions. For example, for a bright X-ray binary such as Sco X-1, we would need at least a 3-sigma line point source sensitivity of ~1E-6 ph/cm^2/s, that is, about two orders of magnitude better than that currently achieved.

      <title>Unveiling the short and faint X-ray transient nature of IGR J17419-2802</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new X-ray results from the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), Swift, Chandra, and XMM-Newton observations of the hitherto poorly studied unidentified X-ray transient IGR J17419-2802. We studied in detail the temporal, spectral, and energetic properties of three hard X-ray outbursts detected above 20 keV by INTEGRAL. They are all characterized by an average X-ray luminosity of 3$\times$10$^{35}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ and a constrained duration of a few days. This marks a peculiarly short and faint X-ray transient nature for IGR J17419-2802. From archival unpublished soft X-ray observations, we found that the source spends most of the time undetected at very low X-ray fluxes (down to $&lt;4.7\times10^{-14}$ erg cm $^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) for a dynamic range &gt;2,000 when in outburst. We provided an accurate arcsecond-sized source error circle. Inside it, we pinpointed the best candidate near-infrared counterpart whose photometric properties are compatible with a late-type spectral nature. Based on our new findings, we suggest that IGR J17419-2802 is a new member of the very faint X-ray transients (VFXTs) class. Detailed investigations of VFXT outbursts above 20 keV are particularly rare. In this respect, our reported INTEGRAL outbursts are among the best studied to date; in particular, their constrained duration of a few days is among the shortest ever measured for a VFXT.</description>

      <title>Nature vs Nurture: Three Dimensional MHD Simulations of Misaligned Embedded Circum-Single Disks within an AGN Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar mass black holes in the disks around active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational wave detections by LIGO/VIRGO. Recent studies suggest this environment fosters the formation and merger of binary black holes. Many of these studies often assumed a simple, laminar AGN disk without magnetic fields or turbulence. In this work, we present the first 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of circum-single disks around isolated and binary black holes in strongly magnetized, stratified accretion disks with turbulence driven by magneto-rotational instability. We simulated three scenarios with varying initial net-vertical magnetic field strengths: weak, intermediate, and strong. Our results show that weakly magnetized models produce circum-single disks aligned with the AGN disk's equatorial plane, similar to past hydrodynamic simulations. However, intermediate and strong magnetic fields result in randomly misaligned disks, contingent upon the availability of local ambient angular momentum within turbulent regions. Our findings emphasize the significant impact of ambient gas in the AGN disk on the inclination of circum-single disks, linked to magnetically induced inhomogeneity and angular momentum during disk formation. The presence of misaligned disks, both in single and binary black hole systems, could have profound implications for the long-term evolution of black hole spin and the inclination of the disk at the horizon scale.</description>

      <title>The relation between Simulated Multiwavelength Blazar Variability and Stochastic Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars exhibit multiwavelength variability, a phenomenon whose underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study investigates the origin of such variability through leptonic blazar emission simulations, focusing on stochastic fluctuations in environmental parameters. By analyzing the spectral indices of the power spectral densities of the variability, we assess their relationship with the underlying fluctuations. Our findings reveal that the variability spectral indices remain almost independent of the variations responsible for their emergence. This suggests a complex interplay of factors contributing to the observed multiwavelength variability in blazars.</description>

      <title>Detection of the Fe K lines from the binary AGN in 4C+37.11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the Fe K line emission at $\sim6.62^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ keV with a width of $\sim0.19^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ keV using two epochs of {\it Chandra} archival data from the nucleus of the galaxy 4C+37.11, which is known to host a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH) system where the SMBHs are separated by $\sim7$ mas or $\sim$ 7pc. Our study reports the first detection of the Fe K line from a known binary AGN, and has an F-statistic value of 20.98 and probability $2.47\times 10^{-12}$. Stacking of two spectra reveals another Fe K line component at $\sim7.87^{+0.19}_{-0.09}$ keV. Different model scenarios indicate that the lines originate from the combined effects of accretion disk emission and circumnuclear collisionally ionized medium. The observed low column density favors the gas-poor merger scenario, where the high temperature of the hot ionized medium may be associated with the shocked gas in the binary merger and not with star formation activity. The estimated total BSMBH mass and disk inclination are $\sim1.5\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and $\gtrsim75^\circ$, indicating that the BSMBH is probably a high inclination system. The spin parameter could not be tightly constrained from the present data sets. Our results draw attention to the fact that detecting the Fe K line emissions from BSMBHs is important for estimating the individual SMBH masses, and the spins of the binary SMBHs, as well as exploring their emission regions.</description>

      <title>Examining the Relationship Between the Persistent Emission and the Accretion Rate During a Type I X-ray Burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion flow onto a neutron star will be impacted due to irradiation by a Type I X-ray burst. The burst radiation exerts Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag on the accretion disk, leading to an enhanced mass accretion rate. Observations of X-ray bursts often find evidence that the normalization of the disk-generated persistent emission (commonly denoted by the factor $f_a$) increases during a burst, and changes in $f_a$ have been used to infer the evolution in the mass accretion rate due to PR drag. Here, we examine this proposed relationship between $f_a$ and mass accretion rate enhancement using time-resolved data from simulations of accretion disks impacted by Type I X-ray bursts. We consider bursts from both spinning and non-spinning neutron stars and track both the change in accretion rate due to PR grad and the disk emission spectra during the burst. Regardless of the neutron star spin, we find that $f_a$ strongly correlates with the disk temperature and only weakly follows the mass accretion rate (the Pearson correlation coefficients are $\leq 0.63$ in the latter case). Additionally, heating causes the disk to emit at higher energies, reducing its contribution to a soft excess. We conclude that $f_a$ cannot accurately capture the mass accretion rate enhancement and is rather a tracer of the disk temperature.</description>

      <title>Exploring the intermittency of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence by synchrotron polarization radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a critical role in many key astrophysical processes such as star formation, acceleration of cosmic rays, and heat conduction. However, its properties are still poorly understood. We explore how to extract the intermittency of compressible MHD turbulence from the synthetic and real observations. The three statistical methods, namely the probability distribution function, kurtosis, and scaling exponent of the multi-order structure function, are used to reveal the intermittency of MHD turbulence. Our numerical results demonstrate that: (1) the synchrotron polarization intensity statistics can be used to probe the intermittency of magnetic turbulence, by which we can distinguish different turbulence regimes; (2) the intermittency of MHD turbulence is dominated by the slow mode in the sub-Alfv{\'e}nic turbulence regime; (3) the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) at the low latitude region corresponds to the sub-Alfv\'enic and supersonic turbulence regime. We have successfully measured the intermittency of the Galactic ISM from the synthetic and realistic observations.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of gravitational collapse in the accreting neutron stars of binary-driven hypernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state (EOS), with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH) and its occurrence time, $t_\textrm{col}$. We include a non-zero angular momentum of the NSs and find that $t_\textrm{col}$ ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about five minutes orbital period), promptly form a BH and release $\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg. They form NS-BH binaries with tens of kyr merger timescale by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, release $\sim 10^{50}$-$10^{52}$ erg and $\lesssim 10^{50}$ erg. They form NS-NS with a wider range of merger timescales. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a non-rotating NS. Magnetic braking by a $10^{13}$ G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH-BH or NS-BH of tens of kyr merger timescale.</description>

      <title>Study of acoustic neutrino detection in O$\nu$DE-2 raw acoustic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research suggests that acoustic technology may be able to detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos if a large amount of non-linear fluid is analyzed. When a neutrino interacts in water, it creates a quasi-instantaneous cascade of particles, heating that region of the fluid and emitting a tiny acoustic signal. This rapid heating produces a thermoacoustic Bipolar Pulse (BP) with unique characteristics such as a wide bandwidth and a narrow directivity for these frequencies. While dedicated devices for acoustic neutrino detection are currently non-existent, there are a few underwater neutrino telescopes that utilize optical technology, but often with an acoustic positioning system that deploys hydrophones in the infrastructure. The possibility of using them to study a BP caused by a neutrino interaction is currently being discussed. This study aims to evaluate the implementation of a trigger system to detect a possible BP in deep-sea hydrophones. For this, up to 24 hours of the raw acoustic signal recorded by the O$\nu$DE-2 station, which was located 25 km off-shore from Catania in the Western Ionian Sea, at 2100 m depth, is analyzed. The station used calibrated hydrophones from a few Hz to 70 kHz. In this work, a synthetic BP is created and added to the experimental data, allowing the study of its detection and the calculation of precision and recall.</description>

      <title>A Deeper Look into eFEDS AGN Candidates in Dwarf Galaxies with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to accurately discern active massive black holes (BHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies is paramount to understanding the origins and processes of "seed" BHs in the early Universe. We present Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of a sample of three local dwarf galaxies (M$_{*}$ $\leqslant 3 \times 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$, z $\leqslant$ 0.15) previously identified as candidates for hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). The galaxies were selected from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) with spatially coincident X-ray detections in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS). Our new Chandra data reveal three X-ray point sources in two of the target galaxies with luminosities between log(L$_{\rm \text{2-10 keV}}$ [erg s$^{-1}$]) = 39.1 and 40.4. Our results support the presence of an AGN in these two galaxies and a ULX in one of them. For the AGNs, we estimate BH masses of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5-6} M_\odot$ and Eddington ratios on the order of $\sim 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the most complete analysis so far of quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein's theory. By finding the corrections to the Teukolsky equation and expressing them in a simple form, we are able to apply a generalized continued fraction method that allows us to find the quasinormal mode frequencies including overtones. We obtain the leading-order corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies of all the $(l,m,n)$ modes with $l=2,3,4$, $-l\le m\le l$ and $n=0,1,2$, and express them as a function of the black hole spin $\chi$ using polynomial fits. We estimate that our results remain accurate up to spins between $\chi\sim 0.7$ and $\chi\sim 0.95$, depending on the mode. We report that overtones are overall more sensitive to corrections, which is expected from recent literature on this topic. We also discuss the limit of validity of the linear corrections to the quasinormal mode frequencies by estimating the size of nonlinear effects in the higher-derivative couplings. All our results are publicly available in an online repository.</description>

      <title>The next frontiers for magnetic monopole searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles (MMs) are well-motivated hypothetical particles whose discovery would symmetrize Maxwell equations, explain quantization of electric charge, and probe the gauge structure of the unified theory. Recent models predict MMs with low masses, reinvigorating searches at colliders. However, most theories predict composite MMs, whose production in parton-parton collisions is expected to be suppressed. The Schwinger process, whereby MM pairs tunnel through the vacuum barrier in the presence of a strong magnetic field, is not subject to this limitation. Additionally, the Schwinger cross section can be calculated nonperturbatively. Together, these make it a golden channel for low-mass MM searches. We investigate the Schwinger production of MMs in heavy-ion collisions at future colliders, in collisions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, and in decay of magnetic fields of cosmic origin. We find that a next-generation collider would provide the best sensitivity. At the same time, exploiting the infrastructure of industrial ore extraction and Antarctic ice drilling could advance the field at a faster timescale and with only a modest investment. We also propose deploying dedicated MM detectors in conjunction with cosmic ray observatories to directly investigate if the unexplained, highest energy cosmic rays are MMs. Together, the proposed efforts would define the field of MM searches in the next decades.</description>

      <title>Gravitational baryogenesis in energy-momentum squared gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of gravitational baryogenesis within the context of a specific modified theory of gravity, namely, energy-momentum squared gravity or $f(R, T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity. In this framework, the gravitational Lagrangian is formulated as a general function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the self-contraction of the energy-momentum tensor, $\mathcal{T}^2 \equiv T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$. This approach extends the conventional paradigm of gravitational baryogenesis by introducing new dependencies that allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the baryon asymmetry problem. Our analysis aims to elucidate the role of these gravitational modifications in the generation of baryon asymmetry, a critical issue in cosmology that remains unresolved within the Standard Model of particle physics. By incorporating $\mathcal{T}^2$ into the gravitational action, we propose that these modifications can significantly influence the dynamics of the early universe, thereby altering the conditions under which baryogenesis occurs. This study not only provides a novel depiction of gravitational baryogenesis but also offers insights into how modified gravity theories can address the longstanding question of baryon asymmetry. The implications of our findings suggest that $f(R, T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity could play a crucial role in understanding the fundamental processes that led to the matter-antimatter imbalance observed in the universe today.</description>

      <title>Leptodermic corrections to the TOV equations and nuclear astrophysics within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop at the equilibrium is used to extend the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations taking into account
  the gradient terms responsible for the system surface. The parameters of the Schwarzschild metric in the spherical case are found with these surface corrections in the
  leading (zero) order of the leptodermic approximation $a/R&lt;&lt;1$, where $a$ is the NS effective-surface (ES) thickness, and $R$ is the effective NS radius. The energy
  density $\mathcal{E}$ is considered in a general form including the functions of the particle number density and of its gradient terms. The macroscopic gravitational
  potential $\Phi(\rho)$ is taken into account in the simplest form as expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density,
  up to second order, in terms of its contributions to th separation particle energy and incompressibility. Density distributions $\rho$ across the NS ES in the normal
  direction to the ES, which are derived in the simple analytical form at the same leading approximation, was used for the derivation of the modified TOV (MTOV) equations
  by accounting for their NS surface corrections. The MTOV equations are analytically solved at first order and the results are compared with the standard TOV approach of
  the zero order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, theoretical studies on the bumblebee gravity model, a nonminimally-coupled vector-tensor theory that violates the Lorentz symmetry, have flourished, with a simultaneous increase in the utilization of observations to impose constraints. The static spherical solutions of neutron stars (NSs) in the bumblebee theory are calculated comprehensively in this work. These solutions with different coupling constants reveal a rich theoretical landscape for NSs, including vectorized NSs and NSs with finite radii but divergent masses. With these solutions, preliminary constraints on the asymptotic vector field values are obtained through restrictions on the stellar radius.</description>

The study uses Schwarzschild and a Reissner-Nordstrom metrics expanded at second post Newtonian order in the Newtonian potential, employing a semiclassical approach to compare one-loop corrections from the Standard Model with Einstein's deflection formula via an impact parameter representation. We also explore the energy dependence of deflection due to quantum corrections and integrate these with classical lens equations.</description>

      <title>Synergies in analysing binary black hole mergers: Effect of orbital eccentricity, spin-precession, and non-quadrupole modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A gravitational wave (GW) signal carries imprints of the properties of its source. The ability to extract source properties crucially depends on our prior knowledge of the signal morphology. Even though binary black hole (BBH) mergers are the cleanest system to model in general relativity, currently, there are no waveform models which include all physical effects. This thesis focuses on three subdominant effects: orbital eccentricity, spin-precession, and non-quadrupole or higher-order modes (HMs). We study the interplay of these effects on data analysis of GW signals, highlighting the shortcomings and emphasizing the need for more advanced waveforms. For instance, we investigate whether orbital eccentricity and spin-precession can mimic each other and thus caution the GW community towards the biases that may arise due to the neglect of eccentricity and/or spins in the waveform models. Using waveforms with full spin-precession and HMs, we extend the existing spin-induced quadrupole moment (SIQM) test - a null test to distinguish BBH systems from other black hole mimickers - and show that these improved waveforms give significantly better bounds. Additionally, we quantify the parameter space where the effect of HMs is most significant and show the importance of detecting these modes in GW events for future ground-based GW detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>True Unicorns and False Positives: Simulated Probabilities of Dark Massive Companions to Bright Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) exist in binaries. These binaries are normally discovered through their interactions, either from accretion as an X-ray binary or collisions as a gravitational wave source. However, the majority of compact objects in binaries should be non-interacting. Recently proposed discoveries have used radial velocities of a bright star (main sequence or evolved) that are indicative of a massive but dark companion, which is inferred to be a compact object. Unfortunately, this burgeoning new field has been hindered by false positives, including the ``Unicorn'' (V723 Mon) which was initially believed to be a red giant/black hole binary before being refuted. In this work, we investigate the evolution of stellar binary populations over time, using the binary evolution code COSMIC to simulate binary populations and determine the probability of a candidate object being either a ``true Unicorn'' (actual compact objects in binaries) or a false positive. We find that main sequence stars have a higher true Unicorn probability than red giants or naked helium stars (an exposed core of an evolved star), particularly if the companion is more massive and is &gt;3 times less luminous than the MS star. We also find that a top-heavy initial mass function raises the true Unicorn probability further, that super-solar metallicity reduces the probability, and that most true Unicorns are found at periods &lt;100 days. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of true Unicorns do not evolve into x-ray binaries during the age of the universe.</description>

      <title>On the model uncertainties for the predicted maximum depth of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantitative analysis of model uncertainties for calculations of the maximum depth of proton-initiated extensive air showers (EAS) has been performed. Staying within the standard physics picture and using the conventional approach to the treatment of high energy interactions, we found that present uncertainties on the energy dependence of the inelastic cross section, the rate of diffraction, and the inelasticity of hadronic collisions allow one to increase the predicted average EAS maximum depth by about 10 g/cm$^2$. Invoking more exotic assumptions regarding a potentially significant modification of the parton hadronization procedure by hypothetical collective effects, we were able to change drastically the predicted energy dependence of the inelasticity of proton-air interactions and to increase thereby the predicted EAS maximum depth by up to $\simeq 30$ g/cm$^2$. However, those latter modifications are disfavored by the data of the LHCf experiment, regarding forward neutron production in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and by measurements of the muon production depth by the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>Quantum maximum entropy closure for small flavor coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum angular moment transport schemes are an important avenue toward describing neutrino flavor mixing phenomena in dense astrophysical environments such as supernovae and merging neutron stars. Successful implementation will require new closure relations that go beyond those used in classical transport. In this paper, we derive the first analytic expression for a quantum M1 closure, valid in the limit of small flavor coherence, based on the maximum entropy principle. We verify that the resulting closure relation has the appropriate limits and characteristic speeds in the diffusive and free-streaming regimes. We then use this new closure in a moment linear stability analysis to search for fast flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger simulation and find better results as compared with previously designed, ad hoc, semi-classical closures.</description>

      <title>Particle Reacceleration by Turbulence and Radio Constraints on Multi-Messenger High-Energy Emission from the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04541</link>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are considered to be gigantic reservoirs of cosmic rays (CRs). Some of the clusters are found with extended radio emission, which provides evidence for the existence of magnetic fields and CR electrons in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The mechanism of radio halo (RH) emission is still under debate, and it has been believed that turbulent reacceleration plays an important role. In this paper, we study the reacceleration of CR protons and electrons in detail by numerically solving the Fokker-Planck equation, and show how radio and gamma-ray observations can be used to constrain CR distributions and resulting high-energy emission for the Coma cluster. We take into account the radial diffusion of CRs and follow the time evolution of their one-dimensional distribution, by which we investigate the radial profile of the CR injection that is consistent with the observed RH surface brightness. We find that the required injection profile is non-trivial, depending on whether CR electrons have the primary or secondary origin. Although the secondary CR electron scenario predicts larger gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, it is in tension with the observed RH spectrum. In either scenario, we find that galaxy clusters can make a sizable contribution to the all-sky neutrino intensity if the CR energy spectrum is nearly flat.</description>

      <title>Time-integrated constraint on neutrino flux of CHIME fast radio burst sources with 10-year IceCube point-source data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite numerous studies, the sources of IceCube cosmic neutrinos are mostly unidentified. Utilizing recently released IceCube neutrino and CHIME fast radio burst (FRB) catalogs, we examine the possibility of an association between neutrinos and CHIME/FRB catalog 1 FRBs for both the entire FRB population and individual FRBs using the unbinned maximum likelihood method. Our results do not directly support the possibility of the above-mentioned association with three weighting schemes: equal, total radio fluence, and event rate. We then attempt to constrain the diffuse muon neutrino flux upper limit from CHIME/FRB catalog 1 FRBs. After considering a completeness correction, we find the 95% diffuse muon neutrino flux upper limit at 100 TeV for all FRB sources in the universe to be $\sim 1.01\times10^{-18}\;\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, or $\sim 70.3\%$ of the 10-year diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube. Our results match the non-detection results of other studies, but we do not rule out FRBs being a significant contributor to the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.</description>

      <title>Bounds on ultralight bosons from the Event Horizon Telescope observation of Sgr A$^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observation of Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$) by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has uncovered various unanswered questions in black hole (BH) physics. Besides, it may also probe various beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. One of the most profound possibilities is the search for ultralight bosons (ULBs) using BH superradiance (SR). EHT observations imply that Sgr A$^*$ has a non-zero spin. Using this observation, we derive bounds on the mass of ULBs with purely gravitational interactions. Considering self-interacting ultralight axions, we constrain new regions in the parameter space of decay constant, for a certain spin of Sgr A$^*$. Future observations of various spinning BHs can improve the present constraints on ULBs.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR observation of the Vela pulsar and its nebula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of 200-ks NuSTAR observation of the Vela pulsar and the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The phase-resolved spectra corresponding to two main peaks in the folded pulse profile differ significantly. The spectrum of Peak 1 is significantly harder than that of Peak 2 in qualitative agreement with the earlier RXTE results. However, for both spectra, the values of power-law (PL) fit photon indices are noticeably larger than the previously reported values. The harder (Peak 1) spectrum has a photon index of $1.06\pm0.16$ which is close to those measured for the bright inner jets of the PWN. We used the off-pulse interval to remove the emission from the pulsar and measure the compact pulsar wind nebula (PWN) spectrum in hard X-rays. We also measured the spectrum from the south-western (SW) region of the PWN which is resolved by NuSTAR from the compact PWN. For both regions, we fit the NuSTAR spectra by themselves and together with the Chandra X-ray Observatory spectra. We found that the PWN spectrum (for both regions) requires a more complex model than a simple PL. The fits to compact PWN spectrum favor exponentially cutoff PL model, with the cutoff energy of about 50 keV, over the broken PL model. The observed synchrotron photon energies imply electrons accelerated to about 150 TeV.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays from dark matter spikes in EAGLE simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) with a mass range between $100 \, \text{M}_\odot$ and $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ are expected to be surrounded by high dark matter densities, so-called dark matter spikes. The high density of self-annihilating Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in these spikes leads to copious gamma-ray production. Sufficiently nearby IMBHs could therefore appear as unidentified gamma-ray sources. However, the number of IMBHs and their distribution within our own Milky Way is currently unknown. In this work, we provide a mock catalogue of IMBHs and their dark matter spikes obtained from the EAGLE simulations, in which black holes with a mass of $10^5 \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ are seeded into the centre of halos greater than $10^{10} \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ to model black hole feedback influencing the formation of galaxies. The catalogue contains the coordinates and dark matter spike parameters for over 2500 IMBHs present in about 150 Milky Way-like galaxies. We expect about $15^{+9}_{-6}$ IMBHs within our own galaxy, mainly distributed in the Galactic Centre and the Galactic Plane. In the most optimistic scenario, we find that current and future gamma-ray observatories, such as Fermi-LAT, H.E.S.S. and CTAO, would be sensitive enough to probe the cross section of dark matter self-annihilation around IMBHs down to many orders of magnitude below the thermal relic cross section for dark matter particles with masses from GeV to TeV. We have made the IMBH mock catalogue and the source code for our analysis publicly available, providing the resources to study dark matter self-annihilation around IMBHs with current and upcoming gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Broadband Multi-wavelength Properties of M87 during the 2018 EHT Campaign including a Very High Energy Flaring Episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nearby elliptical galaxy M87 contains one of the only two supermassive black holes whose emission surrounding the event horizon has been imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In 2018, more than two dozen multi-wavelength (MWL) facilities (from radio to gamma-ray energies) took part in the second M87 EHT campaign. The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010. The flux above 350 GeV has more than doubled within a period of about 36 hours. We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image. Our results show the value of continued MWL monitoring together with precision imaging for addressing the origins of high-energy particle acceleration. While we cannot currently pinpoint the precise location where such acceleration takes place, the new VHE gamma-ray flare already presents a challenge to simple one-zone leptonic emission model approaches, and emphasises the need for combined image and spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>New physics as a possible explanation for the Amaterasu particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Telescope Array experiment has recently reported the most energetic event detected in the hybrid technique era, with a reconstructed energy of 240 EeV, which has been named ``Amaterasu'' after the Shinto deity. Its origin is intriguing since no powerful enough candidate sources are located within the region consistent with its propagation horizon and arrival direction. In this work, we investigate the possibility of describing its origin in a scenario of new physics, specifically under a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) assumption. The kinematics of UHECR propagation under a phenomenological LIV approach is investigated. The total mean free path for a particle with Amaterasu's energy increases from a few Mpc to hundreds of Mpc for $-\delta_{\rm{had},0} &gt; 10^{-22}$, expanding significantly the region from which it could have originated. A combined fit of the spectrum and composition data of Telescope Array under different LIV assumptions was also performed. The data is best fitted with some level of LIV both with and without Amaterasu. Robustness with data from the Pierre Auger Observatory is investigated by exploring an intermediate composition scenario. Similar improvements in the description of the data with LIV are found for that. New physics in the form of LIV could, thus, provide a plausible and robust explanation for the Amaterasu particle.</description>

      <title>A detailed time-resolved and energy-resolved spectro-polarimetric study of bright GRBs detected by AstroSat CZTI in its first year of operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation mechanism underlying the prompt emission remains unresolved and can be resolved using a systematic and uniform time-resolved spectro-polarimetric study. In this paper, we investigated the spectral, temporal, and polarimetric characteristics of five bright GRBs using archival data from AstroSat CZTI, Swift BAT, and Fermi GBM. These bright GRBs were detected by CZTI in its first year of operation, and their average polarization characteristics have been published in Chattopadhyay et al. (2022). In the present work, we examined the time-resolved (in 100-600 keV) and energy-resolved polarization measurements of these GRBs with an improved polarimetric technique such as increasing the effective area and bandwidth (by using data from low-gain pixels), using an improved event selection logic to reduce noise in the double events and extend the spectral bandwidth. In addition, we also separately carried out detailed time-resolved spectral analyses of these GRBs using empirical and physical synchrotron models. By these improved time-resolved and energy-resolved spectral and polarimetric studies (not fully coupled spectro-polarimetric fitting), we could pin down the elusive prompt emission mechanism of these GRBs. Our spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals that GRB 160623A, GRB 160703A, and GRB 160821A have Poynting flux-dominated jets. On the other hand, GRB 160325A and GRB 160802A have baryonic-dominated jets with mild magnetization. Furthermore, we observe a rapid change in polarization angle by $\sim$ 90 degrees within the main pulse of very bright GRB 160821A, consistent with our previous results. Our study suggests that the jet composition of GRBs may exhibit a wide range of magnetization, which can be revealed by utilizing spectro-polarimetric investigations of the bright GRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A small fraction of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed with multiple bursts, whereas most Galactic sources emitting radio pulses are known to repeat. Here we present the results of follow-up observations of two FRBs and four rotating radio transients (RRATs). Among these, only one RRAT has been observed with repeating pulses, with an estimated period of around 1.297047 s. For comparison, we reanalysed the Parkes archival follow-up observations in CSIRO's data archive for all apparently one-off sources discovered by the Parkes telescopes, including 13 RRATs and 29 FRBs. In total, 3 RRATs are suggested to be repeaters, but no repeating signals were detected from the other sources. Reporting details of the non-detection observations for the apparently one-off sources would help investigate their origins, and catastrophic scenarios are worth proposing for both extragalactic and Galactic sources.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Alfven-Wave Dynamics and Pre-Merger Emission from Crustal Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars have solid crusts threaded by strong magnetic fields. Perturbations in the crust can excite non-radial oscillations, which can in turn launch Alfven waves into the magnetosphere. In the case of a compact binary close to merger involving at least one neutron star, this can happen through tidal interactions causing resonant excitations that shatter the neutron star crust. We present the first numerical study that elucidates the dynamics of Alfven waves launched in a compact binary magnetosphere. We seed a magnetic field perturbation on the neutron star crust, which we then evolve in fully general-relativistic force-free electrodynamics using a GPU-based implementation. We show that Alfven waves steepen nonlinearly before reaching the orbital light cylinder, form flares, and dissipate energy in a transient current sheet. Our results predict radio and X-ray precursor emission from this process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the long-term photometric and spectroscopic analysis of a transitioning SN~IIn/Ibn from $-$10.8 d to 150.7 d post $V$-band maximum. SN~2021foa shows prominent He {\sc i} lines comparable in strength to the H$\alpha$ line around peak, placing SN~2021foa between the SN~IIn and SN~Ibn populations. The spectral comparison shows that it resembles the SN~IIn population at pre-maximum, becomes intermediate between SNe~IIn/Ibn and at post-maximum matches with SN~IIn 1996al. The photometric evolution shows a precursor at $-$50 d and a light curve shoulder around 17d. The peak luminosity and color evolution of SN 2021foa are consistent with most SNe~IIn and Ibn in our comparison sample. SN~2021foa shows the unique case of a SN~IIn where the narrow P-Cygni in H$\alpha$ appear at later stages. The H$\alpha$ profile consists of a narrow (500 -- 1200 km s$^{-1}$) component, intermediate width (3000 -- 8000 km s$^{-1}$) and broad component in absorption. Temporal evolution of the H$\alpha$ profile favours a disk-like CSM geometry. Hydrodynamical modelling of the lightcurve well reproduces a two-component CSM structure with different densities ($\rho$ $\propto$ r$^{-2}$ -- $\rho$ $\propto$ r$^{-5}$), mass-loss rates (10$^{-3}$ -- 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) assuming a wind velocity of 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and having a CSM mass of 0.18 M$_{\odot}$. The overall evolution indicates that SN~2021foa most likely originated from a LBV star transitioning to a WR star with the mass-loss rate increasing in the period from 5 to 0.5 years before the explosion or it could be due to a binary interaction.</description>

      <title>Ensemble noise properties of the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The null hypothesis in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) analyses includes assumptions about ensemble properties of pulsar time-correlated noise. These properties are encoded in prior probabilities for the amplitude and the spectral index of the power-law power spectral density of temporal correlations of the noise. In this work, we introduce a new procedure for numerical marginalisation over the uncertainties in pulsar noise priors. The procedure may be used in searches for nanohertz gravitational waves and other PTA analyses to resolve prior misspecification at negligible computational cost. Furthermore, we infer the distribution of amplitudes and spectral indices of the power spectral density of spin noise and dispersion measure variation noise based on the observation of 25 millisecond pulsars by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). Our results may be used for the simulation of realistic noise in PTAs.</description>

      <title>Effects of Phi and $\sigma^{*}$-meson on properties of hyperon stars including $\Delta$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00007v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of neutron stars using the linear Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory and consider multiple degrees of freedom inside neutron stars, including hyperons and $\Delta$ resonances. We investigate different coupling parameters $x_{\sigma \Delta}$ between $\Delta$ resonances and nucleons and compare the differences between neutron stars with and without strange mesons $\sigma^*$ and $\phi$. These effects include particle number distributions, equations of state (EOS), mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. To overcome the "hyperon puzzle," we employ the $\sigma-cut$ scheme to obtain neutron stars with masses up to $2M_{\odot}$. We find that strange mesons appear at around 3$\rho_0$ and reduce the critical density of baryons in the high-density region. With increasing coupling parameter $x_{\sigma \Delta}$, the $\Delta$ resonances suppress hyperons, leading to a shift of the critical density towards lower values. The early appearance of $\Delta$ resonances may play a crucial role in the stability of neutron stars. Strange mesons soften the EOS slightly, while $\Delta$ resonances predominantly soften the EOS in the low-density region. By calculating tidal deformabilities and comparing with astronomical observation GW170817, we find that the inclusion of $\Delta$ resonances decreases the radius of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Nulling and Vacuum Radio Emission from Axion Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic axions can be efficiently produced in in the polar caps of pulsars, resulting in the formation of a dense cloud of gravitationally bound axions. Here, we investigate the interplay between such an axion cloud and the electrodynamics in the pulsar magnetosphere, focusing specifically on the dynamics in the polar caps, where the impact of the axion cloud is expected to be most pronounced. For sufficiently light axions $m_a \lesssim 10^{-7}$ eV, we show that the axion cloud can occasionally screen the local electric field responsible for particle acceleration and pair production, inducing a periodic nulling of the pulsar's intrinsic radio emission. At larger axion masses, the small-scale fluctuations in the axion field tend to suppress the back-reaction of the axion on the electrodynamics; however, we point out that the incoherent oscillations of the axion in short-lived regions of vacuum near the neutron star surface can produce a narrow radio line, which provides a complementary source of radio emission to the plasma-resonant emission processes identified in previous work. While this work focuses on the leading order correction to pair production in the magnetosphere, we speculate that there can exist dramatic deviations in the electrodynamics of these systems when the axion back-reaction becomes non-linear.</description>

      <title>Coexistence Test of Primordial Black Holes and Particle Dark Matter from Diffractive Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such ``dressed PBHs'' (dPBHs) are subject to modified constraints compared to PBHs and can contribute to significant DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} - 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to definitively establish the coexistence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</description>

      <title>New 511 keV line data provides strongest sub-GeV dark matter constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the $511$~keV emission associated to sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles that can produce electron-positron pairs and form positronium after thermalizing. We use $\sim16$~yr of SPI data from INTEGRAL to constrain DM properties, considering the full positron propagation and losses, and the free electron density drop away from the Galactic plane. We show that the predicted longitude and latitude profiles vary significantly for different DM masses, unlike previous assumptions, and obtain the strongest limits on sub-GeV DM (from the MeV to a few GeV) so far, excluding cross-sections down to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim10^{-32}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for $m_{\chi}\sim1\,\text{MeV}$ and $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1} $ for $m_{\chi}\sim5\,\text{GeV}$ and lifetimes up to $\tau \gtrsim 10^{29}\, \textrm{s} \, (m_{\chi}\sim1\,\text{MeV}) $ and $\tau \gtrsim 10^{27}\,\textrm{s}$ ($m_{\chi}\sim5$~GeV) for the typical Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile. Our derived limits are robust within a factor of a few due to systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of weakly collisional plasma: continuous spectra, discrete eigenmodes, and the decay of echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of a weakly collisional plasma is described by the Boltzmann-Poisson equations with the Lenard-Bernstein collision operator. We perform a perturbative analysis of these equations, and obtain exact analytic solutions, enabling definitive resolutions to long-standing controversies regarding the impact of weak collisions on continuous spectra and Landau eigenmodes. Unlike some previous studies, we retain both damping and diffusion terms in the collision operator. We find that the linear response is a temporal convolution of a continuum that depends on the continuous velocities of particles, and discrete modes that encapsulate coherent oscillations. The discrete modes are exponentially damped over time due to collective effects (Landau damping) as well as collisional dissipation. The continuum is also damped by collisions but somewhat differently. Up to a collision time, which is the inverse of the collision frequency $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$, the continuum decay is driven by velocity diffusion and occurs super-exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu^{-1/3}_{\mathrm{c}}$. After a collision time, however, the continuum decay is driven by the collisional damping of particle velocities and diffusion of their positions, and occurs exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu_{\mathrm{c}}$. This hitherto unknown, slow exponential decay causes perturbations to damp the most on scales comparable to the mean free path, but very slowly on larger scales, which establishes the local thermal equilibrium, the essence of the fluid limit. The long-term decay of the response is driven by the discrete modes on scales smaller than the mean free path, but, on larger scales, is governed by the slowly decaying continuum and the least damped discrete mode. Our analysis firmly establishes a long-sought connection between the collisionless and fluid limits of weakly collisional plasmas.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 &lt; a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 &lt; a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmic strings via black hole spin-down</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings that are attached to rapidly spinning black holes can extract significant amounts of rotational energy and angular momentum. Here we study the effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or more cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are predicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that cosmic strings will spin them down again. We show that if there are cosmic strings with tension greater than $10^{-20}$, the spins of large primordial black holes of mass greater than $30 M_\odot$ should consequently be observed to be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of capturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin down by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of two-color superconducting quark matter in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bulk viscosity of moderately hot and dense,
  neutrino-transparent color superconducting quark matter arising from
  weak-interaction-driven direct URCA processes. The quark matter is
  modeled using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model improved to account for
  vector and 't Hooft interactions as well as antisymmetric pairing
  among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired excitations
  are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute
  the relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and
  electron capture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The
  resulting bulk viscosity for density oscillations in the 1--10\,kHz
  range shows a resonant peak at $T\sim 5\,\MeV$, and the damping time
  may drop below 10 ms. This is short enough to affect the
  postmerger evolution and is very similar to the damping predicted
  in nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>DarkMatters: A powerful tool for WIMPy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new software package, DarkMatters, which has been designed to facilitate the calculation of all aspects of indirect dark matter detection of WIMPs in astrophysical settings. Two primary features of this code are the improvement in performance compared to existing tools, and higher levels of accuracy when determining radio synchrotron emission associated with WIMP annihilations, both of which are enabled by the employment of a set of modern and novel numerical techniques. The code also includes functionality for a multi-wavelength set of output products including gamma-ray, radio and neutrino fluxes which can be saved in common formats used by the astronomical community, such as the FITS data file format. The calculations may be tailored to work with a wide range of astrophysical target structures, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, and the configuration of the underlying calculations is managed by a set of key-value dictionary entries that are easy to understand and use. The code base is publicly accessible through an online repository with a permissive MIT source code licence.</description>
