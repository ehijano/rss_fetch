      <title>Verifiability and Limit Consistency of Eddy Viscosity Large Eddy Simulation Reduced Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large eddy simulation reduced order models (LES-ROMs) are ROMs that leverage LES ideas (e.g., filtering and closure modeling) to construct accurate and efficient ROMs for convection-dominated (e.g., turbulent) flows. Eddy viscosity (EV) ROMs (e.g., Smagorinsky ROM (S-ROM)) are LES-ROMs whose closure model consists of a diffusion-like operator in which the viscosity depends on the ROM velocity. We propose the Ladyzhenskaya ROM (L-ROM), which is a generalization of the S-ROM. Furthermore, we prove two fundamental numerical analysis results for the new L-ROM and the classical S-ROM: (i) We prove the verifiability of the L-ROM and S-ROM, i.e, that the ROM error is bounded (up to a constant) by the ROM closure error. (ii) We introduce the concept of ROM limit consistency (in a discrete sense), and prove that the L-ROM and S-ROM are limit consistent, i.e., that as the ROM dimension approaches the rank of the snapshot matrix, $d$, and the ROM lengthscale goes to zero, the ROM solution converges to the \emph{``true solution"}, i.e., the solution of the $d$-dimensional ROM. Finally, we illustrate numerically the verifiability and limit consistency of the new L-ROM and S-ROM in two under-resolved convection-dominated problems that display sharp gradients: (i) the 1D Burgers equation with a small diffusion coefficient; and (ii) the 2D lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number $Re=15,000$.</description>

      <title>Droplet encapsulating bubble: Investigation of droplet spreading dynamics and bubble encapsulation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary interactions between hetero-fluid particles, particularly the dynamics of droplets spreading over curved fluid interfaces remain insufficiently understood compared to the two-phase coalescence. In this study, we combine lattice Boltzmann simulations, high-speed imaging, and theoretical scaling to investigate the collision and encapsulation of an air bubble by a rising oil droplet in an immiscible medium. We systematically vary fluid properties, droplet-to-bubble size ratios, and collision configurations to quantify their impact on encapsulation time and flow evolution. The process unfolds in four stages: collision/film drainage, encapsulation, reshaping, and compound rising. Results indicate that encapsulation time increases exponentially with viscosity and is strongly modulated by the spreading coefficient (So), which governs the imbalance of interfacial tensions. Higher So values enhance capillary-driven spreading and reduce engulfment time, while lower values yield coupled deformation-reshaping behavior, introducing oscillations in bubble velocity and shape evolution. For low viscosity drops (Oh&lt;0.1), the neck growth rate follows the well-known power-low relation with an exponent of 0.44-0.5, dependent on the size ratio. The transition between the spherical and deformed regimes is identified. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in low Bond numbers (Bo&lt;0.11), spreading speed scales with viscous-capillary velocity, while in the deformed regime (0.11&lt;Bo&lt;2.2), encapsulation time follows a capillary-gravitational timescale. Interestingly, smaller droplets expedite encapsulation in equal-sized collisions but delay it in size-mismatched pairs, despite a faster initial neck growth. These findings provide new mechanistic insight into three-fluid interactions and offer guidance for optimizing encapsulation processes in applications such as gas flotation and interfacial microfluidics.</description>

      <title>A numerical demonstration of dynamic stall control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical demonstration of the real-time application of two dynamic stall onset criteria for identifying and mitigating stall. These criteria - based on the leading-edge suction parameter (LESP) and boundary enstrophy flux (BEF) - are derived from prior research. The present work establishes a proof of concept for the practical use of these indicators in mitigating dynamic stall. Two different unsteady motions that lead to dynamic stall are simulated. For each motion, both baseline cases (where dynamic stall occurs) and controlled cases (where stall is mitigated using the onset criteria) are analyzed using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (uRANS) method. Both parameters were found to be effective in mitigating the adverse effects (large variations in aerodynamic loads) of dynamic stall. The results demonstrate the potential for these physics-based criteria to be integrated with advanced control strategies, such as reinforcement learning agents, for robust stall control across a range of operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics During Pinch-off of Micro-Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro droplets are extensively used in chemical, biological, and medical research, primarily for conducting various tests on samples, including living organisms, using a microfluidic framework. Recent studies have shown that the physiology of bacteria can be significantly altered when subjected to shear and/or extensional stresses. With this motivation, we perform experiments to understand the vortex dynamics involved during the pinch-off process in a cross flow droplet generator, using particle image velocimetry (PIV) to visualize the vortical structures and to quantitatively measure the associated stresses developed inside droplets. The process of pinching off inherently leads to bi-directional acceleration of fluid in the rapidly thinning capillary bridge, resulting in a vortex in the separated droplet as well as in the retracting ligament. We propose scaling laws for the vortical flow inside the droplet post pinch-off and predict the maximum circulation production inside droplet. Further, we discuss the vortex dynamics inside the droplet, the retracting ligament and the advancing ligament and examine the stress fields associated with this transient phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Competition Between Thermophoretic Separation and Thermal Convective Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary fluid systems under temperature differences, thermophoretic separation and thermal convective mixing are two key mechanisms that affect the processes of transport. The thermophoretic effect, also known as the Soret effect, describes the migration behavior of molecules in the fluid with temperature gradient. Thermophilic and thermophobic molecules tend to migrate to regions of higher and lower temperature. Thermal convective mixing is triggered by a Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard-type hydrodynamics instability as a macroscopic flow caused by buoyancy induced by temperature differences, promoting the mixing of different components within the fluid. There is a competition between the separation caused by thermophoresis and the mixing produced by convection. A dimensionless number, namely Soret-Rayleigh number $S_R$, which is the ratio of dimensionless Soret factor $S_T$ and Rayleigh numbers $Ra$, is introduced to quantitatively describe this competition. The impact of different $S_R$ and Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ on the concentration field is studied by energy-conserving dissipative particle dynamics (eDPD). The results indicate that the components separation exhibits a non-monotonic variation with $Ra$ increase. For a specific $S_R$, there exists an optimal $Ra$ that achieves the lowest separation at long time scales. This result will have potential implications for the design and application of micro-mixers.</description>

      <title>DNS and role of round-off error: Two-Dimensional Taylor-Green vortex problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of round-off errors on the receptivity and instability of fluid flows are conclusively established for the first time using high accuracy simulations of the benchmark two-dimensional (2D) Taylor-Green vortex problem using double and quadruple precisions. Employing the fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method for temporal discretization and Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization enables unprecedented accuracy necessary for controlling all forms of errors, except the remaining round-off error. Results clearly show that adopting quadruple precision results in a qualitatively different receptivity route to turbulence and its subsequent decay compared to double precision. Another important observation is the identification of the receptivity phase which has never been reported before. Present study not only establishes the singular role of round-off errors but also has potential ramifications on receptivity and instability of flows due to precision of simulation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of cohesive particle deagglomeration in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using particle-resolved DNS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, agglomerate breakage in homogeneous isotropic turbulence is investigated using particle-resolved direct numerical simulations. Single agglomerates composed of 500 monodisperse spherical particles are considered, and their interaction with the turbulent flow is resolved through an immersed boundary method coupled with a soft-sphere discrete element model. A range of Reynolds numbers and cohesion levels is examined to assess their influence on the breakup behavior. Detailed insights into the underlying breakage mechanisms are provided through the analysis of local flow structures and fluid stresses. Strain-dominated regions are identified as the primary contributors to the onset and propagation of particle erosion. The benefits of the particle-resolved simulation framework in capturing these physical processes in detail are demonstrated. The predicted fragment size distributions and breakup modes are analyzed leading to the outcome that erosion-driven breakage is the dominating mechanism. The time evolution of the fragment number and the main agglomerate structure is quantified. The breakage rate is evaluated and its dependence on the modified adhesion number is established, showing a power-law decay that agrees with general trends reported in the literature. In addition, the analysis of the fragment ejection direction reveals a strong alignment with the local deformation plane spanned by the most extensional and compressive strain-rate eigenvectors, indicating that breakage results from the interplay between flow stretching and compression. The results contribute to the development of physics-informed breakup kernels for use in efficient but less-detailed simulation approaches such as point-particle Euler--Lagrange predictions with agglomerates represented by effective spheres or Euler--Euler simulations.</description>

      <title>Reconsiderations about inner layer of wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following recent evidence that even ZPG boundary layers do not exhibit a purely logarithmic extended overlap region, reconsideration of recently advanced logarithmic plus linear extended overlap region in wall-bounded flows leads to a revision of the model for the extended overlap region. The significant difference between the two representations is a separation between the inner layer and the extended overlap layer in the coefficient of the logarithmic term into $\kappa_{in}$ and k_o, respectively. From a wide range of data examined in wall-bounded flows, the value of k_in is universal and equal to 1/2.6 or in the range 0.38&lt;k_in&lt;0.39. The value of k_o depends on the pressure gradient imposed by the flow geometry. In regard to the trends of the streamwise normal stress, recent publications concluded that the defect-power model developed from bounded dissipation is in more agreement with experimental data from ZPG boundary layers and pipe flows, as well as DNS data for channel and pipe flows, than the logarithmic model developed with inviscid analysis based on wall-scaled eddies. For some recent investigations and the entire previous literature on this popular topic, the assessment is made in the overlap region between inner and outer flows, which has limited viscous effects and is essentially inviscid; i.e., y+_in&gt;400 and Y_out~0.45. This appears to be counterintuitive and deserves further attention. Here, both models are reevaluated using the same data sets from recent investigations in a region closer to the wall but outside the region with viscous stresses exceeding 20% of the total stress; i.e., dominated by viscous effects. It is perplexing that both an inviscid and a viscous model agree equally well with experiments and DNS data in this region closer to the wall.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian calibration and uncertainty quantification of RANS turbulence model parameters for stratified atmospheric boundary layer flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In operational weather models, the effects of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) on the resolved flow are modeled using turbulence parameterizations. These parameterizations typically use a predetermined set of model parameters that are tuned to limited data from canonical flows. Using these fixed parameters results in deterministic predictions that neglect uncertainty in the unresolved turbulence processes. In this study, we perform a machine learning-accelerated Bayesian inversion of a single-column model of the ABL. This approach is used to calibrate and quantify uncertainty in model parameters of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models. Following verification of the uncertainty quantification methodology, we learn the parameters and their uncertainties in two different turbulence models conditioned on scale-resolving large-eddy simulation data over a range of ABL stabilities. We show how Bayesian inversion of a numerical model improves flow predictions by investigating the underlying mean momentum budgets. Further, we show that uncertainty quantification based on neutral surface layer data recovers the relationships between parameters derived from theoretical modeling, but that learning the parameters based on stable ABL data or data from outside the surface layer can lead to different relationships than neutral surface layer theory. Systematic uncertainty reduction methods reveal that (1) sampling wind speed up to the ABL height can reduce uncertainty in key model parameters by up to 84%, and (2) assimilating fluid flow quantities beyond first-order moment statistics can further reduce uncertainty in ways that wind speed assimilation alone cannot achieve. The parameters learned using Bayesian uncertainty quantification generally yield lower error than standard deterministic parameters in out-of-sample tests and provide uncertainty intervals on predictions.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of ridge-induced secondary motions in turbulent channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many engineering and environmental surfaces exhibit spatial heterogeneity in the spanwise direction and encompass multiple surface length scales. When the dominant spanwise length scale is on the order of the largest flow scales (e.g., the boundary layer thickness or channel half-height, delta), localized delta-scale secondary flows can form. These secondary-flow generating heterogeneous surfaces are typically classified as "ridge-type" (with spanwise variation in surface elevation) and "strip-type" (spanwise variation in skin-friction including through variation in roughness characteristics). Both types of surfaces have been explored in previous studies at high Reynolds numbers using experiments with focus on a variety of characteristics such as mean flow, turbulent statistics and structure, while lower Reynolds number studies in channels have examined influence on skin-friction in addition to flow characteristics and mechanisms. In this work, we augment the previous work through experiments on ridge-type roughness in turbulent channel flows over a large range of Reynolds numbers. Our findings reveal that the global skin friction, as inferred through pressure drop in the channel along the streamwise direction, of these surfaces exhibits a log-linear asymptotic behaviour that is characteristic of a fully-rough surface at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. Yet, the roughness function where this is observed is "low" compared to other established homogeneous rough surfaces. Moreover, the mean flow, turbulent statistics, and two-point correlation analyses indicate that the secondary flow structure, spatial extent, and magnitude remain largely invariant over the Reynolds number range considered. These findings have important implications on predicting drag of these heterogeneous surfaces as well as developing new models for the flow structure.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of theapplicability of Schr\"odinger-variant equations for classical fluid dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The artificial fluid model known as "Schr\"odinger flow" (SF) can represent rotational flow with dissipative effects, and has attracted attention despite its gap from real-world fluid behavior. To address the structural discrepancy arising from the incomplete transition from quantum hydrodynamics to classical fluid dynamics, we propose a variant of the hydrodynamic Schr\"odinger equation (HSE) that better aligns with classical formulations. We then revisit an alternative method for eliminating the quantum potential (referred to in this work as the "cancellation approach") in light of the known non-universality of the classical limit. Beyond examining conservation laws via Lagrangian field theory, we identify its deeper connection to a generalized Lagrangian field theory, which offers a more straightforward route to constructing a Lagrangian density in terms of the components of a two-component wave function for rotational inviscid flow. Finally, we discuss the completeness of Clebsch parameterization, concluding our evaluation of the applicability of the proposed SF-variant formulation.</description>

      <title>Developing a Numerical Framework for the High-Fidelity Simulation of Contrails: Sensitivity Analysis for Conventional Contrails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrails have recently gained widespread attention due to their large and uncertain estimates of effective radiative forcing, i.e., warming effect on the planet, comparable to those of carbon dioxide. To study this aircraft-induced cloud formation in the context of current conventional fuels and future alternative fuels, we have developed a numerical framework for simulating the jet and early vortex interaction phases of contrail formation.
  Our approach consists of high-fidelity, 3D large-eddy simulations (LES) of an Eulerian-Lagrangian two-phase flow using the compressible flow solver charLES. We perform temporal simulations of the early contrail formation phases for a single linear contrail and compare the sensitivity of the results to modeling choices and atmospheric, aircraft, and engine parameters.
  Specifically, we discuss how these choices and parameters affect the number of nucleated ice crystals and estimated net radiative forcing (based on an optical depth parameterization). Our simulations show the most significant sensitivity to the aircraft size, followed by the soot number emission index and fuel consumption. Adding atmospheric aerosol as a precursor for future studies of sustainable fuels evidences a non-linear relation previously highlighted in the literature between number of emitted soot and nucleated ice crystals.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Turbulence Anisotropy Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the generalization performance and representation efficiency (parsimony) of a previously introduced Tensor Basis Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TBKAN) architecture for data-driven turbulence modeling. The TBKAN framework replaces the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) used in either the standard or modified Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN) with a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), which significantly reduces the model complexity while providing a structure that potentially can be used with symbolic regression to provide a physical interpretability that is not available in a 'black box' MLP. While some prior work demonstrated TBKAN's feasibility for modeling a 'simple' flat plate boundary layer flow, this study extends the TBKAN architecture to model more complex benchmark flows, in particular, square duct and periodic hills flows which exhibit strong turbulence anisotropy, secondary motion, and flow separation and reattachment. A realizability-informed loss function is employed to constrain the model predictions, and, for the first time, TBKAN predictions are stably injected into the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to provide it a posteriori predictions of the mean velocity field.</description>

      <title>Role of settling inertial particles in modulating flow structures and drag in Taylor-Couette turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modulation of drag through dispersed phases in wall turbulence has been a longstanding focus. This study examines the effects of particle Stokes number ($St$) and Froude number ($Fr$) on drag modulation in turbulent Taylor-Couette (TC) flow, using a two-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach with Reynolds number $Re_i = r_i \omega_i d/\nu$ fixed at 3500. For light particles (small $St$), drag reduction is observed in the TC system, exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on $Fr$. In specific, drag reduction initially increases and then decreases with stronger influence of gravitational settling (characterized by inverse of $Fr$), indicating the presence of an optimal $Fr$ for maximum drag reduction. For heavy particles, similar non-monotonic trend can also be observed, but significant drag enhancement is resulted at large $Fr^{-1}$. We further elucidate the role of settling particles in modulating the flow structure in TC by decomposing the advective flux into contributions from coherent Taylor vortices and background turbulent fluctuations. At moderate effects of particle inertia and gravitational settling, particles suppress the coherence of Taylor vortices which remarkably reduces angular velocity transport and thus leads to drag reduction. However, with increasing influence of particle inertia and gravitational settling, the flow undergoes abrupt change. Rapidly settling particles disrupt the Taylor vortices, shifting the bulk flow from a vortex-dominated regime to one characterized by particle-induced turbulence. With the dominance by particle-induced turbulence, velocity plumes -- initially transported by small-scale G{\"{o}}rtler vortices near the cylinder wall and large-scale Taylor vortices in bulk region -- are instead carried into the bulk by turbulent fluctuations driven by the settling particles.</description>

      <title>Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction Dynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Immersed Boundary Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce neural network architectures that combine physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the immersed boundary method (IBM) to solve fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. Our approach features two distinct architectures: a Single-FSI network with a unified parameter space, and an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian network that maintains separate parameter spaces for fluid and structure domains. We study each architecture using standard Tanh and adaptive B-spline activation functions. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that the Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture performs significantly better. The adaptive B-spline activation further enhances accuracy by providing locality-aware representation near boundaries. While our methodology shows promising results in predicting the velocity field, pressure recovery remains challenging due to the absence of explicit force-coupling constraints in the current formulation. Our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific architectural design and adaptive activation functions for modeling FSI problems within the PINN framework.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Neural-MPM for Interactive Fluid Simulations in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural physics system for real-time, interactive fluid simulations. Traditional physics-based methods, while accurate, are computationally intensive and suffer from latency issues. Recent machine-learning methods reduce computational costs while preserving fidelity; yet most still fail to satisfy the latency constraints for real-time use and lack support for interactive applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel hybrid method that integrates numerical simulation, neural physics, and generative control. Our neural physics jointly pursues low-latency simulation and high physical fidelity by employing a fallback safeguard to classical numerical solvers. Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based controller that is trained using a reverse modeling strategy to generate external dynamic force fields for fluid manipulation. Our system demonstrates robust performance across diverse 2D/3D scenarios, material types, and obstacle interactions, achieving real-time simulations at high frame rates (11~29% latency) while enabling fluid control guided by user-friendly freehand sketches. We present a significant step towards practical, controllable, and physically plausible fluid simulations for real-time interactive applications. We promise to release both models and data upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Turb-L1: Achieving Long-term Turbulence Tracing By Tackling Spectral Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications. However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle. Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$ compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity. (II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions, thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in other methods.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the intrinsic inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to problems involving the dynamics of interfaces of two immiscible fluids. A boundary Poisson bracket, which appears to be new and related to the KdV bracket, is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative $\partial / \partial s$. Lagrangian invariants of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--are also derived.</description>

      <title>Aerosol deposition in mucus-lined ciliated airways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transport and deposition of inhaled aerosols in a mid-generation, mucus-lined lung airway, with the aim of understanding if and how airborne particles can avoid the mucus and deposit on the airway wall -- an outcome that is harmful in case of allergens and pathogens but beneficial in case of aerosolized drugs. We adopt the weighted-residual integral boundary-layer model of Dietze and Ruyer-Quil (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 762, 2015, pp. 68-109) to describe the dynamics of the mucus-air interface, as well as the flow in both phases. The transport of mucus induced by wall-attached cilia is also considered, via a coarse-grained boundary condition at the base of the mucus. We show that the capillary-driven Rayleigh-Plateau instability plays an important role in particle deposition by drawing the mucus into large annular humps and leaving substantial areas of the wall exposed to particles. We find, counter-intuitively, that these mucus-depleted zones enlarge on increasing the mucus volume fraction. Particles spanning a range of sizes (0.1 to 50 microns) are modelled using the Maxey-Riley equation, augmented with Brownian forces. We find a non-monotonic dependence of deposition on size. Small particles diffuse across streamlines due to Brownian motion, while large particles are thrown off streamlines by inertial forces -- particularly when air flows past mucus humps. Intermediate-sized particles are tracer-like and deposit the least. Remarkably, increasing the mucus volume need not increase entrapment: the effect depends on particle-size, because more mucus produces not only deeper humps that intercept inertial particles, but also larger depleted-zones that enable diffusive particles to deposit on the wall.</description>

      <title>Energetic consistency and heat transport in Fourier-Galerkin truncations of free slip 3D rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of energetic consistency in Fourier truncated models of the 3D Boussinesq-Coriolis (BC) equations as a case-study towards improving the realism of convective processes in climate models. As a benchmark we consider the Nusselt number, defined as the average vertical heat transport of a convective flow. A set of formulae are derived which give the ODE projection of the BC model onto any finite selection of modes. It is proven that projected ODE models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE if and only if a mode selection Criterion regarding the vertical resolution is satisfied. It is also proven that the energy relations imply the existence of a compact attractor for these ODE's, which then implies bounds on the Nusselt number. By contrast, it is proven that a broad class of energetically inconsistent models admit solutions with unbounded, exponential growth, precluding the existence of a compact attractor and giving an infinite Nusselt number. On the other hand, certain energetically inconsistent models can admit compact attractors as shown via a simple model. The above formulas are implemented in MATLAB, enabling a user to study any desired Fourier truncated model by selecting a desired finite set of Fourier modes. All code is made available on GitHub. Several numerical studies of the Nusselt number are conducted to assess the convergence of the Nusselt number with respect to increasing spatial resolution for consistent models and measure the distorting effects of inconsistency for more general solutions.</description>

      <title>Fusion-DeepONet: A Data-Efficient Neural Operator for Geometry-Dependent Hypersonic and Supersonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape optimization is essential in aerospace vehicle design, including reentry systems, and propulsion system components, as it directly influences aerodynamic efficiency, structural integrity, and overall mission success. Rapid and accurate prediction of external and internal flows accelerates design iterations. To this end, we develop a new variant of DeepONet, called Fusion-DeepONet as a fast surrogate model for geometry-dependent hypersonic and supersonic flow fields. We evaluated Fusion-DeepONet in learning two external hypersonic flows and a supersonic shape-dependent internal flow problem. First, we compare the performance of Fusion-DeepONet with state-of-the-art neural operators to learn inviscid hypersonic flow around semi-elliptic blunt bodies for two grid types: uniform Cartesian and irregular grids. Fusion-DeepONet provides comparable accuracy to parameter-conditioned U-Net on uniform grids while outperforming MeshGraphNet and Vanilla-DeepONet on irregular grids. Fusion-DeepONet requires significantly fewer trainable parameters than U-Net, MeshGraphNet, and FNO. For the second hypersonic problem, we set up Fusion-DeepONet to map from geometry and free stream Mach number to the temperature field around a reentry capsule traveling at hypersonic speed. This fast surrogate is then improved to predict the spatial derivative of the temperature, resulting in an accurate prediction of heat flux at the surfaces of the capsule. To enhance the accuracy of spatial derivative prediction, we introduce a derivative-enhanced loss term with the least computation overhead. For the third problem, we show that Fusion-DeepONet outperforms MeshGraphNet in learning geometry-dependent supersonic flow in a converging-diverging nozzle configuration. For all the problems, we used high-fidelity simulations with a high-order entropy-stable DGSEM solver to generate training datasets with limited samples.</description>
