      <title>Distribution of the number of prime factors with a given multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $k\ge2$, let $\omega_k(n)$ denote the number of primes that divide $n$ with multiplicity exactly $k$. We compute the density $e_{k,m}$ of those integers $n$ for which $\omega_k(n)=m$ for every integer $m\ge0$. We also show that the generating function $\sum_{m=0}^\infty e_{k,m}z^m$ is an entire function that can be written in the form $\prod_{p} \bigl(1+{(p-1)(z-1)}/{p^{k+1}} \bigr)$; from this representation we show how to both numerically calculate the $e_{k,m}$ to high precision and provide an asymptotic upper bound for the $e_{k,m}$. We further show how to generalize these results to all additive functions of the form $\sum_{j=2}^\infty a_j \omega_j(n)$; when $a_j=j-1$ this recovers a classical result of R\'enyi on the distribution of $\Omega(n)-\omega(n)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the auxiliary function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Siegel in 1932 published a paper on Riemann's posthumous writings, including a study of the Riemann-Siegel formula. In this paper we explicitly give the asymptotic developments of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$ suggested by Siegel. We extend the range of validity of these asymptotic developments. As a consequence we specify a region in which the function $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$ has no zeros. We also give complete proofs of some of Siegel's assertions.
  We also include a theorem on the asymptotic behaviour of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(\frac12-it)$ for $t \to+\infty$. Although the real part of $e^{-i\vartheta(t)}\mathop{\mathcal R }(\frac12-it)$ is $Z(t)$ the imaginary part grows exponentially, this is why for the study of the zeros of $Z(t)$ it is preferable to consider $\mathop{\mathcal R }(\frac12+it)$ for $t&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>On the $abc$ and the $abcd$ conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a subexponential bound for the $abc$ conjecture due to the first author, and we establish a variation of it using linear forms in logarithms. As an application, we prove an unconditional subexponential bound towards the $4$-terms $abc$ conjecture under a suitable hypothesis on the size of the variables.</description>

      <title>From Worst to Average Case to Incremental Search Bounds of the Strong Lucas Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong Lucas test is a widely used probabilistic primality test in cryptographic libraries. When combined with the Miller-Rabin primality test, it forms the Baillie-PSW primality test, known for its absence of false positives, undermining the relevance of a complete understanding of the strong Lucas test. In primality testing, the worst-case error probability serves as an upper bound on the likelihood of incorrectly identifying a composite as prime. For the strong Lucas test, this bound is $4/15$ for odd composites, not products of twin primes. On the other hand, the average-case error probability indicates the probability that a randomly chosen integer is inaccurately classified as prime by the test. This bound is especially important for practical applications, where we test primes that are randomly generated and not generated by an adversary. The error probability of $4/15$ does not directly carry over due to the scarcity of primes, and whether this estimate holds has not yet been established in the literature. This paper addresses this gap by demonstrating that an integer passing $t$ consecutive test rounds, alongside additional standard tests of low computational cost, is indeed prime with a probability greater than $1-(4/15)^t$ for all $t\geq 1$. Furthermore, we introduce error bounds for the incremental search algorithm based on the strong Lucas test, as there are no established bounds up to date as well. Rather than independent selection, in this approach, the candidate is chosen uniformly at random, with subsequent candidates determined by incrementally adding 2. This modification reduces the need for random bits and enhances the efficiency of trial division computation further.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian base change for symmetric power liftings of holomorphic modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a non-CM Hecke eigenform of weight $k \geq 2$. We give a new proof of some cases of Langlands functoriality for the automorphic representation $\pi$ associated to $f$. More precisely, we prove the existence of the base change lifting, with respect to any totally real extension $F / \mathbb{Q}$, of any symmetric power lifting of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Advances in Tabulating Carmichael Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report that there are $49679873$ Carmichael numbers less than $10^{22}$ which is an order of magnitude improvement on the previous bound. The tabulation finds Carmichael numbers of the form $n = Pqr$ and is bifurcated by the size of $P$ with respect to the tabulation bound $B$. For $P &lt; 7 \cdot 10^7$, we found $35985331$ Carmichael numbers and $1202914$ of them were less than $10^{22}$. When $P &gt; 7 \cdot 10^7$, we found $48476959$ Carmichael numbers less than $10^{22}$. We provide a comprehensive overview of both cases of the algorithm. For the large case, we show and implement asymptotically faster ways to tabulate compared to the prior tabulation. We also provide an asymptotic estimate of the cost of this algorithm. It is interesting that Carmichael numbers are worst case inputs to this algorithm. So, providing a more robust asymptotic analysis of the cost of the algorithm would likely require resolution of long-standing open questions regarding the asymptotic density of Carmichael numbers.</description>

      <title>Rational approximation of Euler's constant using multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new rational approximants of Euler's constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007) and Rivoal (2009). The approximants are given in terms of certain (mixed type) multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the exponential integral. The dual family of multiple orthogonal polynomials leads to new rational approximants of the Gompertz constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007). Our approach is motivated by the fact that we can reformulate Rivoal's construction in terms of type I multiple Laguerre polynomials of the first kind by making use of the underlying Riemann-Hilbert problem. As a consequence, we can drastically simplify Rivoal's approach, which allows us to study the Diophantine and asymptotic properties of the approximants more easily.</description>

      <title>Algebraic integers with continued fraction expansions containing palindromes and square roots with prescribed periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a characterization of the algebraic integers with continued fraction expansions of the form $[a_0, \overline{a_1, \ldots, a_n, s}]$, where $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ is a palindrome and $s \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}$. In particular, we focus on the special case where $(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = (m, \ldots, m)$, providing a detailed characterizations of the corresponding algebraic integers and $s$ in terms of Fibonacci polynomials. Then, we derive new expansions of square roots of integers with these periods, given $m$ and $n$. Moreover, we explicitly determine the fundamental solutions of both positive and negative Pell's equations corresponding to this family of integers.</description>

      <title>Primitive normal pairs with prescribed traces over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a positive integral power of some prime $p$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ be a finite field with $q^m$ elements for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Here we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of primitive normal pairs of the type $(\epsilon, f(\epsilon))$ in $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with two prescribed traces, $Tr_{{\mathbb{F}_{q^m}}/{\mathbb{F}_q}}(\epsilon)=a$ and $Tr_{{\mathbb{F}_{q^m}}/{\mathbb{F}_q}}(f(\epsilon))=b$, where $f(x) \in \mathbb{F}_{q^m}(x)$ is a rational function with some restrictions and $a, b \in \mathbb{F}_q$. Furthermore, for $q=5^k$, $m \geq 9$ and rational functions with degree sum 4, we explicitly find at most 12 fields in which the desired pair may not exist.</description>
