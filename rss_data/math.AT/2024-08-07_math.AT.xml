      <title>Non-null framed bordant simple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact simple Lie group equipped with the left invariant framing $L$. It is known that there are several groups $G$ such that $(G, L)$ is non-null framed bordant. Previously we gave an alternative proof of these results using the decomposition formula of its bordism class into a Kronecker product by E. Ossa. In this note we propose a verification formula by reconsidering it, through a little more ingenious in the use of this product formula, and try to apply it to the non-null bordantness results above.</description>

      <title>Splitting of homotopy idempotents revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are presenting proofs of fundamental results related to homotopy idempotents, proofs that are sufficiently simple so that even the author can understand them. The first one is that homotopy idempotents in the category of pointed connected CW complexes split and the second one is that unpointed homotopy idempotents in the category of finite-dimensional CW complexes split. Some of our proofs rectify gaps in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Topological lower bounds on the sizes of simplicial complexes and simplicial sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if an $n$-dimensional space $X$ satisfies certain topological conditions then any triangulation of $X$ as well as any its representation as a simplicial set with contractible faces has at least $2^n$ faces of dimension $n$.
  One example of such $X$ is the $n$-dimensional torus $(S^1)^n$.</description>

      <title>Invertible objects in Franke's comodule categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Picard group of Franke's category of quasi-periodic $E_0E$-comodules for $E$ a 2-periodic Landweber exact cohomology theory of height $n$ such as Morava $E$-theory, showing that for $2p-2 &gt; n^2+n$, this group is infinite cyclic, generated by the suspension of the unit. This is analogous to, but independent of, the corresponding calculations by Hovey and Sadofsky in the $E$-local stable homotopy category. We also give a computation of the Picard group of $I_n$-complete quasi-periodic $E_0E$-comodules when $E$ is Morava $E$-theory, as studied by Barthel--Schlank--Stapleton for $2p-2 \ge n^2$ and $p-1 \nmid n$, and compare this to the Picard group of the $K(n)$-local stable homotopy category, showing that they agree up to extension.</description>

      <title>Computability of digital cubical singular homology of $c_1$-digital images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital cubical singular homology $dH_q(X)$ for digital images $X$ was developed by the first and third authors, and digital analogues to various results in classical algebraic topology were proved. Another homology denoted $H_q^{c_1}(X)$ was developed by the second author for $c_1$-digital images, which is computationally much simpler than $dH_q(X)$. This paper shows the functoriality of $H_q^{c_1}$, as well as a chain map between $dH_q(X)$ and $H_q^{c_1}(X)$ when $X$ is a $c_1$-digital image.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology of partially ordered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore links between natural homology and persistent homology for the classification of directed spaces. The former is an algebraic invariant of directed spaces, a semantic model of concurrent programs. The latter was developed in the context of topological data analysis, in which topological properties of point-cloud data sets are extracted while eliminating noise. In both approaches, the evolution homological properties are tracked through a sequence of inclusions of usual topological spaces. Exploiting this similarity, we show that natural homology may be considered a persistence object, and may be calculated as a colimit of uni-dimensional persistent homologies along traces. Finally, we suggest further links and avenues of future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>A Thom Spectrum Model for $C_2$-Integral Brown--Gitler Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Thom spectrum model for a $C_2$-equivariant analogue of integral Brown--Gitler spectra is established and shown to have a multiplicative property. The $C_2$-equivariant spectra constructed enjoy properties analogous to classical nonequivariant integral Brown--Gitler spectra and thus may prove useful for producing $C_2$-equivariant analogues of splittings of $BP \langle 1 \rangle \wedge BP \langle 1 \rangle$ and $bo \wedge bo.$</description>

Abstract: In this note, we give a self-contained account on a construction for a directed homology theory based on modules over algebras, linking it to both persistence homology and natural homology. We study its first properties, among which some exact sequences.</description>

      <title>Higher Groups and Higher Normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue Prasma's homotopical group theory program by considering homotopy normal maps in arbitrary $\infty$-topoi. We show that maps of group objects equipped with normality data, in Prasma's sense, are algebras for a "normal closure" monad in a way which generalizes the standard loops-suspension monad. We generalize a result of Prasma by showing that monoidal functors of $\infty$-topoi preserve normal maps or, equivalently, that monoidal functors of $\infty$-topoi preserve the property of "being a fiber" for morphisms between connected objects. We also formulate Noether's Isomorphism Theorems in this setting, prove the first of them, and provide counterexamples to the other two. Accomplishing these goals requires us to spend substantial time synthesizing existing work of Lurie so that we may rigorously talk about group objects in $\infty$-topoi in the "usual way." One nice result of this labor is the formulation and proof of an Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem for group actions in $\infty$-topoi.</description>
