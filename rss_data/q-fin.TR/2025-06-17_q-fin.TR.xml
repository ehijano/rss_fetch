      <title>A New Approach for the Continuous Time Kyle-Back Strategic Insider Equilibrium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a continuous time Kyle-Back model which is a game problem between an insider and a market marker. The existing literature typically focuses on the existence of equilibrium by using the PDE approach, which requires certain Markovian structure and the equilibrium is in the bridge form. We shall provide a new approach which is used widely for stochastic controls and stochastic differential games. We characterize all equilibria through a coupled system of forward backward SDEs, where the forward one is the conditional law of the inside information and the backward one is the insider's optimal value. In particular, when the time duration is small, we show that the FBSDE is wellposed and thus the game has a unique equilibrium. This is the first uniqueness result in the literature, without restricting the equilibria to certain special structure. Moreover, this unique equilibrium may not be Markovian, indicating that the PDE approach cannot work in this case. We next study the set value of the game, which roughly speaking is the set of insider's values over all equilibria and thus is by nature unique. We show that, although the bridge type of equilibria in the literature does not satisfy the required integrability for our equilibria, its truncation serves as a desired approximate equilibrium and its value belongs to our set value. Finally, we characterize our set value through a level set of certain standard HJB equation.</description>

      <title>LOB-Bench: Benchmarking Generative AI for Finance -- an Application to Limit Order Book Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While financial data presents one of the most challenging and interesting sequence modelling tasks due to high noise, heavy tails, and strategic interactions, progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of consensus on quantitative evaluation paradigms. To address this, we present LOB-Bench, a benchmark, implemented in python, designed to evaluate the quality and realism of generative message-by-order data for limit order books (LOB) in the LOBSTER format. Our framework measures distributional differences in conditional and unconditional statistics between generated and real LOB data, supporting flexible multivariate statistical evaluation. The benchmark also includes features commonly used LOB statistics such as spread, order book volumes, order imbalance, and message inter-arrival times, along with scores from a trained discriminator network. Lastly, LOB-Bench contains "market impact metrics", i.e. the cross-correlations and price response functions for specific events in the data. We benchmark generative autoregressive state-space models, a (C)GAN, as well as a parametric LOB model and find that the autoregressive GenAI approach beats traditional model classes.</description>
