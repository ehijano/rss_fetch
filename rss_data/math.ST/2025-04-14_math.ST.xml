      <title>High-dimensional Gaussian approximations for robust means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed much progress on Gaussian and bootstrap approximations to max-type statistics of sums of independent random vectors with dimension $d$ large relative to the sample size $n$. However, for any number of moments $m&gt;2$ that the summands may possess, there exist distributions such that these approximations break down if $d$ grows faster than $n^{\frac{m}{2}-1}$. In this paper, we establish Gaussian and bootstrap approximations to the distributions of winsorized and trimmed means. Our implementation of these is fully data-driven and does not depend on any unknown population quantities. As a consequence, the performance of the approximation guarantees ``adapts'' to $m$. Furthermore, the approximations allow $d$ to grow at an exponential rate in $n$ as long as $m&gt;2$ moments exist and remain valid under minimal assumptions on the covariance matrix of the summands. As an added benefit, the approximations remain valid under a small amount of adversarial contamination.</description>

      <title>Winsorized mean estimation with heavy tails and adversarial contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-sample upper bounds on the estimation error of a winsorized mean estimator of the population mean in the presence of heavy tails and adversarial contamination are established. In comparison to existing results, the winsorized mean estimator we study avoids a sample splitting device and winsorizes substantially fewer observations, which improves its applicability and practical performance.</description>

      <title>Statistically guided deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretically well-founded deep learning algorithm for nonparametric regression. It uses over-parametrized deep neural networks with logistic activation function, which are fitted to the given data via gradient descent. We propose a special topology of these networks, a special random initialization of the weights, and a data-dependent choice of the learning rate and the number of gradient descent steps. We prove a theoretical bound on the expected $L_2$ error of this estimate, and illustrate its finite sample size performance by applying it to simulated data. Our results show that a theoretical analysis of deep learning which takes into account simultaneously optimization, generalization and approximation can result in a new deep learning estimate which has an improved finite sample performance.</description>

      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of Sub-quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>

      <title>Deep Distributional Learning with Non-crossing Quantile Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a non-crossing quantile (NQ) network for conditional distribution learning. By leveraging non-negative activation functions, the NQ network ensures that the learned distributions remain monotonic, effectively addressing the issue of quantile crossing. Furthermore, the NQ network-based deep distributional learning framework is highly adaptable, applicable to a wide range of applications, from classical non-parametric quantile regression to more advanced tasks such as causal effect estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL). We also develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the deep NQ estimator and its application to distributional RL, providing an in-depth analysis that demonstrates its effectiveness across these domains. Our experimental results further highlight the robustness and versatility of the NQ network.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Marginal Sensitivity Model and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitivity analysis is important to assess the impact of unmeasured confounding in causal inference from observational studies. The marginal sensitivity model (MSM) provides a useful approach in quantifying the influence of unmeasured confounders on treatment assignment and leading to tractable sharp bounds of common causal parameters. In this paper, to tighten MSM sharp bounds, we propose the enhanced MSM (eMSM) by incorporating another sensitivity constraint that quantifies the influence of unmeasured confounders on outcomes. We derive sharp population bounds of expected potential outcomes under eMSM, which are always narrower than the MSM sharp bounds in a simple and interpretable way. We further discuss desirable specifications of sensitivity parameters related to the outcome sensitivity constraint, and obtain both doubly robust point estimation and confidence intervals for the eMSM population bounds. The effectiveness of eMSM is also demonstrated numerically through two real-data applications. Our development represents, for the first time, a satisfactory extension of MSM to exploit both treatment and outcome sensitivity constraints on unmeasured confounding.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Clustering and Signal Recovery under Block Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies computationally efficient methods and their minimax optimality for high-dimensional clustering and signal recovery under block signal structures. We propose two sets of methods, cross-block feature aggregation PCA (CFA-PCA) and moving average PCA (MA-PCA), designed for sparse and dense block signals, respectively. Both methods adaptively utilize block signal structures, applicable to non-Gaussian data with heterogeneous variances and non-diagonal covariance matrices. Specifically, the CFA method utilizes a block-wise U-statistic to aggregate and select block signals non-parametrically from data with unknown cluster labels. We show that the proposed methods are consistent for both clustering and signal recovery under mild conditions and weaker signal strengths than the existing methods without considering block structures of signals. Furthermore, we derive both statistical and computational minimax lower bounds (SMLB and CMLB) for high-dimensional clustering and signal recovery under block signals, where the CMLBs are restricted to algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. The minimax boundaries partition signals into regions of impossibility and possibility. No algorithm (or no polynomial time algorithm) can achieve consistent clustering or signal recovery if the signals fall into the statistical (or computational) region of impossibility. We show that the proposed CFA-PCA and MA-PCA methods can achieve the CMLBs for the sparse and dense block signal regimes, respectively, indicating the proposed methods are computationally minimax optimal. A tuning parameter selection method is proposed based on post-clustering signal recovery results. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. A case study on global temperature change demonstrates their utility in practice.</description>

      <title>Standardization of Weighted Ranking Correlation Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relevant problem in statistics is defining the correlation of two rankings of a list of items. Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are two well established correlation coefficients, characterized by a symmetric form that ensures zero expected value between two pairs of rankings randomly chosen with uniform probability. However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the original Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account the greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in many contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero expected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it undermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a standardization function $g(x)$ that maps a correlation ranking coefficient $\Gamma$ in a standard form $g(\Gamma)$ that has zero expected value, while maintaining the relevant statistical properties of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Measure Theory of Conditionally Independent Random Function Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next evaluation point $x_{n+1}$ of a random function $\mathbf f = (\mathbf f(x))_{x\in \mathbb X}$ (a.k.a. stochastic process or random field) is often chosen based on the filtration of previously seen evaluations $\mathcal F_n := \sigma(\mathbf f(x_0),\dots, \mathbf f(x_n))$. This turns $x_{n+1}$ into a random variable $X_{n+1}$ and thereby $\mathbf f(X_{n+1})$ into a complex measure theoretical object. In applications, like geostatistics or Bayesian optimization, the evaluation locations $X_n$ are often treated as deterministic during the calculation of the conditional distribution $\mathbb P(\mathbf f(X_{n+1}) \in A \mid \mathcal F_n)$. We provide a framework to prove that the results obtained by this treatment are typically correct. We also treat the more general case where $X_{n+1}$ is not 'previsible' but independent from $\mathbf f$ conditional on $\mathcal F_n$ and the case of noisy evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study adversarial online nonparametric regression with general convex losses and propose a parameter-free learning algorithm that achieves minimax optimal rates. Our approach leverages chaining trees to compete against H{\"o}lder functions and establishes optimal regret bounds. While competing with nonparametric function classes can be challenging, they often exhibit local patterns - such as local H{\"o}lder continuity - that online algorithms can exploit. Without prior knowledge, our method dynamically tracks and adapts to different H{\"o}lder profiles by pruning a core chaining tree structure, aligning itself with local smoothness variations. This leads to the first computationally efficient algorithm with locally adaptive optimal rates for online regression in an adversarial setting. Finally, we discuss how these notions could be extended to a boosting framework, offering promising directions for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate extreme value analysis quantifies the probability and magnitude of joint extreme events. River discharges from the upper Danube River basin provide a challenging dataset for such analysis because the data, which is measured on a spatial network, exhibits both asymptotic dependence and asymptotic independence. To account for both features, we extend the conditional multivariate extreme value model (CMEVM) with a new approach for the residual distribution. This allows sparse (graphical) dependence structures and fully parametric prediction. Our approach fills a current gap in statistical methodology by extending graphical extremes models to asymptotically independent random variables. Further, the model can be used to learn the graphical dependence structure when it is unknown a priori. To support inference in high dimensions, we propose a stepwise inference procedure that is computationally efficient and loses no information or predictive power. We show our method is flexible and accurately captures the extremal dependence for the upper Danube River basin discharges.</description>

      <title>A partial likelihood approach to tree-based density modeling and its application in Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11692v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-based priors for probability distributions are usually specified using a predetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of the sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the entire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand deeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling probability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive computational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in regions with little probability mass. Thus, existing models typically make a compromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most desirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and results in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that this compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning in Bayesian inference, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper expansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of the data. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the candidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. Our partial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based methods and, in particular, to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give examples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with existing priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard, full-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency from adopting the partial likelihood.</description>
