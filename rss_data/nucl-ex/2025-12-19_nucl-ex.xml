      <title>A pathway towards decentralized studies of radioactive post-lead elements and their applications in beyond standard model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules have proven to be sensitive tools for studying physics beyond the standard model, with heavy and deformed nuclei offering decisive sensitivity to parity- and time-reversal-violating effects. However, almost all elements beyond lead, occupying the 6p~to~5f atomic orbitals, lack stable isotopes, hence molecules containing them are referred to as radioactive molecules. Among those, radium monofluoride has seen particular interest, but to date, research on radioactive molecules has mainly been limited to large-scale nuclear facilities. Here, we present a scheme that allows efficient and fast harvest of radioactive ions (including short-lived Ra), and show ion gas-phase reaction studies of singly and doubly charged Ra, Po, and Pb ions with SF$_6$ gas inside an ion trap. Our results show that the chemical reaction rate of Ra$^+$ is in line with trends of other alkaline earth elements, further support by quantum chemical computations. The reaction Ra$^{2+}$ + SF$_6$ $\rightarrow$ RaF${^+}$ + SF$_5^{+}$ achieves an almost unity conversion efficiency, making it particularly suitable for the application for studies in physics beyond the standard model. The scheme enables future decentralized research avenues with short-lived radioactive molecules for fundamental physics research at laboratories without the need for local nuclear reactors or accelerators.</description>

      <title>Comparing invariant-mass spectroscopy of 8B with ab initio predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levels in 8B have been investigated experimentally using the invariant-mass technique and compared to ab initio calculations. Data sets obtained using E/A=69-MeV 9C and 13O beams on a Be target have been further analyzed to extend the level scheme of 8B for Ex&lt;10 MeV. New levels were observed in the 2p+6Li, p+3He+alpha, and the p+7Be+gamma exit channels. Momentum correlations between the decay fragments were also investigated in order to deduce the decay pathways and whether the decays are prompt or sequential. This nucleus and its mirror were also investigated in the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell model. Correspondence between the newly observed and predicted levels were made based on the level energy and the decay modes. For positive parity levels with J&lt;=3, all predicted levels can be connected to an experimental counter part (as least tentatively) for Ex&lt;8.4 MeV.</description>

      <title>Towards First Detection of the Solar MSW Transition With JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter-induced neutrino flavor mixing (the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, or MSW, effect) is a central prediction of the neutrino mixing framework, but it has not been conclusively observed. Direct observation of the energy-dependent MSW transition in the solar electron-neutrino survival probability would solve this, but backgrounds have been prohibitive. We show that our new technique for suppressing muon-induced spallation backgrounds will allow JUNO to measure the MSW transition at $&gt;$4$\sigma$ significance in 10 years. This would strongly support upcoming multi-\$1B next-generation long-baseline experiments and their goals in cementing the neutrino mixing framework.</description>

      <title>Weak Charge Form Factor Determination at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the weak charge form factor, $F_W(Q^2)$, of nuclei over a continuous range of momentum transfers, $0\lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 0.1$ GeV$^2$, is essential for mapping out the distribution of neutrons in nuclei. The neutron density distribution has significant implications for a broad range of areas, including studies of nuclear structure, neutron stars, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, our knowledge of $F_W(Q^2)$ comes primarily from fixed target experiments that measure the parity-violating longitudinal electron spin asymmetry in coherent elastic electron-ion scattering. Fixed target experiments, such as CREX and PREX-1,2, have provided high-precision weak charge form factor extractions for the $^{48}{\rm Ca}$ and $^{208}{\rm Pb}$ nuclei, respectively. However, a major limitation of fixed target experiments is that they each provide data only at a single value of $Q^2$. With the proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) on the horizon, we explore its potential to impact the determination of the weak charge form factor. While it cannot compete with the precision of fixed target experiments, it can provide data over a wide and continuous range of $Q^2$ values, and for a wide variety of nuclei. We show that for integrated luminosities of $\mathcal{L} &gt; $ 200/$A$ fb$^{-1}$, where $A$ denotes the nucleus atomic weight, the EIC can be complementary to fixed target experiments, and can significantly impact constraints from CREX and PREX-1,2 by lifting degeneracies in theoretical models of the neutron density distribution.</description>

      <title>Entangled two-proton emission from 16Ne and its sensitivity to diproton correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how the spin correlation, which reflects the quantum entanglement between two fermions, can serve as a probe of diproton correlation in the two-proton ($2p$) emission. We investigated the 16Ne nucleus using the time-dependent three-body (14O + 2p) model, and found that the $2p$-spin correlation exceeded the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory when the initial state had a spin-singlet diproton configuration. In contrast, for other configurations, it was remarkably reduced. This suggests that a strong initial diproton correlation is essential to generate a spin correlation nearly identical to that of a pure spin-singlet diproton. Such sensitivity indicates that $2p$-spin correlation can serve as a sensitive probe of diproton configurations, which could facilitate future studies on quantum entanglement and spin-dependent phenomena in atomic nuclei as well as in broader multi-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Light Yield Response of Gd-compatible Water-based Liquid Scintillator with the Brookhaven 1-ton testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) enables hybrid detection by combining scintillation and Cherenkov signals, providing superior event reconstruction capabilities compared to conventional neutrino detectors. We measured the light yield of Gd-compatible WbLS at varying concentrations from 0.35\% to 1\% by mass, using cosmic-ray muons in a 1-ton scale detector at BNL. The light yield is measured as (69.16 $\pm$ 6.92) ph / MeV at 0.35\% concentration, which increased to (87.32 $\pm$ 8.73) ph / MeV at 1\%. These results establish a quantitative basis for optimizing future WbLS-based detectors in neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Hadron Physics Opportunities at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This White Paper outlines a coordinated, decade-spanning programme of hadron and QCD studies anchored at the GSI/FAIR accelerator complex. Profiting from intense deuteron, proton and pion beams coupled with high-rate capable detectors and an international theory effort, the initiative addresses fundamental questions related to the strong interaction featuring confinement and dynamical mass generation. This includes our understanding of hadron-hadron interactions and the composition of hadrons through mapping the baryon and meson spectra, including exotic states, and quantifying hadron structure. This interdisciplinary research connects topics in the fields of nuclear, heavy-ion, and (nuclear) astro (particle) physics, linking, for example, terrestrial data to constraints on neutron star structure. A phased roadmap with SIS100 accelerator start-up and envisaged detector upgrades will yield precision cross sections, transition form factors, in-medium spectral functions, and validated theory inputs. Synergies with external programmes at international accelerator facilities worldwide are anticipated. The programme is expected to deliver decisive advances in our understanding of non-perturbative (strong) QCD and astrophysics, and high-rate detector and data-science technology.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Light-Quark Yukawa Flavor Structure via Dihadron Fragmentation at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly probing light-quark Yukawa couplings and their flavor structure remains a major challenge due to their smallness and overwhelming QCD backgrounds. In this Letter, we propose a theoretical framework to access these couplings at lepton colliders through transverse spin dependent azimuthal modulations in dihadron fragmentation. These modulations arise from the interference between Higgs mediated and Standard Model amplitudes in $e^-e^+\to q\bar{q}Z$, producing angular structures that are linearly sensitive to the Yukawa couplings $y_q$, in contrast to conventional observables that scale as $y_q^2$. By combining channels with an identified accompanying single hadron, $h^\prime=\pi^\pm,K^\pm$, and $p/\bar{p}$, this approach cleanly disentangles the up- and down-quark Yukawa contributions, yielding typical limits at the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ level and establishing fragmentation dynamics as a novel and complementary probe of the Higgs flavor structure.</description>

      <title>Applying Gaussian Mixture Models to Track Reconstruction in Inelastic Scattering Experiments with Active Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active targets such as ACTAR TPC are well suited for studying giant resonances in unstable nuclei via inelastic scattering in inverse kinematics. A key challenge in such measurements is the detection of low-energy ejectiles emitted at small angles relative to the beam direction. Accurate reconstruction of these tracks is essential for disentangling different resonance modes. Probabilistic models such as the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) are particularly effective in capturing the complex covariance structures characteristic of the beam-recoil interface in narrow-angle events. In this work, we present a track reconstruction approach based on the GMM, specifically designed for inelastic scattering experiments with active targets. Special emphasis is placed on the treatment of low-energy tracks. The proposed method is demonstrated on simulated data of the $^{58}\mathrm{Ni}(\alpha,\alpha')^{58}\mathrm{Ni}$ reaction at an incident energy of $E=49$~MeV/nucleon, generated under conditions representative of the experiment carried out at GANIL for the same reaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle study demonstrating the first capture and time-of-flight spectrometry of highly charged ions (HCIs) produced following antiproton annihilations in a Penning-Malmberg trap. A multi-step nested-trap technique was developed using the \aegis\ experiment to identify annihilation-linked captured ions. The trapping and spectrometry of helium and argon ions demonstrates the approach. This work establishes a foundation for the in-trap synthesis of radioactive HCIs and the study of cold nuclear annihilation fragments, with the long-term goal of enabling a sensitive tool for probing the outer nuclear periphery.</description>

Abstract: A novel point cloud diffusion model for relativistic heavy-ion collisions, capable of ultra-fast generation of complete, event-by-event collision output, is introduced. When trained on UrQMD cascade simulations, the model generates realistic collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species, as a list of particle momentum vectors along with their particle ID. From solving inverse problems to accelerating model calculations or detector simulations, the model can be a promising general purpose tool for heavy-ion collisions beneficial to both theoretical studies and experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra fast, event-by-event heavy-ion simulations for next generation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative framework that uses probabilistic diffusion models for ultra fast, event-by-event simulations of heavy-ion collision output. This new framework is trained on UrQMD cascade data to generate a full collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species. The output is represented as a point cloud, where each point is defined by a particle's momentum vector and its corresponding species information (ID). Our architecture integrates a normalizing flow-based condition generator that encodes global event features into a latent vector, and a diffusion model that synthesizes a point cloud of particles based on this condition. A detailed description of the model and an in-depth analysis of its performance is provided. The conditional point cloud diffusion model learns to generate realistic output particles of collision events which successfully reproduce the UrQMD distributions for multiplicity, momentum and rapidity of each hadron type. The flexible point cloud representation of the event output preserves full event-level granularity, enabling direct application to inverse problems and parameter estimation tasks while also making it easily adaptable for accelerating any event-by-event model calculation or detector simulation.</description>
