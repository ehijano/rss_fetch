      <title>Implementing Decentralized Per-Partition Automatic Failover in Azure Cosmos DB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azure Cosmos DB is a cloud-native distributed database, operating at a massive scale, powering Microsoft Cloud. Think 10s of millions of database partitions (replica-sets), 100+ PBs of data under management, 20M+ vCores. Failovers are an integral part of distributed databases to provide data availability during outages (partial or full regional outages). While failovers within a replica-set within a single region are well understood and commonly exercised, geo failovers in databases across regions are not as common and usually left as a disaster recovery scenario. An upcoming release of Azure Cosmos DB introduces a fine grained (partition-level) automatic failover solution for geo failovers that minimizes the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and honors customer-chosen consistency level and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) at any scale. This is achieved thanks to a decentralized architecture which offers seamless horizontal scaling to allow us to handle outages ranging from node-level faults to full-scale regional outages. Our solution is designed to handle a broad spectrum of hardware and software faults, including node failures, crashes, power events and most network partitions, that span beyond the scope of a single fault domain or an availability zone.</description>

      <title>MoTime: A Dataset Suite for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.</description>

      <title>Maximum Degree-Based Quasi-Clique Search via an Iterative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cohesive subgraph mining is a fundamental problem in graph theory with numerous real-world applications, such as social network analysis and protein-protein interaction modeling. Among various cohesive subgraphs, the $\gamma$-quasi-clique is widely studied for its flexibility in requiring each vertex to connect to at least a $\gamma$ proportion of other vertices in the subgraph. However, solving the maximum $\gamma$-quasi-clique problem is NP-hard and further complicated by the lack of the hereditary property, which makes designing efficient pruning strategies challenging. Existing algorithms, such as DDA and FastQC, either struggle with scalability or exhibit significant performance declines for small values of $\gamma$. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, IterQC, which reformulates the maximum $\gamma$-quasi-clique problem as a series of $k$-plex problems that possess the hereditary property. IterQC introduces a non-trivial iterative framework and incorporates two key optimization techniques: (1) the pseudo lower bound (pseudo LB) technique, which leverages information across iterations to improve the efficiency of branch-and-bound searches, and (2) the preprocessing technique that reduces problem size and unnecessary iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterQC achieves up to four orders of magnitude speedup and solves significantly more graph instances compared to state-of-the-art algorithms DDA and FastQC.</description>

      <title>Enabling the Reuse of Personal Data in Research: A Classification Model for Legal Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a proposal made almost ten years ago, this paper presents a model for classifying per-sonal data for research to inform researchers on how to manage them. The classification is based on the principles of the European General Data Protection Regulation and its implementation under the Spanish Law. The paper also describes in which conditions personal data may be stored and can be accessed ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and safeguarding privacy. The work has been developed collaboratively by the Library and the Data Protection Office. The outcomes of this collaboration are a decision tree for researchers and a list of requirements for research data re-positories to store and grant access to personal data securely. This proposal is aligned with the FAIR principles and the commitment for responsible open science practices.</description>

      <title>Robo-DM: Data Management For Large Robot Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results suggest that very large datasets of teleoperated robot demonstrations can be used to train transformer-based models that have the potential to generalize to new scenes, robots, and tasks. However, curating, distributing, and loading large datasets of robot trajectories, which typically consist of video, textual, and numerical modalities - including streams from multiple cameras - remains challenging. We propose Robo-DM, an efficient open-source cloud-based data management toolkit for collecting, sharing, and learning with robot data. With Robo-DM, robot datasets are stored in a self-contained format with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML). Robo-DM can significantly reduce the size of robot trajectory data, transfer costs, and data load time during training. Compared to the RLDS format used in OXE datasets, Robo-DM's compression saves space by up to 70x (lossy) and 3.5x (lossless). Robo-DM also accelerates data retrieval by load-balancing video decoding with memory-mapped decoding caches. Compared to LeRobot, a framework that also uses lossy video compression, Robo-DM is up to 50x faster when decoding sequentially. We physically evaluate a model trained by Robo-DM with lossy compression, a pick-and-place task, and In-Context Robot Transformer. Robo-DM uses 75x compression of the original dataset and does not suffer reduction in downstream task accuracy.</description>

      <title>Distance Adaptive Beam Search for Provably Accurate Graph-Based Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearest neighbor search is central in machine learning, information retrieval, and databases. For high-dimensional datasets, graph-based methods such as HNSW, DiskANN, and NSG have become popular thanks to their empirical accuracy and efficiency. These methods construct a directed graph over the dataset and perform beam search on the graph to find nodes close to a given query. While significant work has focused on practical refinements and theoretical understanding of graph-based methods, many questions remain. We propose a new distance-based termination condition for beam search to replace the commonly used condition based on beam width. We prove that, as long as the search graph is navigable, our resulting Adaptive Beam Search method is guaranteed to approximately solve the nearest-neighbor problem, establishing a connection between navigability and the performance of graph-based search. We also provide extensive experiments on our new termination condition for both navigable graphs and approximately navigable graphs used in practice, such as HNSW and Vamana graphs. We find that Adaptive Beam Search outperforms standard beam search over a range of recall values, data sets, graph constructions, and target number of nearest neighbors. It thus provides a simple and practical way to improve the performance of popular methods.</description>

      <title>SQL-o1: A Self-Reward Heuristic Dynamic Search Method for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) aims to map natural language questions to executable SQL queries. Although large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress, current approaches struggle with poor transferability to open-source LLMs, limited robustness against logic and function errors in complex queries, and inefficiencies in structured search. We introduce SQL-o1, a self-reward-driven heuristic search framework built on an agent-based architecture to enhance model reasoning capabilities. SQL-o1 leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for structured, multi-step exploration, and incorporates a dynamic pruning strategy to accelerate inference without sacrificing accuracy. On the Spider and Bird benchmarks, SQL-o1 achieves a +10.8 execution accuracy improvement on the complex Bird dataset, surpassing even GPT-4-based models. Notably, it exhibits strong few-shot generalization and robust cross-model transferability across open-source LLMs. Our code is available at:https://github.com/ShuaiLyu0110/SQL-o1.</description>
