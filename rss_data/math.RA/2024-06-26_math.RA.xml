      <title>Rosenbrock's Theorem on System Matrices over Elementary Divisor Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rosenbrock's theorem on polynomial system matrices is a classical result in linear systems theory that relates the Smith-McMillan form of a rational matrix $G$ with the Smith forms of an irreducible polynomial system matrix $P$ giving rise to $G$ and of a submatrix of $P$. This theorem has been essential in the development of algorithms for computing the poles and zeros of a rational matrix via linearizations and generalized eigenvalue algorithms. In this paper, we extend Rosenbrock's theorem to system matrices $P$ with entries in an arbitrary elementary divisor domain $\mathfrak R$ and matrices $G$ with entries in the field of fractions of $\mathfrak R$. These are the most general rings where the involved Smith-McMillan and Smith forms both exist and, so, where the problem makes sense. Moreover, we analyze in detail what happens when the system matrix is not irreducible. Finally, we explore how Rosenbrock's theorem can be extended when the system matrix $P$ itself has entries in the field of fractions of the elementary divisor domain.</description>

      <title>Polyadic supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a polyadic analog of supersymmetry by considering the polyadization procedure (proposed by the author) applied to the toy model of one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The supercharges are generalized to polyadic ones using the $n$-ary sigma matrices defined in earlier work. In this way, polyadic analogs of supercharges and Hamiltonians take the cyclic shift block matrix form, and they can describe multidegenerated quantum states in a way that is different from the $N$-extended and multigraded SQM. While constructing the corresponding supersymmetry as an $n$-ary Lie superalgebra ($n$ is the arity of the initial associative multiplication), we have found new brackets with a reduced arity of $2\leq m&lt;n$ and a related series of $m$-ary superalgebras (which is impossible for binary superalgebras). In the case of even reduced arity $m$ we obtain a tower of higher order (as differential operators) even Hamiltonians, while for $m$ odd we get a tower of higher order odd supercharges, and the corresponding algebra consists of the odd sector only.</description>

      <title>Lifting of locally initial objects and universal (co)acting Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universal (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras introduced by Yu.\,I.~Manin, M.~Sweedler and D.~Tambara, the universal Hopf algebra of a given (co)module structure, as well as the universal group of a grading, introduced by J.~Patera and H.~Zassenhaus, find their applications in the classification of quantum symmetries. Typically, universal (co)acting objects are defined as initial or terminal in the corresponding categories and, as such, they do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, we introduce the support of a given object, which generalizes the support of a grading and is used to restrict the class of objects under consideration. The existence problems for universal objects are formulated and studied in a purely categorical manner by seeing them as particular cases of the lifting problem for a locally initial object. We prove the existence of a lifting and, consequently, of the universal (co)acting objects under some assumptions on the base (braided or symmetric monoidal) category. In contrast to existing constructions, our approach is self-dual in the sense that we can use the same proof to obtain the existence of universal actions and coactions. In particular, when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field, the category of sets or their duals, we recover known existence results for the aforementioned universal objects. The proposed approach allows us to apply our results not only to the classical categories of sets and vectors spaces and their duals but also to (co)modules over bi/Hopf algebras, differential graded vector spaces, $G$-sets and graded sets.</description>

      <title>Dualities for universal (co)acting Hopf monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general, universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids, which prove to be a useful tool in the classification of quantum symmetries, do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, the support of a given object was recently introduced in \cite{AGV3} and used to restrict the class of objects considered when defining universal (co)acting objects. It is well-known that, in contrast with the universal coacting Hopf algebra, for actions on algebras over a field it is usually difficult to describe the universal acting Hopf algebra explicitly and this turns the duality theorem into an important investigation tool. In the present paper we establish duality results for universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids in pre-rigid braided monoidal categories $\mathcal C$. In addition, when the base category $\mathcal C$ is closed monoidal, we provide a convenient uniform approach to the aforementioned universal objects in terms of the cosupports, which in this case become subobjects of internal hom-objects. In order to explain our constructions, we use the language of locally initial objects. Known results from the literature are recovered when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field. New cases where our results can be applied are explored, including categories of (co)modules over (co)quasitriangular Hopf algebras, Yetter-Drinfeld modules and dg-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>The Hopf category of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal measuring coalgebras between Frobenius algebras turn the category of Frobenius algebras into a Hopf category (in the sense of \cite{BCV}), and the universal comeasuring algebras between Frobenius algebras turn the category Frobenius algebras into a Hopf opcategory. We also discuss duality and compatibility results between these structures.
  Our theory vastly generalizes the well-known fact that any homomorphism beween Frobenius algebras is an isomorphism, but also allows to go beyond classical (iso)morphisms between Frobenius algebras, especially in finite characteristic, as we show by some explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a noetherian criterion for a sequence of modules equipped with linear maps between them. This generalizes a noetherian criterion of Gan and Li for infinite EI categories. We apply our criterion to the linear categories associated to certain diagram algebras defined by Patzt.</description>

      <title>Graded $p$-polar rings and the homology of $\Omega^n\Sigma^nX$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an extension of previous ungraded work, we define a graded $p$-polar ring to be an analog of a graded commutative ring where multiplication is only allowed on $p$-tuples (instead of pairs) of elements of equal degree. We show that the free affine $p$-adic group scheme functor, as well as the free formal group functor, defined on $k$-algebras for a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$, factors through $p$-polar $k$-algebras. It follows that the same is true for any affine $p$-adic or formal group functor, in particular for the functor of $p$-typical Witt vectors. As an application, we show that the homology of the free $E_n$-algebra $H^*(\Omega^n\Sigma^n X;\mathbf F_p)$, as a Hopf algebra, only depends on the $p$-polar structure of $H^*(X;\mathbf F_p)$ in a functorial way.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras and Hopf braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship of Rota-Baxter operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras with Hopf braces and the Yang-Baxter equation, with emphasis on the embedding of cocommutative Hopf braces into Rota-Baxter Hopf algebras. Through Hopf braces, we establish a connection between relative Rota-Baxter operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras and bijective 1-cocycles. Finally, we introduce the notion of symmetric Hopf braces, and establish the relationship between symmetric Hopf braces and Rota-Baxter Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalization the parameters of minimal linear codes over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{{p_1}{p_2}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, We introduce a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a linear code to achieve minimality when analyzed over the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.The fundamental inquiry in minimal linear codes is the existence of a $[m,k]$ minimal linear code where $k$ is less than or equal to $m$. W. Lu et al. ( see \cite{nine}) showed that there exists a positive integer $m(k;q)$ such that for $m\geq m(k;q)$ a minimal linear code of length $m$ and dimension $k$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ must exist. They give the upper and lower bound of $m(k;q)$. In this manuscript, we establish both an upper and lower bound for $m(k;p^l)$ and $m(k;p_1p_2)$ within the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1p_2}$ respectively.</description>
