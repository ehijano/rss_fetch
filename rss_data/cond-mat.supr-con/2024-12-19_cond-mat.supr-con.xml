      <title>Comments on "Fundamental nature of the self-field critical current in superconductors", arxiv:2409.16758</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide comments on article "Fundamental nature of the self-field critical current in superconductors" by Talantsev and Tallon, arXiv:2409.16758 and https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4978589 related to the predictions of the key equation proposed in article "Universal self-field critical current for thin-film superconductors," by Talantsev and Tallon, Nat. Commun. 6 (2015) 7820. We respond to claims and assertions made in these articles and also show that the so-called "Universal self-field critical current" and the "fundamental limit" for self-field Jc suggested by Talantsev and Tallon, has been proven incorrect experimentally and this invalidates the key claims and findings stated in both these articles.</description>

      <title>High-throughput discovery of robust room-temperature superconductors among complex ternary clathrate hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the decade-long exhaustive study of binary high-Tc superconducting hydrides, the frontier of this stimulating research field has recently shifted to ternary hydrides with much expanded conformational space in search of coveted room-temperature superconductors. This task, however, presents a formidable challenge due to enormous demands on computational resources. Here, we devise an efficient high-throughput approach using keen material insights and a self-built database to screen for robust ternary hydrides in clathrate structures, which were proven to host highest Tc in binary hydrides, and to estimate Tc by a reliable empirical formula. This approach has made it possible to uncover a diverse set of complex multiple-hydrogen-cage ternary hydrides hosting near or above room-temperature Tc, which are beyond the reach of prevailing structure search methods. This study establishes a distinct paradigm that opens a fresh avenue to enable and accelerate the discovery of promising room-temperature superconductors among unprecedented complex clathrate hydrides.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of two-dimensional hydrogenated transition-metal diborides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of MgB2 with Tc=39K, various metal diborides of MB2 have been intensively studied to find possible conventional high-temperature superconductors. A possible 2D structure of the metal diboride has been shown to be in the form of M2B2. Using density functional theory, we investigated phase stability and possible conventional superconductors for non-hydrogenation M2B2, light hydrogenation M2B2H, and heavy hydrogenation M2B2H4 of transition metal borides M2B2 (M=Sc,Y,V,Nb). The light hydrogenation M2B2H show as if they were a perturbed system from the non-hydrogenation in which the electronic structure, the phonon property, and the possible superconducting state are slightly changed. However, the heavy hydrogenation of M2B2H4 give very promising 2D materials with a possible high Tc of up to 84K at ambient pressure. This would fill the gaps for the study of possible conventional high-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations in the parent phase of Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$ODFeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating spin correlations in the parent compounds of high-temperature superconductors is crucial for understanding superconductivity. We used neutron scattering to study spin correlations in Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$ODFeSe, an insulating material with reduced electron carriers compared to its superconducting counterpart ($T_c$ = 41 K), serving as the undoped parent compound. Our findings show a reduced total fluctuating moment in this insulator relative to FeSe and 122 iron pnictides, likely due to increased interlayer distances from intercalation, which enhance fluctuations and reduce the intensity of spin excitations. Moreover, we observed a V-shaped spin wave-like excitation dispersion, contrasting with the twisted hourglass pattern in the superconducting counterpart. Electron doping shifts spin excitation from ($\pi$, 0) point to an incommensurate position towards ($\pi$, $\pi$) direction below 65 meV. This transition from V-shaped to hourglass-like dispersion, akin to behaviors in hole-doped cuprates, suggests a potential shared mechanism in magnetism and superconductivity across these diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Selective excitation of collective modes in multiband superconductor MgB2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in nonequilibrium and nonlinear terahertz (THz) spectroscopies have significantly advanced our understanding of collective excitations in superconductors. However, there is still debate surrounding the identification of Higgs or Leggett modes, as well as BCS charge fluctuations, in the well-known two-band superconductor MgB$_2$. Here, we utilized both multi-cycle and single-cycle THz pump-broadband THz probe techniques to investigate the THz nonlinear response of MgB$_2$. Through multicycle THz pump-THz probe experiments on MgB$_2$, we observed distinct nonlinear signals at both the fundamental frequency ($\omega$) and the second harmonic frequency (2$\omega$) of the pump pulses, which exhibited resonant enhancement at temperatures where their frequencies respectively match 2$\Delta_{\pi}(T)$. They are mainly attributed to the $\pi$-band Higgs mode. By adjusting the THz pump pulse to a single-cycle waveform that satisfies non-adiabatic excitation criteria, we observed an over-damped oscillation corresponding to the Leggett mode. Our findings contribute to solving the ongoing debates and demonstrate the selective excitation of collective modes in multiband superconductors, offering new insights into the interaction between Higgs and Leggett modes.</description>

      <title>Universal nonanalytic features in response functions of anisotropic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonanalytic features are interesting in physics as they carry valuable information about the physical properties of the system. These properties manifest themselves in observables containing a one- or two-particle spectral function. In this work, we use a stationary-point analysis to deduce the nonanalytic features of spectral functions that appear while computing dynamical correlation functions. We focus on the correlation functions relevant to inelastic light scattering from anisotropic superconductors and show that nodal regions of the order parameters are, quite generally, associated with linear-in-frequency scaling at low frequencies, the minima points of the order parameters are associated with step jumps, while the maxima points are associated with $\ln$ singularities. Despite this general association, we show that depending on the anisotropy of the light-scattering vertex, these features can manifest themselves as various power laws, and even not remain singular at all. We demonstrate the conditions under which these happen. We are also able to demonstrate that the association of these nonanalytic features with the extrema and nodal points of the order parameter is, in fact, derived from a more universal behaviour of functions near parabolic-like and saddle-like stationary points. We provide a general prescription that maps the universal behaviour of systems near such stationary points to different scenarios. The approach is readily extendable to other types of spectral functions and we exemplify it by also analyzing the density of states on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Underscreened Kondo Compensation in a Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic impurity with a larger $S=1$ spin remains partially screened by the Kondo effect when embedded in a metal. However, when placed within an $s$-wave superconductor, the interplay between the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$ and the Kondo temperature $T_K$ induces a quantum phase transition from an underscreened doublet Kondo to an unscreened triplet phase, typically occurring when $\Delta/T_K\approx 1$. We investigate the Kondo compensation of the impurity spin resulting from this partial screening across the quantum phase transition, which together with the spin-spin correlation function serves as a measure of the Kondo cloud's integrity. Deep within the unscreened triplet phase, $\Delta/T_K\gg 1$, the compensation vanishes, signifying complete decoupling of the impurity spin from the environment, while in the partially screened doublet phase, $\Delta/T_K\ll 1$, it asymptotically approaches $1/2$, indicating that half of the spin is screened. Notably, there is a universal jump in the compensation precisely at the phase transition, which we accurately calculate. The spin-spin correlation function exhibits an oscillatory pattern with an envelope function decaying as $\sim 1/x$ at short distances. At larger distances, the superconducting gap induces an exponentially decaying behavior $\sim \exp(-x/\xi_\Delta)$ governed by the superconducting correlation length $\xi_\Delta$, irrespective of the phase, without any distinctive features across the transition. Furthermore, the spectral functions of some relevant operators are evaluated and discussed. In terms of the methods used, a consistent description is provided through the application of multiplicative, numerical and density matrix renormalization group techniques.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and unconventional superconductivity in a simple model of metal-organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting metal-organic framework Cu-BHT forms a kagome lattice with metals at the vertices and ligands along the bonds. This bipartite motif is common in reticular materials. We show that a tight-binding model on this lattice yields partially occupied interference-induced flat bands at half-filling with large gaps between them and all other bands. Long-range hopping induces curvature in the bands but leaves them flatter and more isolated than those in twisted bilayer graphene. The slave boson theory of the t-J model on this lattice shows highly unconventional superconductivity including an f -wave singlet phase. Thus, framework materials provide an ideal lattice-driven approach to strongly correlated phenomena in flat bands at high electronic densities.</description>

      <title>Magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures: dependence on the number of superconducting monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructures with a large number of atomic layers leads to a suppression of the superconducting order parameter and appearance of Zeeman-like spin splitting of the local density of states (LDOS). Here we study the magnetic proximity effects in van der Waals S/F heterostructures with a few atomic layers and demonstrate that the corresponding physics is very different from the classical results. We find that the dependence of the superconducting order parameter exhibits dips as a function of the ferromagnetic exchange field and gating. The number of dips is determined by the number of monolayers in the heterostructure and, in general, the superconductivity is not suppressed by large values of the exchange field. The spin splitting of the LDOS cannot be described by an effective Zeeman field and manifests a multiple peak structure, where each peak is connected to a unique spin splitting of one of the superconducting bands, which also can be tuned by gating.</description>

      <title>Low loss hybrid Nb/Au superconducting resonators for quantum circuit applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators play a crucial role in the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a 100 nm niobium (Nb) circuit with a 10 nm gold (Au) capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies.</description>
