      <title>The CASTLE 2024 Dataset: Advancing the Art of Multimodal Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Egocentric video has seen increased interest in recent years, as it is used in a range of areas. However, most existing datasets are limited to a single perspective. In this paper, we present the CASTLE 2024 dataset, a multimodal collection containing ego- and exo-centric (i.e., first- and third-person perspective) video and audio from 15 time-aligned sources, as well as other sensor streams and auxiliary data. The dataset was recorded by volunteer participants over four days in a fixed location and includes the point of view of 10 participants, with an additional 5 fixed cameras providing an exocentric perspective. The entire dataset contains over 600 hours of UHD video recorded at 50 frames per second. In contrast to other datasets, CASTLE 2024 does not contain any partial censoring, such as blurred faces or distorted audio. The dataset is available via https://castle-dataset.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Align Your Rhythm: Generating Highly Aligned Dance Poses with Gating-Enhanced Rhythm-Aware Feature Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically generating natural, diverse and rhythmic human dance movements driven by music is vital for virtual reality and film industries. However, generating dance that naturally follows music remains a challenge, as existing methods lack proper beat alignment and exhibit unnatural motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Danceba, a novel framework that leverages gating mechanism to enhance rhythm-aware feature representation for music-driven dance generation, which achieves highly aligned dance poses with enhanced rhythmic sensitivity. Specifically, we introduce Phase-Based Rhythm Extraction (PRE) to precisely extract rhythmic information from musical phase data, capitalizing on the intrinsic periodicity and temporal structures of music. Additionally, we propose Temporal-Gated Causal Attention (TGCA) to focus on global rhythmic features, ensuring that dance movements closely follow the musical rhythm. We also introduce Parallel Mamba Motion Modeling (PMMM) architecture to separately model upper and lower body motions along with musical features, thereby improving the naturalness and diversity of generated dance movements. Extensive experiments confirm that Danceba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significantly better rhythmic alignment and motion diversity.

      <title>CLIP-PING: Boosting Lightweight Vision-Language Models with Proximus Intrinsic Neighbors Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03871v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond the success of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), recent trends mark a shift toward exploring the applicability of lightweight vision-language models for resource-constrained scenarios. These models often deliver suboptimal performance when relying solely on a single image-text contrastive learning objective, spotlighting the need for more effective training mechanisms that guarantee robust cross-modal feature alignment. In this work, we propose CLIP-PING: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training with Proximus Intrinsic Neighbors Guidance, a novel yet simple and efficient training paradigm designed to boost the performance of lightweight vision-language models with minimal computational overhead and lower data demands. CLIP-PING bootstraps unimodal features extracted from arbitrary pre-trained encoders to obtain intrinsic guidance of proximus neighbor samples, i.e., nearest-neighbor (NN) and cross nearest-neighbor (XNN). We find that extra contrastive supervision from these neighbors substantially boosts cross-modal alignment, enabling lightweight models to learn more generic features with rich semantic diversity. Extensive experiments reveal that CLIP-PING notably surpasses its peers in zero-shot generalization and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Specifically, a 5.5% gain on zero-shot ImageNet1K classification with 10.7% (I2T) and 5.7% (T2I) on Flickr30K retrieval, compared to the original CLIP when using ViT-XS image encoder trained on 3 million (image, text) pairs. Moreover, CLIP-PING showcases a strong transferability under the linear evaluation protocol across several downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>DreamLLM-3D: Affective Dream Reliving using Large Language Model and 3D Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DreamLLM-3D, a composite multimodal AI system behind an immersive art installation for dream re-experiencing. It enables automated dream content analysis for immersive dream-reliving, by integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with text-to-3D Generative AI. The LLM processes voiced dream reports to identify key dream entities (characters and objects), social interaction, and dream sentiment. The extracted entities are visualized as dynamic 3D point clouds, with emotional data influencing the color and soundscapes of the virtual dream environment. Additionally, we propose an experiential AI-Dreamworker Hybrid paradigm. Our system and paradigm could potentially facilitate a more emotionally engaging dream-reliving experience, enhancing personal insights and creativity.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Semantic-Driven Adaptive Gaussian Splatting in Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly improved the efficiency and realism of three-dimensional scene visualization in several applications, ranging from robotics to eXtended Reality (XR). This work presents SAGE (Semantic-Driven Adaptive Gaussian Splatting in Extended Reality), a novel framework designed to enhance the user experience by dynamically adapting the Level of Detail (LOD) of different 3DGS objects identified via a semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate how SAGE effectively reduces memory and computational overhead while keeping a desired target visual quality, thus providing a powerful optimization for interactive XR applications.</description>

      <title>OmniFlow: Any-to-Any Generation with Multi-Modal Rectified Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce OmniFlow, a novel generative model designed for any-to-any generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-audio, and audio-to-image synthesis. OmniFlow advances the rectified flow (RF) framework used in text-to-image models to handle the joint distribution of multiple modalities. It outperforms previous any-to-any models on a wide range of tasks, such as text-to-image and text-to-audio synthesis. Our work offers three key contributions: First, we extend RF to a multi-modal setting and introduce a novel guidance mechanism, enabling users to flexibly control the alignment between different modalities in the generated outputs. Second, we propose a novel architecture that extends the text-to-image MMDiT architecture of Stable Diffusion 3 and enables audio and text generation. The extended modules can be efficiently pretrained individually and merged with the vanilla text-to-image MMDiT for fine-tuning. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive study on the design choices of rectified flow transformers for large-scale audio and text generation, providing valuable insights into optimizing performance across diverse modalities. The Code will be available at https://github.com/jacklishufan/OmniFlows.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Single Image Dehazing Algorithm by Cross-Data Vision Alignment for Richer Representation Learning and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks tasks have increasingly relied on high-quality image inputs. With the development of high-resolution representation learning, the task of image dehazing has received significant attention. Previously, many methods collect diverse image data for large-scale training to boost the performance on a target scene. Ignoring the domain gap between different data, former de-hazing methods simply adopt multiple datasets for explicit large-scale training, which often makes the methods themselves be violated. To address this problem, we propose a novel method of cross-data vision alignment for richer representation learning to improve the existing dehazing methodology. Specifically, we call for the internal- and external knowledge should be further adapted with a self-supervised manner to fill up the domain gap. By using cross-data external alignment, the datasets inherit samples from different domains that are firmly aligned, making the model learn more robust and generalizable features. By using the internal augmentation method, the model can fully exploit local information within the images, and then obtaining more image details. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct training on the Natural Image Dataset (NID). Experimental results show that our method clearly resolves the domain gap in different dehazing datasets and presents a new pipeline for large-scale training in the dehazing task. Our approach significantly outperforms other advanced methods in dehazing and produces dehazed images that are closest to real haze-free images.</description>

      <title>GiVE: Guiding Visual Encoder to Perceive Overlooked Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have advanced AI in applications like text-to-video generation and visual question answering. These models rely on visual encoders to convert non-text data into vectors, but current encoders either lack semantic alignment or overlook non-salient objects. We propose the Guiding Visual Encoder to Perceive Overlooked Information (GiVE) approach. GiVE enhances visual representation with an Attention-Guided Adapter (AG-Adapter) module and an Object-focused Visual Semantic Learning module. These incorporate three novel loss terms: Object-focused Image-Text Contrast (OITC) loss, Object-focused Image-Image Contrast (OIIC) loss, and Object-focused Image Discrimination (OID) loss, improving object consideration, retrieval accuracy, and comprehensiveness. Our contributions include dynamic visual focus adjustment, novel loss functions to enhance object retrieval, and the Multi-Object Instruction (MOInst) dataset. Experiments show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>EgoTextVQA: Towards Egocentric Scene-Text Aware Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce EgoTextVQA, a novel and rigorously constructed benchmark for egocentric QA assistance involving scene text. EgoTextVQA contains 1.5K ego-view videos and 7K scene-text aware questions that reflect real user needs in outdoor driving and indoor house-keeping activities. The questions are designed to elicit identification and reasoning on scene text in an egocentric and dynamic environment. With EgoTextVQA, we comprehensively evaluate 10 prominent multimodal large language models. Currently, all models struggle, and the best results (Gemini 1.5 Pro) are around 33\% accuracy, highlighting the severe deficiency of these techniques in egocentric QA assistance. Our further investigations suggest that precise temporal grounding and multi-frame reasoning, along with high resolution and auxiliary scene-text inputs, are key for better performance. With thorough analyses and heuristic suggestions, we hope EgoTextVQA can serve as a solid testbed for research in egocentric scene-text QA assistance. Our dataset is released at: https://github.com/zhousheng97/EgoTextVQA.</description>

      <title>Kiss3DGen: Repurposing Image Diffusion Models for 3D Asset Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved great success in generating 2D images. However, the quality and generalizability of 3D content generation remain limited. State-of-the-art methods often require large-scale 3D assets for training, which are challenging to collect. In this work, we introduce Kiss3DGen (Keep It Simple and Straightforward in 3D Generation), an efficient framework for generating, editing, and enhancing 3D objects by repurposing a well-trained 2D image diffusion model for 3D generation. Specifically, we fine-tune a diffusion model to generate ''3D Bundle Image'', a tiled representation composed of multi-view images and their corresponding normal maps. The normal maps are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh, and the multi-view images provide texture mapping, resulting in a complete 3D model. This simple method effectively transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task, maximizing the utilization of knowledge in pretrained diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Kiss3DGen model is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as 3D editing, mesh and texture enhancement, etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce high-quality 3D models efficiently.</description>
