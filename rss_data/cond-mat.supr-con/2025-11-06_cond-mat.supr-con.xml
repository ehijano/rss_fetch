      <title>Niobium's intrinsic coherence length and penetration depth revisited using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits. Depth-resolved low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) was used to quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm, corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ value are smaller than values commonly used in applications and modeling, indicating that clean niobium lies at the boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.</description>

      <title>The theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions with equal Fermi velocities and effective masses in all layers. The theory takes into account phase gradients in superconducting layers commonly ignored in the past. At $T=0$ the current-phase relation was derived for any thickness $L$ of the normal layer in the model of the steplike pairing potential model analytically. The obtained current-phase relation is essentially different from that in theory neglecting phase gradients, especially in the limit $L\to 0$ (short junction). The analysis resolves the problem with the charge conservation law in the steplike pairing potential model. The current-phase relation at temperatures exceeding the energy spacing between Andreev levels but less than the critical temperature was also calculated numerically. The current at these temperatures is temperature independent and decreases with growing $L$ as $1/L^4$. The previous theory predicted the current exponentially decreasing with growing $T$ and $L$. Possible implications of the analysis for planar junctions with non-equal Fermi velocities and for non-planar junctions (narrow normal bridge between two bulk superconductors) are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Analog-to-Digital Converter Based on Voltage-controlled Superconducting Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for cryogenic electronics in superconducting and quantum computing systems calls for ultra energy efficient data conversion architectures that remain functional at deep cryogenic temperatures.In this work, we present the first design of a voltage-controlled superconducting flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on a novel quantum enhanced Josephson junction field effect transistor (JJFET).Exploiting its strong gate tunability and transistor-like behavior, the JJFET offers a scalable alternative to conventional current controlled superconducting devices while aligning naturally with CMOS style design methodologies.Building on our previously developed Verilog A compact model calibrated to experimental data, we design and simulate a three bit JJFET based flash ADC.The core comparator block is realized through careful bias current selection and augmented with a three terminal nanocryotron to precisely define reference voltages.Cascaded JJFET comparators ensure robust voltage gain, cascadability, and logic level restoration across stages.Simulation results demonstrate accurate quantization behavior with ultra-low power dissipation, underscoring the feasibility of voltage driven superconducting mixed signal circuits.This work establishes a critical step toward unifying superconducting logic and data conversion, paving the way for scalable cryogenic architectures in quantum classical co-processors, low-power AI accelerators, and next generation energy constrained computing platforms.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of the Meissner and the Becker-London effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that the most fundamental property of a superconductor is that it exhibits the Meissner effect. Of similar importance is the Becker-London effect, i.e. generation of magnetic field inside a rotating superconductor. Hirsch has recently pointed out that, within the conventional theory of superconductivity, the question about how these effects are generated dynamically has not even been asked yet. Here we fill in this gap in the literature by a detailed study of the evolution of the electromagnetic field for both of these effects. To this end, we solve the Maxwell equations supplemented by the simplest conventional constitutive equation for a superconductor, namely the London equation. We demonstrate that, contrary to the expectations of Hirsch, the conventional theory does correctly describe the dynamics of both, the Meissner and the Becker-London effect. We find that the dynamics of the studied processes is quite rich and interesting even at this level of description.</description>

      <title>Free Majorana Modes in Superconducting Quantum Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An s-wave superconducting wire with attractive interactions can admit a zero-energy bound state equation (solution) at an edge similar to the Jackiw-Rebbi model; this is a specific aspect of low-dimensional quantum systems, Dirac equation and e.g. of the Luther-Emery liquid with a spin gap. In this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes, i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when including perturbations.</description>

      <title>SC$^*$ Superconductivity and Spin Stiffnesses in the SU(2) Gauge Theory of the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the SU(2) gauge theory for spin fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, where the electron field is fractionalized in terms of spinons and chargons. In this theory, spinons are described by a non-linear sigma model, while chargons are treated as fermions at a mean-field level. We investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC*, arising from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs. Consistent with previous studies, our analysis reveals a coexisting phase characterized by both magnetic and superconducting order for the chargons. The central contribution of this work is the calculation of the feedback of superconductivity on spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, thereby quantifying its impact on spin fluctuations. Our key finding is that superconductivity significantly suppresses these spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin fluctuations. This enhancement suggests that superconductivity can play a crucial role in stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic ordering.</description>

      <title>Leggett's plasma resonances and two-gap structures in the CVCs of MgB$_2$ break junctions $-$ a direct evidence for a two-gap superconductivity in MgB$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present investigation (2002) the current-voltage characteristics (CVCs) of break junctions in polycrystalline $MgB_2$ samples have been studied in the temperature range $4.2 K &lt; T &lt; T_c$. An inelastic Cooper pair tunneling accompanied by the emission of Leggett plasmons has been found for the first time in $MgB_2$ Josephson contacts. A fine structure in the CVCs of $MgB_2$ Andreev point contacts caused by a resonant emission of Leggett plasmons has been observed for the first time. An energy of the Leggett plasmon has been estimated: $E_0$ ~ 4 meV. Distinct two-gap structures have been found in the CVCs of $MgB_2$ tunneling contacts and $MgB_2$ Andreev point contacts with 7.5 meV $&lt; \Delta_L &lt;$ 11 meV and 1.5 meV $&lt; \Delta_S &lt;$ 2.5 meV. An intrinsic tunneling effect (ITE) and intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections effect (IMARE) have been observed due to the layered structure of $MgB_2$. The obtained experimental results give a direct evidence for a two-gap superconductivity in $MgB_2$. ("V. Tarasov's Readings", November 2002, Russia, Moscow, conference proceedings.)</description>

      <title>Quartet Tomography in Multiterminal Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of quartets in hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions. Using simple models of quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads, we find that quartets are ubiquitous and show how to rigorously extract their contribution to the current-phase relation (CPR). We also demonstrate that quartets are closely related to the hybridization of Andreev bound states (ABSs) in these systems and propose a method to identify quartets directly in ABS spectra. We illustrate our method by analyzing the spectroscopic measurements of the ABS spectrum in a three-terminal Josephson junction realized in an InAs/Al heterostructure. Our analysis strongly suggests the existence of quartets in the studied hybrid system.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze the amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum conductors attached to metallic reservoirs have been demonstrated to overcome the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), a trade-off relation between the amount of dissipation and the absence of charge and heat current fluctuations. Here, we report large TUR violations when superconducting reservoirs replace metallic ones. The coexistence of different transport processes, namely (multiple) Andreev reflection, where electrons and their retro-reflected holes create Cooper pairs, in addition to the normal quasiparticle transport is identified as the source for such TUR breakdowns. The large TUR violation is a remarkable advantage for building low dissipative and highly stable quantum thermal machines.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental advancements in dissipation control have yielded significant insights into non-hermitian Hamiltonians for open quantum systems. Of particular interest are the topological characteristics exhibited by these non-hermitian systems, that arise from exceptional points - distinct degeneracies unique to such systems. In this study, we focus on Andreev bound states in multiterminal Josephson junctions with non-hermiticity induced by normal metal or ferromagnetic leads. By investigating several systems of different synthetic dimensions and symmetries, we predict fragile and stable non-hermitian topological phases in these engineered superconducting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Reflectionless modes as a source of Weyl nodes in multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>

Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</description>

      <title>calcQPI: A versatile tool to simulate quasiparticle interference</title>

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelate LaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03750v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Momentum-Resolved Static Spin Susceptibility in a Mott-Proximate Cuprate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16884v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the temperature dependence of the static spin susceptibility at $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, 0)$ in a Mott-proximate cuprate model with an antinodal pseudogap -- a model system for high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates.
  The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\mathbf{q}=(\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly.
  It suggests that the emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\omega$ particle-hole phase space.</description>
