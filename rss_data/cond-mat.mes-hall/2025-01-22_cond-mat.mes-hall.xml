      <title>Realization of tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in superconducting circuit lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.</description>

      <title>Non-contact quantitative measurement of thermal Hall angle and transverse thermal conductivity by lock-in thermography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a non-contact quantitative measurement method for the thermal Hall effect (THE) based on magnetic-field-modulated lock-in thermography. This method enables visualization of THE-induced temperature change and quantitative estimation of the thermal Hall angle $\theta_{\rm THE}$ by applying periodic magnetic fields to a sample and obtaining the first harmonic response of thermal images. By combining this method with LIT-based measurement techniques for the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$, we also quantify the transverse thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$. We validate our measurement methods by estimating $\theta_{\rm THE}$, $\kappa_{xx}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$ in a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co$_2$MnGa slab showing large THE.</description>

      <title>Frozonium: Freezing Anharmonicity in Floquet Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering is a powerful method that can be used to modify the properties of interacting many-body Hamiltonians via the application of periodic time-dependent drives. Here we consider the physics of an inductively shunted superconducting Josephson junction in the presence of Floquet drives in the fluxonium regime and beyond, which we dub the frozonium artificial atom. We find that in the vicinity of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency, the many-body dynamics can be tuned to that of an effectively linear bosonic oscillator, with additional nonlinear corrections that are suppressed in higher powers of the drive frequency. By analyzing the inverse participation ratios between the time-evolved frozonium wavefunctions and the eigenbasis of a linear oscillator, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a novel dynamical control using a combination of numerical exact diagonalization and Floquet-Magnus expansion. We discuss the physics of resonances between quasi-energy states induced by the drive, and ways to mitigate their effects. We also highlight the enhanced protection of frozonium against external sources of noise present in experimental setups. This work lays the foundation for future applications in quantum memory and bosonic quantum control using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Multilayered MXenes for future two-dimensional nonvolatile magnetic memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MXenes have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their two-dimensional (2D) layered structure with various functionalities similar to the existing graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. Aiming to open a new application field for MXenes in the realm of electronic devices such as ultrahigh-integrated magnetic memory, we have developed a spin-orbit torque (SOT) bilayer structure consisting of bare MXene of Cr2N: substrate//Cr2N/[Co/Pt]3/MgO using magnetron sputtering technique. We demonstrate the field-free current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the Hall-cross configuration with the critical current density of ~30 MA/cm2. An attempt to replace the Cr2N layer by the Pt layer leads to the absence of field-free CIMS. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing the Cr2N thickness, the first-principles calculation predicts the pronounced orbital-Hall conductivity in the out-of-plane component, compared to the spin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N layer at the interface, by contacting with Co in the [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnetic layer. The interfacial spin-filtering-like effect against the out-of-plane polarized spin owing to the uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr might be a possible cause for the field-free CIMS. These results show a significant milestone in the advanced 2D-spintronics, promising low-power and ultrahigh-integration.</description>

      <title>Theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a general theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral phonons under an adiabatic process, in which atoms rotate around their equilibrium positions with a low phonon frequency. Here the spin magnetization originates from the modulated electronic states with spin-orbital coupling by atomic rotations. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time-dependent spin magnetization can be calculated by a Berry-phase method. In this paper, we focus on its time average, which is evaluated by assuming that the phonon displacement is small. As a result, the time average of the spin magnetization is concisely formulated in the form of the Berry curvature defined in the phonon-displacement space as an intrinsic property of atomic rotations. Our formula for spin magnetization reflects the chiral nature of phonons, and is convenient for $ab$ $initio$ calculations.</description>

      <title>Tuning magnetism in graphene nanoribbons via strain and adatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of strain and adsorbed H adatoms on the magnetic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a combination of tight-binding and density functional theory methods for both, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic edge configurations (AFM). Our study reveals that longitudinal strain induces a significant enhancement in the edge magnetic moment, that we attribute to strain-driven modifications in the band structure. In addition, we describe H~adatoms within the tight-binding approach by employing both an unrelaxed vacancy model and the Anderson impurity model. By comparing to density functional theory results, we corroborate that the Anderson impurity model is best suited to describe H adsorption. We then focus on the metallic FM edge configuration of the ZGNRs to better exploit the tuning of its properties. We find that the magnetic configuration of H~adatoms is strongly influenced by the edges, with an AFM coupling between edges and the H~adatom. In fact, the magnetic spatial pattern of the H adatom differs to that found in graphene due to this edge coupling. Importantly, we find robust discrete plateaus of integer magnetic moment as strain is varied in the defected ZGNRs, that we relate to changes in the band structure, namely, a half-metallic character or the opening of a gap. This behavior can be of interest for magnetic applications of carbon-based nanostructures</description>

      <title>Ordered InAs quantum dots on pre-patterned GaAs (0 0 1) by local oxidation nanolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered InAs quantum dot (QD) arrays have been obtained on pre-patterned GaAs (0 0 1) substrates by atomic force microscopy (AFM) local oxidation nanolithography. Prior to InAs molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) deposition, an ordered square array of nanoholes is formed at the GaAs pre-patterned surface following in situ etching with atomic hydrogen. A low substrate temperature is maintained during the whole process in order to avoid pattern smoothing. Our results show that the density and dimensions of the nanoholes on the GaAs surface determine InAs QD size, nucleation site and InAs dose necessary for their formation. As a function of the geometrical parameters of the nanohole array, we can obtain either ordered 2D arrays of separated QD, closely packed QD or localized areas for QD formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Stokes flow around a slowly moving sphere in a fluid with odd viscosity, focusing on a system of electrons in a Weyl semimetal with a single axis of asymmetry arising from broken time-reversal symmetry. We analyze the flow around the sphere, compute the Hall force acting perpendicular to its direction of motion, and study the implications for the Hall resistivity of Weyl semimetals in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding quantum dot circuits into microwave cavities has emerged as a novel platform for controlling photon emission statistics by electrical means. With such a model, we reveal previously undefined quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasing regimes by breaking the photon gain-loss balance condition. For one-photon interaction, the scaling theory indicates that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from thermal to coherent photon emissions, consistent with conventional laser physics. Going beyond this, a hidden discontinuous quantum phase transition from superbunched to coherent states in two-photon processes, accompanied by the bistability within a mean-field theory, is predicted. Our prediction, along with its extension to multiphoton processes, represents a key step towards accessing lasing phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Shot-noise-driven macroscopic vibrations and displacement transduction in quantum tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inherent randomness and the resulting stochastic behavior of fundamental particles manifested as quantum noise put a lower bound on measurement imprecision in the quantum measurement process. In addition, the quantum noise imparts decoherence and dephasing to the system being measured, referred to as the measurement back-action. While the microscopic effects of back-action have been observed, macroscopic evidence is a rarity. Here we report a macroscopic display of the back-action of an ultra-sensitive quantum point contact (QPC) electrical amplifier whose transport is defined by the quantum tunneling of electrons. The QPC amplifier, realized on GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, coupled to a planar superconducting resonator, operates at a frequency of 2.155 GHz in the shot-noise-limited regime. The shot-noise excitation of the mechanical modes and the resulting piezoelectric polarization enhancing the shot-noise at the mode frequencies form a positive feedback loop between the electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom. While the excitation of the vibrational modes is a display of the macroscopic effects of measurement back-action, the amplitudes of the noise peaks allow us to calibrate the displacement sensitivity of the QPC-resonator systems, which is in the order of 35 fm/SQRT(Hz) range, making it an excellent sensor for ultra-sensitive and fast strain or displacement detection.</description>

      <title>Refining Au/Sb alloyed ohmic contacts in undoped Si/SiGe strained quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow undoped Si/SiGe quantum wells are the leading platforms for hosting quantum processors based on spin-qubits. The ohmic contacts to the electron gas in these systems are accomplished by ion-implantation technique since the conventional Au/Sb alloyed contacts present a rough surface consisting of sharp islands and pits. These sharp protrusions cause electrical discharge across the gate-dielectric between the ohmic contacts and the accumulation-gates causing device break-down. A clear understanding of the surface morphology, elemental, compositional and electrical characterization of the alloyed region would enable one to engineer a smoother post alloyed surface. In this work, we find that the rough surface morphology is a cumulative effect of the Au/Si eutectic reaction and the threading dislocations inherent in the heterostructure. The structural, elemental, and chemical-state analysis show that the inverted pyramidal pits are resulting from the enhanced Au/Si eutectic reaction at the threading dislocations stemming from the heterostructure interface, while, the sharp protrusions causing accumulation gate-leakage are gold-rich precipitations. The protrusions are removed using an aqua regia treatment prior to the deposition of the gate-oxide and gate electrode. Exploiting a Hall bar device, we analyse the mobility and carrier concentration of the undoped Si/SiGe consisting of Au/Sb alloyed contacts down to 1.5 K. The measured mobility ~10^5 cm^2/Vs and carrier concentration of ~10^11/cm^2are comparable to the reported values on similar high-mobility heterostructures confirming the efficacy of our modified Au/Sb alloy technique in accomplishing high-efficiency contacts to undoped Si/SiGe heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Superlubric-Locked Transition of Twist Grain Boundaries in 3D Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of twist grain boundaries (TGB), long known structurally but not tribologically, are simulated under sliding and load, with Au(111) our test case. The load-free TGB moir\'e is smooth and superlubric at incommensurate twists. Strikingly, load provokes a first-order structural transformation, where the highest energy moir\'e nodes are removed -- an Aubry-type transition for which we provide a Landau theory and a twist-load phase diagram. Upon frictional sliding, the transformation causes a superlubric-locked transition, with a huge friction jump, and irreversible plastic flow. The predicted phenomena are robust, also recovered in a Lennard-Jones lattice TGB, and not exclusive to gold or to metals.</description>

      <title>High-throughput calculations of two-dimensional auxetic $M_4X_8$ with magnetism, electrocatalysis, and alkali metal battery applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with multifunctional properties, such as negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), magnetism, catalysis, and energy storage capabilities, are of significant interest for advanced applications in flexible electronics, spintronics, catalysis, and lithium-ion batteries. However, the discovery of such materials, particularly in low-dimensional forms, remains a challenge. In this study, we perform high-throughput density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore a new class of 2D V-shaped monolayers with remarkable physicochemical properties. Among 18 stable $M_4X_8$ (M = transition metal; X = halogen) compounds, we identify 9 auxetic monolayers, with \ce{Pd4I8} standing out for its exceptionally high NPR of -0.798. Notably, 4 of these materials exhibit half semiconductor properties, while 5 others are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, offering a unique combination of electronic and magnetic behavior. Additionally, these materials demonstrate promising catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) and show potential as anodes for rechargeable metal-ion batteries, particularly in alkali-ion systems. This work not only expands the family of 2D NPR materials but also introduces new candidates with multifunctional capabilities for a wide range of applications in nanoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Overdamped van der Waals Josephson junctions by area engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vW) Josephson junctions (JJs) realized by stacking materials such as few-layered NbSe2, offers a new landscape to realize superconducting quantum devices with superior properties owing to its crystalline nature and defect-free junctions. For quantum technology, overdamped JJs are highly sought-after, whose realization demands precise control of junction capacitance by engineering the junction area using microfabrication techniques. NbSe2 is highly reactive and susceptible to damage during microfabrication processes. In this manuscript, we demonstrate both underdamped and overdamped NbSe2-NbSe2 JJs by controlling the junction area. We devise a minimally invasive microfabrication procedure, post-junction formation, to precisely control the junction area. The McCumber parameter characterizing the damping is extracted from the electrical transport measurements down to 130 mK. The results show that our sample fabrication recipe has preserved the material qualities and paved the way for the realization of scalable JJ devices on NbSe2 and similar systems.</description>

      <title>Stability and Nucleation of Dipole Strings in Uniaxial Chiral Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the stability of the magnetic dipole string (DS), a three-dimensional magnetic texture formed by two coupled Bloch points with opposite topological charges, separated by an equilibrium distance. Previous studies demonstrated the stability of such configurations through geometric confinement or coupling with local perturbations in the magnetization field, such as skyrmion strings or dislocations in helical modulations. Here, we show that, in uniaxial chiral magnets, an isolated DS remains stable in an unperturbed vacuum, thus representing a true three-dimensional soliton. The phase diagram illustrates the stability of the DS embedded in the conical or helical phases across a broad range of material parameters and external magnetic fields. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method applied to a regularized micromagnetic model, we demonstrate that isolated DSs are protected from collapse by an energy barrier. Stochastic spin-lattice simulations demonstrate that DSs can spontaneously nucleate during in-field annealing. This work aims to stimulate the experimental observation of DSs and further exploration of uniaxial chiral magnets.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven resonant soft-X-ray scattering for probing picosecond dynamics of nanometre-scale order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray scattering has been an indispensable tool in advancing our understanding of matter, from the first evidence of the crystal lattice to recent discoveries of nuclei's fastest dynamics. In addition to the lattice, ultrafast resonant elastic scattering of soft X-rays provides a sensitive probe of charge, spin, and orbital order with unparalleled nanometre spatial and femto- to picosecond temporal resolution. However, the full potential of this technique remains largely unexploited due to its high demand on the X-ray source. Only a selected number of instruments at large-scale facilities can deliver the required short-pulsed and wavelength-tunable radiation, rendering laboratory-scale experiments elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate time-resolved X-ray scattering with spectroscopic contrast at a laboratory-based instrument using the soft-X-ray radiation emitted from a laser-driven plasma source. Specifically, we investigate the photo-induced response of magnetic domains emerging in a ferrimagnetic heterostructure with 9$\,$ps temporal resolution. The achieved sensitivity allows for tracking the reorganisation of the domain network on pico- to nanosecond time scales in great detail. This instrumental development and experimental demonstration break new ground for studying material dynamics in a wide range of laterally ordered systems in a flexible laboratory environment.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Responses of Generalized Landau Levels: Structure Factor and the Quantized Hall Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new geometric characterization of generalized Landau levels (GLLs). The GLLs are a generalization of Landau levels to non-uniform Berry curvature, and are mathematically defined in terms of a holomorphic curve -- an ideal K\"ahler band -- and its associated unitary Frenet-Serret moving frame. Here, we find that GLLs are harmonic maps from the Brillouin zone to the complex projective space and they are critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional, as well as the static structure factor up to fourth order. We also find that filled GLLs exhibit quantized Hall viscosity, similar to the ordinary Landau levels. These results establish GLLs as a versatile generalization of Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Approach to Josephson Dot Dynamics and Application to Quantum Mpemba Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Green's function approach for the nonequilibrium dynamics of multi-level quantum dots coupled to multiple fermionic reservoirs in the presence of a bosonic environment. Our theory is simpler than the Keldysh approach and goes beyond scattering state constructions. In concrete terms, we study Josephson junctions containing a quantum dot and coupled to an electromagnetic environment. In the dot region, spin-orbit interactions, a Zeeman field, and in principle also Coulomb interactions can be included. We then study quantum Mpemba effects, assuming that the average phase difference across the Josephson junction is subject to a rapid quench. For a short singlechannel junction, we show that both types of quantum Mpemba effects allowed in open quantum systems are possible. We also study an intermediate-length junction, where spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman field are included. Again quantum Mpemba effects are predicted.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of local photoconductivity in GaAs and InP investigated by THz SNOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz scanning near-field optical microscope (THz-SNOM) is employed to measure ultrafast evolution of THz conductivity spectra after photoexcitation of GaAs and InP wafers using ultrashort laser pulses. Unlike in GaAs, the THz photoconductivity decay in InP is controlled mainly by the diffusion of electrons away from the photoexcited area, and also by the drift due to band-bending at the surface of the semiconductor. We propose and discuss several general strategies of the analysis of signals measured using THz-SNOM, and we estimate the accuracy of the obtained near-field photoconductivity spectra.</description>

      <title>Andreev spin relaxation time in a shadow-evaporated InAs weak link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andreev spin qubits are a new qubit platform that merges superconductivity with semiconductor physics. The mechanisms dominating observed energy relaxation remain unidentified. We report here on three steps taken to address these questions in an InAs nanowire weak link. First, we designed a microwave readout circuit tuned to be directly sensitive to the spin-dependent inductance of the weak link so that higher orbital states are not necessary for readout -- this resulted in larger windows in parameter space in which the spin state properties can be probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering strategy to mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was fabricated by \textit{in situ} shadow evaporation, which has been shown to improve atomic-scale disorder. We show how our design allows characterization of the spin stability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and gate voltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasing rates are comparable with the best devices previously reported, suggestive that surface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are not linked to spin relaxation in InAs nanowires. Our design strategies are transferrable to novel materials platforms for Andreev qubits such as germanium and carbon.</description>

      <title>Imaging signatures of edge currents in a magnetic topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) host topologically protected edge states, but the role that these edge states play in electronic transport remains unclear. Using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy, we performed local measurements of the current distribution in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at large bias currents, where the quantization of the conductivity tensor breaks down. We find that bulk currents in the channel interior coexist with edge currents at the sample boundary. While the position of the edge current changes with the reversal of the magnetic field, it does not depend on the current direction. To understand our observations, we introduce a model which includes contributions from both the sample magnetization and currents driven by chemical potential gradients. To parameterize our model, we use local measurements of the chemical potential induced changes in the sample magnetization. Our model reveals that the observed edge currents can be understood as changes in the magnetization generated by the electrochemical potential distribution in the sample under bias. Our work underscores the complexity of electronic transport in MTIs and highlights both the value and challenges of using magnetic imaging to disentangle various contributions to the electronic transport signatures.</description>

      <title>Quantum confining excitons with electrostatic moir\'e superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum confining excitons has been a persistent challenge in the pursuit of strong exciton interactions and quantum light generation. Unlike electrons, which can be readily controlled via electric fields, imposing strong nanoscale potentials on excitons to enable quantum confinement has proven challenging. In this study, we utilize piezoresponse force microscopy to image the domain structures of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), revealing evidence of strong in-plane electric fields at the domain boundaries. By placing a monolayer MoSe2 only one to two nanometers away from the twisted hBN interface, we observe energy splitting of neutral excitons and Fermi polarons by several millielectronvolts at the moir\'e domain boundaries. By directly correlating local structural and optical properties, we attribute such observations to excitons confined in a nanoscale one-dimensional electrostatic potential created by the strong in-plane electric fields at the moir\'e domain boundaries. Intriguingly, this 1D quantum confinement results in pronounced polarization anisotropy in the excitons' reflection and emission, persistent to temperatures as high as ~80 Kelvins. These findings open new avenues for exploring and controlling strongly interacting excitons for classical and quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Self-aligned multilayered nitrogen vacancy diamond nanoparticles for high spatial resolution magnetometry of microelectronic currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen Vacancy diamond nanoparticles (NVNPs) are increasingly integrated with methods for optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR), providing new opportunities in magnetic characterization that span the visualization of magnetic fields in microelectronic circuits, environmental sensing and biology. However, only a small number of studies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry being that spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned, precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared with expensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layering NVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitate superior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined with simplified probe preparation. We present a novel technology for creating densely stacked monolayers of NVNP with inherent interlayer alignment for sensitive measurement of local magnetic field perturbations in microelectronic traces. We establish spatial characteristics of deposited aggregates and demonstrate their ability to capture magnetic dipoles from conducting microwires via ODMR. Our approach forms a novel accessible protocol that can be used for broad applications in micromagnetometry.</description>

      <title>Influence of conjugated structure for tunable molecular plasmons in peropyrene and its derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in research have sparked an increasing curiosity in understanding the plasmonic excitation properties of molecular-scale systems. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as the fundamental building blocks of graphene, have been documented to possess plasmonic properties through experimental observations, making them prime candidates for investigation. By doping different elements, the conjugated structure of the molecule can be altered. In this study, the plasmonic excitation properties influenced by conjugated structures in peropyrene and its derivatives are investigated through first-principles calculations that combine the plasmonicity index, generalized plasmonicity index and transition contribution maps. For molecular plasmonic excitation, the conjugated structure can influence the oscillation modes of valence electrons, which is pivotal in yielding distinct field enhancement characteristics. Furthermore, charge doping can lead to a certain degree of alteration in the conjugated structures, and the doping of elements will result in varying degrees of such alteration, thereby initiating different trends in the evolution of plasmonic resonance. This further enhances the tunability of molecular plasmonic resonance. The results provide novel insights into the development and utilization of molecular plasmonic devices in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature quantum emission from $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS:Cu colloidal nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report room-temperature observations of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ quantum emitters in individual ZnS:Cu nanocrystals (NCs). Using time-gated imaging, we isolate the distinct, $\sim$3-$\mu$s-long, red photoluminescence (PL) emission of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects, enabling their precise identification and statistical characterization. The emitters exhibit distinct blinking and photon antibunching, consistent with individual NCs containing two to four $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects. The quantum emitters' PL spectra show a pronounced blue shift compared to NC dispersions, likely due to photochemical and charging effects. Emission polarization measurements of quantum emitters are consistent with a $\sigma$-character optical dipole transition and the symmetry of the $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defect. These observations motivate further investigation of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS NCs for use in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the presence of chiral spin states in molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a three-spin-center system, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions give rise to two ground-state doublets, each state within the doublet exhibiting distinct spin-spectrum chirality. This chirality becomes significant when external perturbations are introduced. We explored, from a theoretical perspective, the presence of spin-chirality in Lanthanide complexes that feature two magnetic centers. The applied electric-potential, couples to the system electric dipole moment ($\mu$), modifying the spin-orbit interaction ($\hat{L}.\hat{S}$). This modification is formally expressed through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), whose role is to selectively activate one spin state in the doublet pair, as confirmed by computing the scalar spin-chirality ($\chi$). To validate the presence of chiral spin states, we performed spin-dynamics simulations using the Liouville-von Neumann equation within the density matrix formalism. The initial state was prepared as a superposition $1/\sqrt{2}(\rho_{01}+\rho_{10})$, and its time evolution revealed that each state in the doublet acquires a distinct phase, indicating their residence in separate phase spaces. This also demonstrated that the fidelity of the initial prepared state remains stable over an extended period.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale functionalization of MoS$_2$ monolayers with DNA origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functionalization of two-dimensional (2D) materials with organic molecules is a promising approach for realizing nanoscale optoelectronic devices with tailored functionalities, such as quantum light generation and p-n junctions. However, achieving control over the molecules' precise positioning on the 2D material remains a significant challenge. Here, we overcome the limitations of solution- and vapor deposition methods and use a DNA origami placement technique to spatially arrange various organic molecules on a chip surface at the single-molecule level with high assembly yields. This versatile method allows for precise patterning of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with organic molecules, including thiols and fluorescent dyes. We successfully integrated MoS$_2$ monolayers with micron-scale molecule-origami patterns achieving both single photon emission from thiol-induced localized excitons in MoS$_2$ and photoexcitation energy transfer with patterned fluorescent dyes. Our approach offers a pathway for producing complex, tailored 2D inorganic-organic heterostructures with molecular-level control, opening up new possibilities for advanced materials and device design.</description>

      <title>Coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes photogenerated with large kinetic energy in lead halide perovskite crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes are studied in a FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite bulk crystal, using time-resolved Kerr ellipticity in a two-color pump-probe scheme. The probe photon energy is tuned to the exciton resonance, while the pump photon energy is detuned from it up to 0.75 eV to higher energies. The spin-oriented electrons and holes photogenerated with significant excess kinetic energy relax into states in vicinity of the band gap, where they undergo Larmor precession in an external magnetic field. At cryogenic temperatures down to 1.6 K, the spin dephasing time reaches the nanosecond range. During energy relaxation, the carrier spin relaxation is inefficient and only happens when the carriers become localized. In experiments with two pump pulses, all-optical control of the amplitudes and phases of the electron and hole spin signals is achieved in the additive regime by varying the intensities of the pump pulses and the time delay between them.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian wave-packet dynamics and its realization within a non-Hermitian chiral cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological wave-packet dynamics provide a powerful framework for studying quantum transport in topological materials. However, extending this approach to non-Hermitian quantum systems presents several important challenges, primarily due to ambiguities in defining the Berry phase and the non-unitary evolution of the wave-packets when $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is broken. In this work, we adopt the complex Berry phase definition using the bi-orthogonal formalism and derive the semiclassical equations of motion (EOM) for a wave-packet in a non-Hermitian topological system. Interestingly, we find that the complex Berry curvature introduces both an anomalous velocity and an anomalous force into the semiclassical EOM. To validate the derived EOM, we design a non-Hermitian Haldane model featuring non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, where the imbalance in the NNN hopping amplitudes gives rise to an emergent `complex chirality'. We reveal that the real and imaginary components of the complex chirality dictate the signs of both the real and imaginary parts of the complex Berry curvature, as well as the direction and dissipation rate of the edge states. Our analytical findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the wave-packet dynamics. Finally, we suggest a potential experimental realization of this complex Haldane model using a non-Hermitian optical chiral cavity, providing a promising platform for testing our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Collective Dynamics in Liquids and the Dual Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic vision is presented of a Dual Model of Liquids from a solid picture. Among the novelties of this model is that it provides quantitative expressions of various extensive thermophysical properties. The introduction of the statistical number of excited degrees of freedom (DoF) allows bypassing the problem of other dual models which are sometimes unable to correctly reproduce the expressions for those thermophysical quantities showing deviations due to the activation or deactivation of internal DoF. The interpretation of the relaxation times is given, their Order of Magnitude calculated and the way in which these times are involved in the different phases of the collective dynamics of liquids is discussed. A comparison is provided with results obtained in the frame of another phononic model of liquids, as well as with the predictions for the viscoelastic transition regions and with systems exhibiting kgap. In the last part of the paper, theoretical insights and experiments are suggested as potential directions for future research and development.</description>

      <title>Rubidium intercalation in epitaxial monolayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alkali metal intercalation of graphene layers has been of particular interest due to potential applications in electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. Rubidium (Rb) is one of the largest alkali metals and the one less investigated as intercalant. Here, we report a systematic investigation, with a multi-technique approach, of the phase formation of Rb under epitaxial monolayer graphene on SiC(0001). We explore a wide phase space with two control parameters: the Rb density (i.e., deposition time) and sample temperature (i.e., room- and low-temperature). We reveal the emergence of $(2 \times 2)$ and $(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3})$R30{\deg} structures formed by a single alkali metal layer intercalated between monolayer graphene and the interfacial C-rich reconstructed surface, also known as buffer layer. Rb intercalation also results in a strong n-type doping of the graphene layer. Progressively annealing to high temperatures, we first reveal diffusion of Rb atoms which results in the enlargement of intercalated areas. As desorption sets in, intercalated regions progressively shrink and fragment. Eventually, at approximately 600{\deg}C the initial surface is retrieved, indicating the reversibility of the intercalation process.</description>

      <title>Spin-Degenerate Bulk Bands and Topological Surface States of RuO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel platform to realize exotic electromagnetic properties distinct from those of conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, of which altermagnetic nature has been under fierce debate. We have elucidated the band structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single crystal. We found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the experimental band structures obtained by ARPES commonly show a semi-quantitative agreement with the bulk-band calculation for the nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with that for the antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a negligible spin polarization for the bulk bands. These results suggest the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting. Furthermore, we identified a flat surface band and a dispersive one near the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively, both of which are attributed to the topological surface states associated with the bulk Dirac nodal lines. The present ARPES results suggest that the crystal-orientation-dependent topological surface/interface states need to be taken into account to properly capture the transport and catalytic characteristics of RuO2.</description>

      <title>Magnetic switching of phonon angular momentum in a ferrimagnetic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonons, which carry circular atomic motions, offer a new route for mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon angular momentum without altering the material's structure or composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching 2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations. Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer scale.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Surface Reconstructions in Thin-Films of Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of surface states and their exchange gaps in magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) thin films is crucial for achieving robust topological Chern and Axion insulating phases where the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect and the Topological Magneto-electric Effect can be realized. Here, we focus on the rather unexplored issue of how surface reconstructions, which are likely to occur in experiments, influence these properties. Using first-principles calculations together with molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by machine learning force field, we demonstrate that interstitial-2H and peripheral-2H type atomic reconstructions are responsible for modifying the exchange gap and surface characteristics of MBT thin films, with important implications for the topological indices and the nature of quasi one-dimensional side-wall edge states dominating quantum transport. \textcolor{blue}{Specifically, the calculation of the energy landscape and barriers for the proposed surface reconstructions indicates that the interstitial-2H reconstruction is thermodynamically more stable than the peripheral-2H reconstruction. The latter case is also hypothesized as providing a plausible explanation for the Rashba surface states observed} in Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our analysis provides a theoretical framework to elucidate the nature and effect of reconstructions in MBT thin films, with predictions for the experimental realization of different topological phases.</description>

Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kitaev spin liquid (KSL), consisting of the bond direction-dependent spin interactions in the honeycomb lattice, attracts huge attention because of its exact solvability and prospect for applications to quantum computing. An important feature of KSL is the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity (HQTHC) under the magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice, but HQTHC stands only at low temperatures. Here, in the temperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically propose the extrinsic phonon contribution to thermal Hall Effect in KSL via the skew-scattering of chiral phonons by the scalar spin chirality, which was previously studied in Mott insulators. We show the emergence of the scalar spin chirality of fluctuating spins, estimate the emergent field strength and its symmetric form applied to the chiral phonons, and obtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity, which is semi-quantitatively consistent with the existing experiments. This work provides a basic understanding of the role of spin-phonon interactions in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model optomechanical systems, in which the coupling between an optical field and a mechanical resonator is described by linear, quadratic, and cubic terms in mechanical displacements, are studied. It is shown that under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the cavity field, the dynamics of the mechanical resonator is determined by some effective, generally bistable, potential. The shape of this potential depends on the power of the optical driving field, detuning between the cavity and driving frequencies, the parameters of nonlinear optomechanical interactions and the decay rate of the cavity field. Examples of both periodic and chaotic behavior of the mechanical resonator are illustrated by determining the power spectrum of mechanical oscillations, constructing the corresponding phase portraits and Poincar\'{e} maps.</description>

Abstract: High-precision sensors are of fundamental importance in modern society and technology.Although numerous sensors have been developed, obtaining sensors with higher levels of sensitivity and stronger robustness has always been expected. Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a novel class of sensors with superior performances based on exotic properties of highorder non-Hermitian topological physics. The frequency shift induced by perturbations for these sensors can show an exponential growth with respect to the size of the device, which can well beyond the limitations of conventional sensors. The fully integrated circuit chips have been designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology. The sensitivity of systems not only less than 0.001fF has been experimentally verified, they are also robust against disorders.Our proposed ultra-sensitive integrated circuit sensors can possess a wide range of applications in various fields and show an exciting prospect for next-generation sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Epitaxial Laterally Overgrown Diamond: Towards Up-scaling of Color Center-based Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.</description>

Abstract: Nanocrystals of indium oxide (In$_2$O$_3$) with sizes below 10 nm were prepared in alumina matrixes by using a co-pulverization method. The used substrates such as borosilicate glasses or (100) silicon as well as the substrate temperatures during the deposition process were modified and their effects characterized on the structural and physical properties of alumina-In$_2$O$_3$ films. Complementary investigation methods including X-ray diffraction, optical transmittance in the range 250-1100 nm and transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze the nanostructured films. The crystalline order, morphology and optical responses were monitored as function of the deposition parameters and the post-synthesis annealing. The optimal conditions were found and allow realizing suitable nanostructured films with a major crystalline order of cubic phase for the In$_2$O$_3$ nanocrystals. The optical properties of the films were analyzed and the key parameters such as direct and indirect band gaps were evaluated as function of the synthesis conditions and the crystalline quality of the films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insects like dragonflies and cicadas possess nanoprotusions on their wings that rupture bacterial membranes upon contact, inspiring synthetic antibacterial surfaces mimicking this phenomenon. Designing such biomimetic surfaces requires understanding the mechanical interaction between nanopillars and bacterial membranes. However, the small scales of these interactions pose challenges. Molecular Dynamics simulations offer precise and efficient modeling at these scales. This study presents a coarse-grained membrane model to explore the mechanical responses of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes to nanopillar arrays. By varying bacterial shapes (spherical and cylindrical), membrane bending rigidity, and loading rates, we identified two distinct failure mechanisms. Low bending rigidity, typical of gram-negative bacteria, leads to tearing near nanopillar tips, contrary to prior assumptions. High bending rigidity, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria, results in puncturing at contact points. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant, requiring a threefold increase in loading rate for effective piercing. Nanopillar height and spacing also critically impact bactericidal efficacy: greater heights enhance activity beyond a critical threshold, while increased spacing reduces efficacy. This simplified coarse-grained model, representing bacterial membranes with high fidelity, enables cost-effective, full-scale simulations over extended periods. Our findings provide essential insights for optimizing nanopillared surface designs, advancing antibacterial technology through tailored height and spacing configurations.</description>

Abstract: We present a general mechanism for large charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures with a noncoplanar spin texture, formulated in terms of quantum-geometric phases. We present necessary conditions for this effect to occur, and show numerical results for disordered materials, relevant for applications. We calculate Josephson diode efficiencies for both charge- and spin-diodes and show that a spin-diode efficiency of 100% can be reached. Finally, we present a SQUID device that can switch between nearly pure spin-up and spin-down equal-spin supercurrents across the ferromagnet by reversing the flux. These findings establish functionalities that are absent for coplanar spin textures.</description>

      <title>Time-optimal transfer of the quantum state in long qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed the fabrication of large arrays of coupled qubits serving as prototypes of quantum processors. However, the optimal control of such systems is notoriously hard, which limits the potential of large-scale quantum systems. Here, we investigate a model problem of quantum state transfer in a large nearest-neighbor-coupled qubit array and derive an optimal control that simultaneously enables maximal fidelity and minimal time of the transfer.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian $k$-Locality is the Key Resource for Powerful Quantum Battery Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Storing and extracting energy using quantum degrees of freedom is a promising approach to leveraging quantum effects in energy science. Early experimental efforts have already demonstrated its potential to surpass the charging power of existing technologies. In this context, it is crucial to identify the specific quantum effects that can be exploited to design the most efficient quantum batteries and push their performance to the ultimate limit. While entanglement has often been considered a key factor in enhancing charging (or discharging) power, our findings reveal that it is not as critical as previously thought. Instead, three parameters emerge as the most significant in determining the upper bound of instantaneous charging power: the locality of the battery and charger Hamiltonians, and the maximum energy storable in a single unit cell of the battery. To derive this new bound, we have also addressed several open questions previously noted in the literature but lacks an explanation. This bound provides a foundation for designing the most powerful charger-battery systems, where combined optimization of both components offers enhancements that cannot be achieved by manipulating only one of them.</description>

      <title>Multiterminal Josephson junctions with tunable topological properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the Andreev reflection process at normal-metal/superconductor junctions and the corresponding Andreev bound states in superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor junctions, various multiterminal Josephson junctions have been studied to explore many exotic phases of quantum matter, where the formation of Andreev bound states in the normal region account for dissipationless supercurrent and play a central role in determining exotic properties. Recently, an intriguing aspect of the multiterminal Josephson junctions has been proposed to study the topological properties, wherein the Andreev bound states acquire topological characteristics upon tuning the phase differences of superconducting terminals. In this work, we investigate topologically non-trivial phases in four-terminal Josephson junctions based on square and graphene lattices. Additionally, we apply a gating potential that smoothly drives the Andreev bound states from a topologically non-trivial state to a trivial state. Furthermore, we observe that the gating potential in our setup produces the similar physics of the topological Andreev bound states of the double (single) quantum-dot multiterminal Josephson junctions when the gating potential is small (large) compared to the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>A glance to Luttinger liquid and its platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectories and Page-curve entanglement dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy. Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Schr\"odinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</description>

      <title>Building unconventional magnetic phases on graphene by H atom manipulation: From altermagnets to Lieb ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering all fundamental magnetic phases within a single material platform would mark a significant milestone in materials science and spintronics, reducing complexity and costs in device fabrication by eliminating the need for integrating and interfacing different materials. Here, we demonstrate that graphene can host all non-relativistic magnetic phases-namely, diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, altermagnetism and fully compensated ferrimagnetism -- by using single hydrogen atoms as building blocks. Through precise manipulation of these atoms by scanning tunneling microscopy, we can experimentally create all such magnetic phases. Their different magnetic character is confirmed by density functional theory and mean-field Hubbard calculations. In particular, we show that the new magnetic paradigm known as altermagnetism can be realized, exhibiting directionally spin-split energy bands coexisting with zero net magnetization due to protecting spatial symmetries. It is furthermore possible to create fully compensated ferrimagnets, lacking these symmetries and therefore presenting unrestricted spin splitting of the bands, with a vanishing net magnetization which in this case is protected by Lieb's theorem. These findings put forward H-functionalized graphene as a versatile platform to design, build and study these new emergent magnetic phases at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect in time-reversal breaking system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect is known to be intrinsic and requires time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that a new type of magneto-nonlinear Hall effect can occur in the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum origin arising from a geometric quantity associated with the Berry curvature and band velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking system by proposing a new kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Topological Insulators via Momentum-Space Nonsymmorphic Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of the Brillouin zone, foundational in topological physics, is always assumed to be a torus. We theoretically report the construction of Brillouin real projective plane ($\mathrm{RP}^2$) and the appearance of quadrupole insulating phase, which are enabled by momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries stemming from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synthetic gauge fields. We show that the momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries quantize bulk polarization and Wannier-sector polarization nonlocally across different momenta, resulting in quantized corner charges and an isotropic binary bulk quadrupole phase diagram, where the phase transition is triggered by a bulk energy gap closing. Under open boundary conditions, the nontrivial bulk quadrupole phase manifests either trivial or nontrivial edge polarization, resulting from the violation of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries under lattice termination. We present a concrete design for the $\mathrm{RP}^2$ quadrupole insulator based on acoustic resonator arrays and discuss its feasibility in optics, mechanics, and electrical circuits. Our results show that deforming the Brillouin manifold creates opportunities for realizing high-order band topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to transport single electrons on a quantum dot array dramatically increases the freedom in designing quantum computation schemes that can be implemented on solid-state devices. So far, however, routing schemes to precisely control the transport paths of single electrons have yet to be established. Here, we propose a silicon single-electron router that transports pumped electrons along the desired route on the branches of a T-shaped quantum dot array by inputting a synchronous phase-controlled signal to multiple gates. Notably, we show that it is possible to achieve a routing accuracy above 99\% by boosting the accuracy of the electron-transport timing with an assist gate in front of the branching paths. We also evaluated the minimum error rate of routing by the model of electron transport based on the Wigner representation in an energy-time space. The results suggest new possibilities for fast and accurate transport of single electrons on the two-dimensional quantum dot arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09110v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a nonlinear optical response of a planar microcavity with an embedded transition metal dicalcogenide monolayer when the energy of a biexcitonic transition is brought in resonance with the energy of a cavity mode. We demonstrate that the emission spectrum of this system strongly depends on an external pump. For small and moderate pumps, we reveal the presence of a doublet in the emission with the corresponding Rabi splitting scaling as a square root of the number of the excitations in the system. Further increase of the pump leads to the reshaping of the spectrum, which demonstrates, at weak damping, the pattern akin a Mollow triplet. An intermediate pumping regime shows a broad irregular spectrum reminiscent of a chaotic dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Pseudospin Injection Beyond Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible to conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, optical pseudospin injection (OPI) beyond ordinary Weyl semimetals (WSMs), specifically in multi-WSMs (mWSMs) and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OPI in mWSMs is independent of the frequency of the light and linearly proportional to the quantized topological charge as a consequence of the inherent band linearity in their dispersions. Interestingly, while the response does not depend on the tilting of a type-I node, it is a decreasing function of the same in type-II mWSMs. We also reveal that the frequency independence can be destroyed either by going beyond a certain cutoff frequency under lattice regularization or by going to a higher-order Weyl phase. The predicted signatures of OPI beyond the ordinary WSM could be experimentally exploited, leading to effective access as well as distinguishing between different nontrivial Weyl topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in two-dimensional compensated antiferromagnets without net spin magnetization.} We consider antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a concrete example. \textcolor{blue}{By breaking the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry of even-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, we find that the system can host the QAHE with a nonzero Chern number.} We show that by controlling the antiferromagnetic spin configuration, for example, down/up/up/down that breaks $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, tetralayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ can host a Chern number $\mathcal{C}=-1$. Such spin configuration can be stabilized by pinning the spin orientations of the surfaces. \textcolor{blue}{Furthermore, via tuning the on-site orbital energy and vertical electric fields, we find rich QAHE phases with tunable Chern number of $|\mathcal{C}|=1, 2, 3$. In addition, we reveal that the edge states are layer-selective and primarily locate at the boundaries of the bottom and top layers. Our work not only proposes a scheme to realize Chern number tunable QAHE in antiferromagnets without net spin magnetization, but also provides a platform for layer-selective dissipationless transport devices.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of valley-coherent dark excitons in a high-angle incommensurate Moir\'e homobilayer</title>

Abstract: The last few years have witnessed a surge in interest and research efforts in the field of twistronics, especially in low-angle twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalocogenides. These novel material platforms have been demonstrated to host periodic arrays of excitonic quantum emitters, interlayer excitons with long lifetimes, and exotic many-body states. While much remains to be known and understood about these heterostructures, the field of large-angle, incommensurate bilayers is even less explored. At twist angles larger than a few degrees, the presence of periodicity in these bilayers becomes chaotic, making the systems essentially aperiodic and incommensurate in nature due to the limitations of fabrication techniques. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of a brightened dark intralayer exciton in twisted n-doped molybdenum diselenide homobilayer. We show that this dark exciton diffuses across the excitation spot more efficiently as compared to bright trions or excitons, reaching diffusion lengths greater than 4 microns. Temperature-dependent spectra provide corroborative evidence and reveal a brightened dark trion. Almost inexplicably, this dark exciton showcases a robust valley coherence, which we attribute to a small mixing of the spin-resolved conduction bands due to an absence of out-of-plane reflection symmetry arising from a strong dielectric contrast. Our results reveal some of the richness of the physics of these large-angle systems while uncovering new opportunities for valleytronic devices that may utilize these more valley-robust "mixed" dark excitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical emission spectra of semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers highlight fascinating recombination processes of charged excitons (trions). When charge tunable WSe$_2$ monolayers are moderately doped with electrons, a strong luminescence peak emerges just below the well-understood spectral lines associated with the recombination of negatively charged bright and dark trions. Despite previous investigations, its origin remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that this luminescence peak is the result of electron-electron assisted recombination that brightens the dark trion emission. Supporting evidence for this second-order recombination process comes from identifying the brightened emission of positively charged dark trions when the monolayer is electrostatically doped with holes. Remarkably, the discovered hole-hole assisted luminescence peak emerges in the near infrared, about 500 meV below the well-studied spectral region of excitons and trions. In magneto-photoluminescence experiments we find that the $g$-factor of this new transition ($g$ = +4) has an opposite sign compared to the well-known $g$-factor of neutral or charged excitons. This allows us to propose a mechanism of brightening of the positively charged dark trion involving the $\Gamma$ valence band.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the orbital flux phase in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ from polar Kerr effect</title>

Abstract: The $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) family of Kagome metals hosts unconventional charge density wave order whose nature is still an open puzzle. Accumulated evidences point to a time-reversal symmetry breaking orbital flux phase that carries loop currents. Such an order may support anomalous Hall effect. However, the polar Kerr effect measurements that probe the a.c. anomalous Hall conductivity seems to have yielded contradictory results. We first argue on symmetry grounds that some previously proposed orbital flux order, most notably the one with Star-of-David distortion, shall not give rise to anomalous Hall or polar Kerr effects. We further take the tri-hexagonal orbital flux phase as an exemplary Kagome flux order that does exhibit anomalous Hall response, and show that the Kerr rotation angle at two relevant experimental optical frequencies generally reaches microradians to sub-milliradians levels. A particularly sharp resonance enhancement is observed at around $\hbar \omega =1$ eV, suggesting exceedingly large Kerr rotation at the corresponding probing frequencies not yet accessed by previous experiments. Our study can help to interpret the Kerr measurements on $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and to eventually resolve the nature of their CDW order.</description>

      <title>Scaling up a sign-ordered Kitaev chain without magnetic flux control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a new and promising material platform for realizing topological Kitaev chains. So far, experiments have implemented a two-site chain with limited protection. Here we propose an experimentally feasible protocol for scaling up the chain in order to enhance the protection of the Majorana zero modes. To this end, we make use of the fact that the relative sign of normal and superconducting hoppings mediated by an Andreev bound state can be changed by electrostatic gates. In this way, our method only relies on the use of individual electrostatic gates on hybrid regions, quantum dots, and tunnel barriers, respectively, without the need for individual magnetic flux control, greatly simplifying the device design. Our work provides guidance for realizing a topologically protected Kitaev chain, which is the building block of error-resilient topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced Majorana modes in a nodal topological superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phase diagram of an extension of the Haldane model with equal spin pairing superconductivity. In two dimensions, we find a topological nodal superconducting phase, which exhibits a chiral Majorana mode propagating along the edges of nanoribbons with cylindrical boundary conditions. This phase is however unstable in a finite two-dimensional rectangular-shaped lattice, yielding corner states close to zero energy in a flake with alternating zigzag and armchair edges. When we reduce one of the dimensions, quantum confinement gaps out the bulk bands faster than the edge states. In this scenario, hybridization between the edge states can then result in Majorana zero modes. Our results hence suggest quantum confinement as a crucial ingredient in building quasi-one-dimensional topological superconducting phases out of two-dimensional nodal topological superconductors. Furthermore, we characterize the emergence of this novel topological phase by means of its topological invariant, coinciding with a quantized conductance of $2 e^2/h$ in a normal-superconducting junction.</description>

      <title>Periodic source of energy-entangled electrons in helical states coupled to a BCS superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a source of purely electronic energy-entangled states implemented in a solid-state system with potential applications in quantum information protocols based on electron flying qubits. The proposed device relies on the standard tools of Electron Quantum Optics (EQO) and exploits entanglement of the Cooper pairs of a BCS superconductor. The latter is coupled via an adjustable quantum point contact to two opposite spin polarized electron wave-guides, which are driven by trains of Lorentzian pulses. This specific choice for the drive is crucial to inject purely electronic entangled-states devoid of spurious electron-hole pairs. In the Andreev regime, a perturbative calculation in the tunnel coupling confirms that entangled electrons states (EES) are generated at the output of the normal side. We introduce a quantity related to charge current cross-correlations which allows one to verify experimentally the entangled nature of the emitted state.</description>

      <title>Scalable amplitude of Sondheimer oscillations in thin cadmium crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field with the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. This expression is in disagreement with what was predicted in semi-classical scenarios, which neglect Landau quantization. We argue that the classical/quantum crossover occurs at accessible magnetic fields for states whose Fermi wave-vector is almost parallel to the magnetic field. As a consequence, the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement give rise to oscillations with a periodicity identical to the semi-classical one. A rigorous theoretical account of our data is missing.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Lattice Manipulation with Electric Currents and Thermal Gradients in MnSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The skyrmion lattice (SkL) in MnSi was studied using small-angle neutron scattering and under the influence of a radial electric current in a Corbino geometry. In response to the applied current, the SkL undergoes an angular reorientation with respect to the MnSi crystal lattice. The reorientation is non-monotonic with increasing current, with the SkL rotating first in one direction and then the other. The SkL reorientation was studied at different sample locations and found to depend on the local current density as inferred from a finite element analysis. The non-monotonic response indicates the presence of two competing effects on the SkL, most likely due to the presence of both radial electric and thermal currents. Such a scenario is supported by micromagnetic simulations, which show how these effects can act constructively or destructively to drive the SkL rotation, depending on the direction of the electric current. In addition, the simulations also suggest how the direction of the skyrmion flow may affect the SkL orientation.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect in monolayer 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12010v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. This study proves the topological behavior of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha&lt;1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha&gt;1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Transfer entropy and flow of information in two-skyrmion system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.</description>

Abstract: As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $&gt;4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectrum of altermagnets beyond linear spin wave theory: Magnon-magnon interactions via time-dependent matrix product states vs. atomistic spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, as collective low-energy excitations of magnetic material, is computed from an effective quantum spin Hamiltonian but simplified via linearized Holstein-Primakoff transformations to describe noninteracting magnons. The dispersion produced by such linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is then plotted as ``sharp bands'' of infinitely long-lived quasiparticles. However, magnons are prone to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles -- such as electrons, phonons or other magnons -- which can lead to shifting (i.e., band renormalization) and broadening of ``sharp bands'' as the signature of finite quasiparticle lifetime. The magnon-magnon interactions can be particularly important in antiferromagnets (AFs), and, therefore, possibly in newly classified altermagnets sharing many features of collinear AFs. Here, we employ nonperturbative quantum many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to obtain magnon spectral function for RuO$_2$ altermagnet whose effective quantum spin Hamiltonian is put onto 4-leg cylinder. Its upper band is shifted away from upper ``sharp band'' of LSWT, as well as broadened, which is explained as the consequence of {\em hybridization} of the latter with three-magnon continuum. This implies that two-magnon Raman scattering spectra {\em cannot} be computed from LSWT bands, which offers a litmus test for the relevance of magnon-magnon interactions. Finally, we employ atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, based on classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, to obtain magnon spectrum at finite temperature and/or at a fraction of the cost of TDMPS calculations. Despite including magnon-magnon interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations {\em cannot} match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum, thereby signaling {\em nonclassical} effects harbored by AFs and altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <title>Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2&gt;0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.</description>

      <title>Cyclic solid-state quantum battery: Thermodynamic characterization and quantum hardware simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase-transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex, which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot-spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which give the sets of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot-spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>The Role of Superlattice Phonons in Charge Localization Across Quantum Dot Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding charge transport in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies is important for developing the next generation of solar cells and light-harvesting devices based on QD technology. One of the key factors that governs the transport in such systems is related to the hybridization between the QDs. Recent experiments have successfully synthesized QD molecules, arrays, and assemblies by directly fusing the QDs, with enhanced hybridization leading to high carrier mobilities and coherent band-like electronic transport. In this work, we theoretically investigate the electron transfer dynamics across a finite CdSe-CdS core-shell QD array, considering up to seven interconnected QDs in one dimension. We find that, even in the absence of structural and size disorder, electron transfer can become localized by the emergent low-frequency superlattice vibrational modes when the connecting neck between QDs is narrow. On the other hand, we also identify a regime where the same vibrational modes facilitate coherent electron transport when the connecting necks are wide. Overall, we elucidate the crucial effects of electronic and superlattice symmetries and their couplings when designing high-mobility devices based on QD superlattices.</description>

      <title>Observation of condensed moire exciton polaritons in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moire lattices attract significant attention in double-layer graphene and TMD layer heterostructures as well as in photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics that emerges within these structures. However, direct measurement of the moir\'e ground, excited states and Bloch bands in twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report strong coupling between excitons in CsPbBr3 microplates and moire photonic modes at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states and moire polariton bands. Phase locked moire zero (in-phase) states and moire pi (antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. The moire polariton distribution can be tuned into the shape of a parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another superimposed one fixed. In addition, moire polaritons in twisted 2D honeycomb lattices are also observed. Increasing the pumping density, we realize exciton polariton condensation in the moire potential sites of the 1D/2D twisted lattices with the coherence time of around 1.4 ps. Our work lays the foundation to study coherent moire polariton condensation in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <title>Revealing the phonon bottleneck limit in negatively charged CdS quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capture of photoexcited hot electrons in semiconductors before they lose their excess energy to cooling is a long-standing goal in photon energy conversion. Semiconductor nanocrystals have large electron energy spacings that are expected to slow down electron relaxation by phonon emission, but hot electrons in photoexcited nanocrystals nevertheless cool rapidly by energy transfer to holes. This makes the intrinsic phonon-bottleneck limited electron lifetime in nanocrystals elusive. We used a combination of theory and experiments to probe the hot electron dynamics of negatively charged Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in the absence of holes. Experiments found that these hot electrons cooled on a 100 ps timescale. Theoretical simulations predicted that pure phonon-bottleneck limited electron cooling occurs on a similar timescale. This similarity suggests that the experimental measurements reflect the upper limit on hot electron lifetimes in these CdS QDs and the lower limit on the rates of processes that can harvest those hot electrons.</description>

      <title>Deformation of Matrix Geometry via Landau Level Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The Landau models are practically useful tools to extract matrix geometries. The level projection method however cannot be applied straightforwardly to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels. We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived mechanically even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify basic properties of the deformed matrix geometries through a concrete analysis of the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models on expanding two-sphere and elongating ellipsoid. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behaviors quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. We also numerically investigate the differences between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid.</description>

      <title>Magnon Blockade with Skyrmion Qubit-Magnon Coupling in a Hybrid Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnon blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon for generating single-magnon state, which gradually becomes one of the candidates for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to generate the magnon blockade in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG micromagnet and a skyrmion. Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the skyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived, and the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified. Under the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter regimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field intensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced, effectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of high-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching. Furthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade, revealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional magnon blockade. This scheme provides a versatile all-magnetic platform for generating high purity single-magnon sources.</description>

      <title>Cascades in transport and optical conductivity of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>

Abstract: ABACUS (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC) is an open-source software for first-principles electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. It mainly features density functional theory (DFT) and is compatible with both plane-wave basis sets and numerical atomic orbital basis sets. ABACUS serves as a platform that facilitates the integration of various electronic structure methods, such as Kohn-Sham DFT, stochastic DFT, orbital-free DFT, and real-time time-dependent DFT, etc. In addition, with the aid of high-performance computing, ABACUS is designed to perform efficiently and provide massive amounts of first-principles data for generating general-purpose machine learning potentials, such as DPA models. Furthermore, ABACUS serves as an electronic structure platform that interfaces with several AI-assisted algorithms and packages, such as DeePKS-kit, DeePMD, DP-GEN, DeepH, DeePTB, etc.</description>
