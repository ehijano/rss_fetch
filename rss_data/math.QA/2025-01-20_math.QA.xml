      <title>2D HQFTs and Frobenius $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{V})$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homotopy Quantum Field Theories as variants of Topological Quantum Field Theories are described by functors from some cobordism category, enriched with homotopical data, to a symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{V}$. A new notion of HQFTs is introduced using target pairs of spaces $(X,Y)$ acounting for basepoints being sent to points in $Y$. Such $(X,Y)$-HQFTs are classified in dimension 1 by dualizable representations of $\mathcal{G}:=\Pi_1(X,Y)$, the relative fundamental groupoid. For dimension 2, the notion of crossed loop Frobenius $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{V})$-categories is introduced, generalizing crossed Frobenius $G$-algebras, where $G$ is only a group. After stating generalities of these multi-object generalizations, a classification theorem of 2-dimensional $(X,Y)$-HQFTs via crossed loop Frobenius $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{V})$-categories is proven.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space for GL_n or SL_n is a Coulomb branch, which confirms a conjecture of Bourget-Dancer-Grimminger-Hanany-Zhong. In particular, we show that the ring of functions on the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space of GL_n or SL_n is finitely generated.
  We prove this by showing that, if we are given a map $H \to G$ of complex reductive groups and a representation of $G$ satisfying an assumption we call gluable, then the Coulomb branch for the induced representation of $H$ is obtained from the corresponding Coulomb branch for $G$ by a certain Hamiltonian reduction procedure. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch associated to any quiver with no loops can be obtained from Coulomb branches associated to quivers with exactly two vertices using this procedure.</description>

      <title>The $q$-Racah polynomials from scalar products of Bethe states II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Leonard triples is applied to the derivation of normalized scalar products of on-shell and off-shell Bethe states generated from a Leonard pair. The scalar products take the form of linear combinations of $q$-Racah polynomials with coefficients depending on the off-shell parameters. Upon specializations, explicit solutions for the corresponding Belliard-Slavnov linear systems are obtained. It implies the existence of a determinant formula in terms of inhomogeneous Bethe roots for the $q$-Racah polynomials. Also, a set of relations that determines solutions (Bethe roots) of the corresponding Bethe equations of inhomogeneous type in terms of solutions of Bethe equations of homogenous type is obtained.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Jantzen filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a monoidal analogue of Jantzen filtrations in the framework of monoidal abelian categories with generic braidings. It leads to a deformation of the multiplication of the Grothendieck ring. We conjecture, and we prove in many remarkable situations, that this deformation is associative so that our construction yields a quantization of the Grothendieck ring as well as analogs of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. As a first main example, for finite-dimensional representations of simply-laced quantum loop algebras, we prove the associativity and we establish that the resulting quantization coincides with the quantum Grothendieck ring constructed by Nakajima and Varagnolo-Vasserot in a geometric manner. Hence, it yields a unified representation-theoretic interpretation of the quantum Grothendieck ring. As a second main example, we establish an analogous result for a monoidal category of finite-dimensional modules over symmetric quiver Hecke algebras categorifying the coordinate ring of a unipotent group associated with a Weyl group element. We obtain various applications, in particular on the homological structure of representations.</description>

      <title>Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks; constructible factorization algebras are algebras for the $\infty$-operad of embedded disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>
