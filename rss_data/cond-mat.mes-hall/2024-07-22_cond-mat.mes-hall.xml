      <title>Floquet $\pi$ Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new kind of exceptional points in periodically driven system, called Floquet $\pi$ exceptional points, whose eigenvectors rotate on Bloch sphere and accumulate $\pi$ geometric phase in one time period. The merging of two such kind exceptional points are constrained by their dynamical structure, meaning two order-1/2 exceptional points with same dynamical structure can merge to one order-1 one while those with opposite dynamical structure can not. We show they exist in Floquet bipartite lattices, and the order-1 Floquet $\pi$ exceptional points appear at the phase transition point between quasimomentum gap phases and quasienergy gap phases. The scattering properties around the order-1 Floquet $\pi$ exceptional points is quite novel, which is perfect transparency but detectable in reflection for one of two sides.</description>

      <title>Deriving friction force using fractional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The friction force is derived using fractional calculus by considering the non-uniform flow of time in dissipative processes. The approach incorporates inhomogeneous velocity without unphysical approximations, resulting in a Lagrangian where the order of fractional derivatives measures time intervals. The fractional term in the Lagrangian provides correct Euler-Lagrange, and ultimately, the Hamilton equations, and vanishes during energy change measurements, like a ghost.</description>

      <title>Energy efficient coherent quantum control of nitrogen vacancy (NV) spin with nanoscale magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate coherent quantum control of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond with microwave fields generated from a nanoscale magnet that is proximal to the NV center. Our results show remarkable coherent control with high contrast Rabi oscillations using nearfield microwaves from shape anisotropic nanomagnets of lateral dimensions down to 200 nm x 180 nm, driven remotely by surface acoustic wave (SAW) excitation that is at least 400 times and potentially 4 orders of magnitude more energy efficient than generating microwaves with an antenna. Furthermore, we show that varying the acoustic power driving such nanomagnets can achieve control over Rabi frequency. We also report spin-lattice relaxation time T1 is 103 +/-0.5 micro-seconds, the spin-spin relaxation time T2 is 1.23+/-0.29 micro-seconds, and the Ramsey coherence time T2* is 218+/-27 nanoseconds measured using microwave pulses generated by such nanomagnets. The use of the nanoscale magnets to implement highly localized and energy efficient coherent quantum control can replace thermally noisy microwave circuits and demonstrate a path to scalable quantum computing and sensing with NV-defects in diamond and other spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Giant gate-controlled room temperature odd-parity magnetoresistance in magnetized bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotransport measurements are crucial for understanding the Fermi surface properties, magnetism, and topology in quantum materials. Here, we report the discovery of giant room temperature odd-parity magnetoresistance (OMR) in a bilayer graphene (BLG) heterostructure interfaced with Cr$_2$Te$_2$Ge$_6$ (CGT). Using magnetotransport measurements, we demonstrate that the BLG/CGT heterostructure exhibits a significant antisymmetric longitudinal magnetoresistance, indicative of intrinsic time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in the system. We show that the OMR is tunable via electrostatic gating. Additionally, the OMR is pronounced near the band edges and diminishes with increasing charge carrier density in graphene. Our theoretical analysis reveals that this phenomenon arises from the coupling of the out-of-plane components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment to the applied magnetic field in a TRS-broken system. Our findings establish OMR as a significant probe for TRS breaking in quantum materials in which the crystal symmetries preclude the appearance of anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Tuning magnetic exchange interactions in 2D magnets: the case of CrGeX$_3$ (X = Se, Te) and Janus Cr$_2$Ge$_2$(Se,Te)$_3$ monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational study to explore the potential of different experimental approaches to tune the magnetic interactions in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets. We selected CrGeSe$_3$, CrGeTe$_3$, and Janus Cr$_2$Ge$_2$(Se,Te)$_3$ monolayers as case studies and calculated the full exchange tensors among all relevant atomic pairs and analyze their dependence on different external parameters, such as biaxial and uniaxial strain, as well as gate voltage. We pay special attention to interactions that emerge or vanish due to changes of the symmetry of the system. We find that biaxial and uniaxial strains significantly modify isotropic exchange couplings, which can lead to a transition from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic phase, while a gate voltage induces Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, forming a vortex pattern whose chirality is determined by the sign of the electric field. The electric dipole moment of the Janus material is large, raising the possibility of multiferroic behaviour. The polarizability is similar for the three compounds.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of thermal and bipolar thermoelectric diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the minimal requirements that induce a nonreciprocal response to temperature differences in a quantum electronic conductor. We identify two distinct mechanisms due electron-electron interactions, namely inelastic scattering and screening, to locally affect the internal temperature and potential of the device, leading to thermal and thermoelectric rectification effects in the presence of an inversion symmetry breaking. We propose resonant tunneling samples to efficiently exploit these effects, and find configurations acting as bipolar thermoelectric diodes whose current flows in the same direction irrespective of the sign of the temperature difference, either due to thermalization or to screening controlled quantum interference.</description>

      <title>Landscapes of an out-of-equilibrium anyonic sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy dynamics of two-dimensional topological matter hinges on its one-dimensional edge modes. Tunneling between fractional quantum Hall edge modes facilitates the study of anyonic statistics: it induces time-domain braiding that dominates signals from diluted anyon beams. We develop a framework for characterizing out-of-equilibrium anyonic states and define their effective potential and temperature, as well as the landscape of their excitations. Unlike fermions, the effective anyon potential depends on the type of the tunneling quasiparticles; non-equilibrium anyonic states are underlain by power-law energy distributions. This allows "hot" anyons to tunnel above the chemical potential of the source, which we capture by a measurable universal witness function.</description>

      <title>Tunneling current and current correlations for anyonic quasiparticles of {\nu} = 1/2 chiral Luttinger liquid in multi-edge geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider anyonic quasiparticles with charge e/2 described by the {\nu} = 1/2 chiral Luttinger liquid, which collide in a Hong-Ou-Mandel-like interferometer. These colliding anyonic channels can be formally viewed as hosting Laughlin-like fractional {\nu} = 1/2 quasiparticles. More specifically, two possible geometries are considered: (i) a two-edge-channel setup where anyons originate from equilibrium reservoirs; (ii) a four-edge-channel setup where nonequilibrium anyons arrive at the collider in the form of diluted beams. For both setups, we calculate the tunneling current and the current correlations. For setup (i), our results provide analytically exact expressions for the tunneling current, tunneling-current noise, and cross-correlation noise, The exact relation between conductance and noise is demonstrated. For setup (ii), we show that the tunneling current and the generalized Fano factor [defined in B. Rosenow et al. (2016)] are finite for diluted streams of {\nu} = 1/2 anyons. This is due to the processes where nonequilibrium anyons, supplied via either source edge, directly tunnel at the central QPC. Thus, to obtain meaningful results in this case, one should go beyond the so-called time-domain braiding processes, where nonequilibrium anyons do not tunnel at the collider, but rather indirectly influence the tunneling by braiding with the quasiparticle-quasihole pairs created at the collider. This suggests that the effect of direct tunneling and collisions of diluted anyons in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer can be important for various observables in physical quantum-Hall edges at Laughlin filling fractions.</description>

      <title>Floquet interferometry of a dressed semiconductor quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum system interacting with a time-periodic excitation creates a ladder of hybrid eigenstates in which the system is mixed with an increasing number of photons. This mechanism, referred to as dressing, has been observed in the context of light-matter interaction in systems as varied as atoms, molecules and solid-state qubits. In this work, we demonstrate state dressing in a semiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir. We observe the emergence of a Floquet ladder of states in the system's high-frequency electrical response, manifesting as interference fringes at the multiphoton resonances despite the system lacking an avoided crossing. We study the dressed quantum dot while changing reservoir temperature, charge lifetime, and excitation amplitude and reveal the fundamental nature of the mechanism by developing a theory based on the quantum dynamics of the Floquet ladder, which is in excellent agreement with the data. Furthermore, we show how the technique finds applications in the accurate electrostatic characterisation of semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport in a graphite cylinder under quantizing fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the transport properties of curved, three-dimensional graphite samples in strong magnetic fields. Focusing on a millimeter-scale graphite cylinder as a prototypical curved object, we perform longitudinal and Hall voltage measurements while applying quantizing magnetic fields. These measurements are investigated as a function of field strength and angles. Most importantly, we find that angle-dependent Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations are superimposed with angle-independent features. Reproducing the experimental observations, we introduce a network model that accounts for the cylindrical geometry effect by conceptualizing the cylinder as composed of strips of planar graphite in an effectively inhomogeneous magnetic field. Our work highlights how the interplay between geometric curvature and quantizing magnetic fields can be leveraged to engineer tunable spatial current densities within solid-state systems, and paves the way for understanding transport properties of curved and bent three-dimensional samples more generally.</description>

      <title>Material transfer and contact optimization in MoS2 nanotube devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the promise of clean and defect-free $\textrm{MoS}_{2}$ nanotubes as quantum electronic devices is obvious, ranging from strong spin-orbit interaction to intrinsic superconductivity, device fabrication still poses considerable challenges. Deterministic transfer of transition metal dichalcogenide nanomaterials and transparent contacts to the nanomaterials are nowadays highly active topics of research, both with fundamental research and applications in mind. Contamination from transport agents as well as surface adsorbates and surface charges play a critical role for device performance. Many techniques have been proposed to address these topics for transition metal dichalcogenides in general. Here, we analyse their usage for the transfer based fabrication of $\textrm{MoS}_{2}$ nanotube devices. Further, we compare different contact materials in order to avoid the formation of a Schottky barrier.</description>

      <title>A quasiparticle-injection superconducting microwave relaxation oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting microwave relaxation oscillator based on a nanowire shunted by a resistor and an inductor controlled by quasiparticle injection from a tunnel junction positioned on it: the QUISTRON. This device exhibits relaxation oscillator behavior with DC voltage-controlled frequency tuning and DC current bias. The device frequency is modulated via the tunnel junction, which induces localized heating by injecting quasiparticles. This heating mechanism modulates the nanowire switching current, enabling relaxation oscillations when it falls below the bias current. We demonstrate the device operating principles and characterize its performance across various parameters, including different choices of shunt resistor, shunt inductance, and bath temperature ranging from 20 mK to 1 K. The device showed oscillation with a frequency range approximately between 1 GHz and 10 GHz and total energy dissipation per cycle of $\sim100$ zJ. Our results suggest that this design offers a promising platform for compact, tunable superconducting oscillators in the microwave spectrum with potential applications in quantum information processing, microwave technology, and ultra-low-power electronics. The straightforward frequency control mechanism and integration potential make this device an attractive candidate for superconducting microwave local oscillators.</description>

      <title>The 1D photonic wire as a single-photon source: Implications of cQED to a phonon bath of reduced dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the semiconductor quantum dot placed in a solid-state material allows for deterministic emission of single photons, the photon indistinguishability is strongly influenced by the intrinsic coupling to lattice vibrations, phonons, of the solid-state environment. This work investigates the phonon-induced decoherence for a quantum dot placed in the one-dimensional system of a homogeneous cylindrical nanowire. Such a structure supports multiple longitudinal phonon branches, and we consider both a linear and a quadratic coupling of the emitter to these modes. Under a polaron approach, we initially derive an analytical expression for the 1D pure dephasing rate, which leads to a reduced pure dephasing rate compared with bulk. By implementing these results into a full cavity quantum electrodynamic model, we demonstrate that multimode coupling is necessary to correctly predict the indistinguishability in a 1D system, which may otherwise be significantly underestimated.</description>

      <title>Experimental Determination of Wannier Centers in 1D topological chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hallmark of topological crystalline insulators is the emergence of a robust electronic state in a bandgap localized at the boundary of the material. However, end, edge, and surface states can also have a non-topological origin. Unfortunately, topological invariants such as the winding number and Zak-phase are often not directly experimentally accessible for solids. In addition to topological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provide a fingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a method to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in artificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states. We determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains, topological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding simulations.</description>

      <title>Observation of paramagnetic spin-degeneracy lifting in EuZn2Sb2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taken together, time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries impose a two-fold spin degeneracy of the electronic states in crystals. In centrosymmetric materials, this degeneracy can be lifted by introducing magnetism, either via an externally applied field or through internal magnetization. However, a correlated alignment of spins, even in the paramagnetic phase, can lift the spin degeneracy of electronic states. Here, we report an in-depth study of the electronic band structure of the Eu-ternary pnictide EuZn2Sb2 through a combination of high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and first principles calculations. An analysis of the photoemission lineshapes over a range of incident photon energies and sample temperatures is shown to reveal the presence of band spin degeneracy-lifting in the paramagnetic phase. Our ARPES results are in good agreement with theoretical ferromagnetic-phase calculations, which indicates the importance of ferromagnetic fluctuations in the system. Through our calculations, we predict that spin-polarized bands in EuZn2Sb2 generate a single pair of Weyl nodes. Our observation of band-splitting in EuZn2Sb2 provides a key step toward realizing time-reversal symmetry breaking physics in the absence of long-range magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Excitation laser energy dependence of the gap-mode TERS spectra of WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ on silver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the dependence of gap mode tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of mono- and bi-layer WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ as a function of excitation laser energy. We collected consecutive TERS maps of mono-and bi-layer regions with 6 different excitation lasers. To decrease the acquisition time, we used for the first time concurrent excitation and collection with two lasers simultaneously. We found that the E$_{2g}$/A$_{1g}$ peak intensity ratio for bilayer WS$_2$@Ag and the A'/A$_{1g}$ peak intensity ratio of the out-of-plane modes for mono- and bilayer change in a significantly non-monotonous way with excitation laser energies from 1.58 to 2.62 eV. The former ratio increases at energies corresponding to A and B excitons in bilayer WS$_2$. The intensity of the A peak in the monolayer, and hence the A/A$_{1g}$ ratio, is surprisingly high at low excitation energies, dips dramatically at energy corresponding to the A exciton, and is restored partially in between A and B excitons, though still showing a descending trend with increasing energy. A similar picture was observed in mono- and bi-layer MoS$_2$, though the existing set of lasers did not match its excitonic profile as nicely as for WS$_2$. We attribute the observed behavior to intermediate (Fano resonance) or strong (Rabi splitting) coupling between the excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and the plasmons in the tip-substrate nanocavity. This is akin to the so-called Fano (Rabi) transparency experimentally observed in far field scattering from TMDs between two plasmonic metals. The possibility of intermediate/strong coupling between excitonic resonances in TMDs and the nanocavity re-evaluates the role of resonances in gap-mode TERS and should become an important factor to be considered by TERS practitioners when planning experiments. Finally, we propose the ideal substrate for efficient TERS and tip enhanced photoluminescence measurements.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance Parametric Converter</title>

Abstract: Parametric converters are parametric amplifiers that mix two spatially separate nondegenerate modes and are commonly used for amplifying and squeezing microwave signals in quantum computing and sensing. In Josephson parametric converters, the strong localized nonlinearity of the Josephson Junction limits the amplification and squeezing, as well as the dynamic range, in current devices. In contrast, a weak distributed nonlinearity can provide higher gain and dynamic range, when implemented as a kinetic inductance (KI) nanowire of a dirty superconductor, and has additional benefits such as resilience to magnetic field, higher-temperature operation, and simplified fabrication. Here, we propose, demonstrate, and analyze the performance of a KI parametric converter that relies on the weak distributed nonlinearity of a KI nanowire. The device utilizes three-wave mixing induced by a DC current bias. We demonstrate its operation as a nondegenerate parametric amplifier with high phase-sensitive gain, reaching two-mode amplification and deamplification of $\sim$30 dB for two resonances separated by 0.8 GHz, in excellent agreement with our theory of the device. We observe a dynamic range of -108~dBm at 30 dB gain. Our device can significantly broaden applications of quantum-limited signal processing devices including phase-preserving amplification and two-mode squeezing.</description>

      <title>Electrical pumping of h-BN single-photon sources in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond, silicon carbide, and zinc oxide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we conceive and realize a novel device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon sources using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allows persistent and repeatable generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect complexes of h-BN crystal. Our work facilitates implementing efficient and miniaturized single-photon devices in van der Waals platforms toward applications in quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>On the Edge Roughness of Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the roughness of mechanically cleaved edges in 2D crystals and glasses using molecular dynamics simulations with chemically accurate machine-learning force fields. Our results show that ultra-flat armchair and zigzag edges can be achieved in graphene by aligning the loading direction with specific lattice orientations. Deviations from these orientations create kinks between the atomically smooth armchair and zigzag segments, with increased irregularities when dynamic effects are considered. Fracture mechanics analysis highlights the kinetic and dynamic factors contributing to crack deflection and edge roughening. In three-atom-thick 2D silica crystals, the relationship between edge morphologies and cleavage conditions is modified by their bilayer structure and sublattice asymmetry. In 2D silica glasses, this correlation is further disrupted by topological disorder. These insights are crucial for minimizing edge roughness in 2D materials, which is essential for their performance in mechanical and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Role of Quantum Coherence in Kinetic Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kinetic Uncertainty Relation (KUR) bounds the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic currents in terms of the number of transitions per unit time, known as the dynamical activity. This bound was derived in a classical context, and can be violated in the quantum regime due to coherent effects. However, the precise connection between KUR violations and quantum coherence has so far remained elusive, despite significant investigation. In this work, we solve this problem by deriving a modified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when, coherence might lead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific kind of unraveling of the quantum master equation. It therefore allows one to compare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in each case, how quantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate our result on a double quantum dot, where the electron current is monitored either by electron jump detection or with continuous diffusive charge measurement.</description>

      <title>Current-Crowding-Free Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting single photons is essential for applications such as dark matter detection, quantum science and technology, and biomedical imaging. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, sub-Hz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the straight segments of SNSPDs with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current-crowding-free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: after irradiation with 800 ions/nm$\unicode{xB2}$, locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37% while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% for a wavelength of 780 nm with a dark count rate of 7 mHz near the onset of saturating detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of Defects and Related Electric Properties in He-Irradiated YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin films of the superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) were modified by low-energy light-ion irradiation employing collimated or focused He$^+$ beams, and the long-term stability of irradiation-induced defects was investigated. For films irradiated with collimated beams, the resistance was measured in situ during and after irradiation and analyzed using a phenomenological model. The formation and stability of irradiation-induced defects are highly influenced by temperature. Thermal annealing experiments conducted in an Ar atmosphere at various temperatures demonstrated a decrease in resistivity and allowed us to determine diffusion coefficients and the activation energy $\Delta E = (0.31 \pm 0.03)$ eV for diffusive oxygen rearrangement within the YBCO unit cell basal plane. Additionally, thin YBCO films, nanostructured by focused He$^+$-beam irradiation into vortex pinning arrays, displayed significant commensurability effects in magnetic fields. Despite the strong modulation of defect densities in these pinning arrays, oxygen diffusion during room-temperature annealing over almost six years did not compromise the signatures of vortex matching, which remained precisely at their magnetic fields predicted by the pattern geometry. Moreover, the critical current increased substantially within the entire magnetic field range after long-term storage in dry air. These findings underscore the potential of ion irradiation in tailoring the superconducting properties of thin YBCO films.</description>

      <title>Algebraic localization of generalized Wannier bases implies Roe triviality in any dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of understanding the localization topology correspondence for non periodic gapped quantum systems, we investigate the relation between the existence of an algebraically well-localized generalized Wannier basis and the topological triviality of the corresponding projection operator. Inspired by the work of M. Ludewig and G.C. Thiang, we consider the triviality of a projection in the sense of coarse geometry, i.e. as triviality in the $K_0$-theory of the Roe $C^*$-algebra of $\mathrm{R}^d$. We obtain in Theorem 2.8 a threshold, depending on the dimension, for the decay rate of the generalized Wannier functions which implies topological triviality in Roe sense. This threshold reduces, for $d = 2$, to the almost optimal threshold appearing in the Localization Dichotomy Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Fate of transient order parameter domain walls in ultrafast experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments, an optical pump pulse often generates transient domain walls of the order parameter in materials with spontaneous symmetry breaking, due to either a finite penetration depth of the light on a three-dimensional (3D) material, or a finite spot size on a two-dimensional (2D) material. We clarify the decaying process of such a domain wall that is caused by fluctuations of the order parameters. We study a generic system with $U(1)$-symmetric order, and those with an additional weak $Z_2$ ($U(1)$-symmetry-breaking) term, representing the charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in recent experiments. The decay process comprises two non-trivial stages. During the first stage, exponentially growing thermal fluctuations convert the domain wall into an interface with randomly distributed topological defects. In the second stage, the topological defects undergo a coarsening dynamics within the interface. For a 2D interface in the 3D system, the coarsening dynamics leads to a diffusive growth of the correlation length. For a one-dimensional (1D) interface in the 2D system with the weak $Z_2$ term, the correlation-length growth shows a crossover from diffusive to sub-diffusive behavior. Our theory provides a fundamental physical picture for the dynamics of pump-induced domain walls in ultrafast experiments.</description>

      <title>Vibrations and damping of the eigenmodes of viscoelastic nanospheres with thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a series of exact analytical closed expressions to calculate the complex eigenfrequencies and the displacement for the corresponding eigenmodes of a viscoelastic (nano-)sphere in the presence of linear damping. Where possible, we provide closed expressions for damping rates, including the contributions from viscosity, as well as thermal conductivity and solutions of the heat equation. We assume an isolated system, such that no energy/heat transfer to the environment is allowed. We find monotonic behavior of the damping as a function of frequency for breathing and torsional modes, however, for spheroidal modes we find non-monotonicity. Furthermore, we analytically analyze the thermodynamic limit for all mode types. We also investigate the frequency shift and find expected behavior, i.e. a reduced eigenfrequency with damping than without damping for breathing and torsional modes. For spheroidal modes, however, we find non-monotonic shifts, corresponding to the damping. For some eigenfrequencies we find anomalous frequency shifts.</description>

      <title>Impurity flat band states in the diamond chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat band (FB) systems, i.e., models hosting dispersionless bands in their energy spectrum, have attracted great interest recently. The eigenstates of these FBs can be written as compact localized states (CLSs), meaning states having finite support only over a small, non-extensive portion of the lattice. When adjacent CLSs of a FB have spatial overlap, the subspace they span is, in general, non-orthogonal. Here, we consider precisely this scenario, in the form of a diamond chain with a finite magnetic flux per plaquette, which has a gapped midspectrum FB. After developing the general framework for projecting arbitrary operators onto a non-orthogonal subspace, we address the case of an open chain with small local impurities in the midchain plaquette. The framework is then applied to derive analytical expressions for the states of the FB affected by the impurities. The results are illustrated for three representative cases: two equal impurities, two symmetric impurities, and a single impurity. We also address the effects of diagonal disorder on the impurity states. Focusing on the equal impurities case, we show how these states effectively feel an averaged disorder determined by their spatial extension, which can be controlled by the flux. Due to this averaging effect, these states exhibit enhanced robustness to disorder. For the single-impurity case, we further reveal its exotic non-trivial topological phase, without precedent in the literature on Hermitian models, characterized by a half-integer winding number. By mapping the system onto an equivalent two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding lattice decorated with a central impurity line, the half-integer bulk invariants are shown to have a correspondence with the appearance of a single in-gap edge state when open boundary conditions (OBC) are imposed. Numerical simulations are performed to benchmark all analytical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light drives offer a potential tool for the dynamical control of magnetic interactions in matter. We theoretically investigate the indirect exchange coupling between two parallel chains of magnetic impurities on the surface of a topological insulator, driven by a time-periodic circularly polarized light field in the high-frequency, off-resonant regime. We derive a closed-form analytic expression for the spin susceptibility of the photon-dressed topological insulator surface states and obtain the irradiation dependence of the Ising, Heisenberg, and Dzyaloshinskii- Moriya exchange couplings between the impurity chains. Our results show a two-pronged modification of these exchange couplings by periodic drives. First, the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) oscillation period of the exchange couplings can be extended by enhancing the driving strength. Second, increasing driving strength enhances the envelope of RKKY oscillations of the Ising type while suppressing those of the Heisenberg type and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type. Our work provides useful insights for realizing Floquet engineering of collinear and noncollinear indirect exchange interactions in topological insulating systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the domain wall network in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) under the influence of interlayer bias and screening effect from the layered structure. Starting from the continuum model, we analyze the low-energy domain wall modes within the moir\'e bilayer structure and obtain an analytic form representing charge density distributions of the two-dimensional structure. By computing the screened electron-electron interaction strengths both within and between the domain walls, we develop a bosonized model that describes the correlated domain wall network. We demonstrate that these interaction strengths can be modified through an applied interlayer bias, screening length and dielectric materials, and show how the model can be employed to investigate various properties of the domain wall network and its stability. We compute correlation functions both without and with phonons. Including electron-phonon coupling in the network, we establish phase diagrams from these correlation functions. These diagrams illustrate electrical tunability of the network between various phases, such as density wave states and superconductivity. Our findings reveal the domain wall network as a promising platform for the experimental manipulation of electron-electron interactions in low dimensions and the study of strongly correlated matter. We point out that our investigation not only enhances the understanding of domain wall modes in TBG but also has broader implications for the development of moir\'e devices.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the nature of the photoexcitation and ultrafast charge dynamics pathways in organic halide perovskite nanocubes and their aggregation into superlattices is key for the potential applications as tunable light emitters, photon harvesting materials and light-amplification systems. In this work, we apply two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to track in real time the formation of near-infrared optical excitons and their ultrafast relaxation in CH(NH2)2PbI3 nanocube superlattices. Our results unveil that the coherent ultrafast dynamics is limited by the combination of the inherent short exciton decay time ~40 fs and the dephasing due to the coupling with selective optical phonon modes at higher temperatures. On the picosecond timescale, we observe the progressive formation of long-lived localized trap states. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the excitonic intrinsic linewidth, as extracted by the anti-diagonal components of the 2D spectra, unveils a dramatic change of the excitonic coherence time across the cubic to tetragonal structural transition. Our results offer a new way to control and enhance the ultrafast coherent dynamics of photocarrier generation in hybrid halide perovskite synthetic solids.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in a ballistic single-channel nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When time-reversal and inversion symmetry are broken, superconducting circuits may exhibit a so-called diode effect, where the critical currents for opposite directions of the current flow differ. In recent years, this effect has been observed in a multitude of systems and the different physical ingredients that may yield such an effect are well understood. On a microscopic level, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and a Zeeman field may give rise to a diode effect in a single Josephson junction. However, so far there is no analytical description of the effect within a simple model. Here we study a single channel nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in the presence of a Zeeman field. We show that the different Fermi velocities and spin projections of the two pseudo-spin bands lead to a diode effect. Simple analytical expressions for the diode efficiency can be obtained in limiting cases.</description>

Abstract: The Klein bottle Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) insulator phase plays a pivotal role in understanding higher-order topological phases. The insulator phase is characterized by a unique feature: a nonsymmorphic glide symmetry that exists within momentum space, rather than real space. This characteristic transforms the Brillouin zone's fundamental domain into a structure of Klein bottle. Here, we report an observation of a Klein bottle topoelectrical model under gauge fields. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the different corner distributions of odd and even unit cells, we present theoretical calculations and demonstrate that the symmetry properties significantly affect the topological nature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental results, which demonstrate the practical feasibility of such topological configurations in electronic circuits. Our work establishes a vital connection between the realms of condensed matter physics and circuit systems, thereby paving a pathway for investigating exotic condensed matter physics.</description>

Abstract: We perform readout of a quantum-dot hybrid qubit coupled to a superconducting resonator through a parametric, longitudinal interaction mechanism. Our experiments are performed with the qubit and resonator frequencies detuned by $\sim$10 GHz, demonstrating that longitudinal coupling can facilitate semiconductor qubit operation in the 'ultra-dispersive' regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent through a single transverse mode in nanowire Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials are fueling research in mesoscopic physics and quantum technology. Recently demonstrated smooth $\beta$-Sn superconductor shells, due to the increased induced gap, are expanding the available parameter space to new regimes. Fabricated on quasiballistic InSb nanowires, with careful control over the hybrid interface, Sn shells yield measurable switching currents even when nanowire resistance is of order 10kohm. In this regime Cooper pairs travel through a purely 1D quantum wire for at least part of their trajectory. Here, we focus on the evolution of proximity-induced supercurrent in magnetic field parallel to the nanowire. Long decay up to fields of 1T is observed. At the same time, the decay for higher occupied subbands is notably faster in some devices but not in others. We analyze this using a tight-binding numerical model that includes the Zeeman, orbital and spin-orbit effects. When the first subband is spin polarized, we observe a dramatic suppression of supercurrent, which is also confirmed by the model and suggests an absence of significant triplet supercurrent generation.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene in the moir\'eless limit and in Coulomb imprinted superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard theoretical framework for fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAH) assumes an isolated flat Chern band in the single particle level. In this paper we challenges this paradigm for the FQAH recently observed in the pentalayer rhombohedral stacked graphene aligned with hexagon boron nitride (hBN). We show that the external moir\'e superlattice potential is simply a perturbation in a model with continuous translation symmetry. Through Hartree Fock calculation, we find that interaction opens a sizable remote band gap, resulting an isolated narrow $C=1$ Chern band at filling $\nu=1$. From exact diagonalization (ED) we identify FQAH phases at various fillings. But they exist also in the calculations without any external moir\'e potential. We suggest that the QAH insulator at $\nu=1$ should be viewed as an interaction driven topological Wigner crystal with QAH effect, which is then pinned by a small moir\'e potential. The $C=1$ QAH crystal is robust with a crystal period around $10\mathrm{nm}$ in 4-layer, 5-layer, 6-layer and 7-layer graphene systems. Our work suggests a new direction to exploring the interplay of topology and FQAH with spontaneous crystal formation in the vanishing moir\'e potential limit. We also propose a new system to generate and control both honeycomb and triangular moir\'e superlattice potential through Coulomb interaction from another control layer, which can stabilize or suppress the QAH crystal depending on the density of the control layer.</description>

      <title>Interferometry of non-Abelian band singularities and Euler class topology</title>

Abstract: In systems with a real Bloch Hamiltonian band nodes can be characterised by a non-Abelian frame-rotation charge. The ability of these band nodes to annihilate pairwise is path dependent, since by braiding nodes in adjacent gaps the sign of their charges can be changed. Here, we theoretically construct and numerically confirm two concrete methods to experimentally probe these non-Abelian braiding processes and charges in ultracold atomic systems. We consider a coherent superposition of two bands that can be created by moving atoms through the band singularities at some angle in momentum space. Analyzing the dependency of excitations on the frame charges, we demonstrate an interferometry scheme passing through two band nodes, which reveals the relative frame charges and allows for measuring the multi-gap topological invariant. The second method relies on a single wavepacket probing two nodes sequentially, where the frame charges can be determined from the band populations. Our results present a feasible avenue for measuring non-Abelian charges of band nodes and the direct experimental verification of braiding procedures, which can be applied in a variety of settings including the recently discovered anomalous non-Abelian phases arising under periodic driving.</description>

Abstract: The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</description>
