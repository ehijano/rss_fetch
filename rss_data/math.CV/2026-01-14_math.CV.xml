      <title>Geometric subfamily of locally univalent functions, Blaschke products and quasidisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07842v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the family $\mathcal{F}(\alpha)$ defined for $\alpha \in (0, 3]$ by
  \begin{align*}
  {\rm Re}\left(1+\frac{zf''(z)}{f'(z)}\right) &gt; 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2} \quad \text{for } z \in \mathbb{D}.
  \end{align*}
  Our primary objective is to show that this family possesses significant geometric and analytic properties, including connections with Blaschke products and the Schwarzian derivative, as well as its sharp bounds. Furthermore, we prove that if $f \in \mathcal{F}(\alpha)$, then the image $f(\mathbb{D})$ is a quasidisk. We also show that if $f \in \mathcal{F}(\alpha)$, then $\|S_f\| = 2\alpha(2-\alpha)$. Moreover, we establish the sharp estimate $\|P_{f}\| \leq 2\alpha+1$ for the pre-Schwarzian derivative of harmonic mappings $f = h + \bar{g} \in \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{H}}(\alpha)$, where the analytic part $h$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}(\alpha)$.</description>

      <title>On octonionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation and pluripotential theory associated to octonionic plurisubharmonic functions of two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several aspects of pluripotential theory are generalized to octonionic plurisubharmonic (OPSH) functions of two variables. We prove the comparison principle for continuous OPSH functions and the quasicontinuity of locally bounded ones. An important tool is a formula of integration by parts for mixed octonionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator. Various useful properties of octonionic relative extremal functions and octonionic capacity are established. The main difficulty is the non-associativity of octonions. However, some weak form of associativity can be used to covercome this difficulty. Another important ingredient in pluripotential theory is the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous octonionic Monge-Amp\`ere equation on the unit ball, for which we show the $C_{loc}^{1,1}$-regularity by applying Bedford-Taylor's method. The obstacle to do so is that an OPSH function is usually not OPSH under automorphisms of the unit ball. This issue can be solved by finding a weighted transformation formula of OPSH functions.</description>

      <title>Examples of critically cyclic functions in the Dirichlet spaces of the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct examples of holomorphic functions in $D_2(\B_2)$, the Dirichlet space on $\B_2$, for which there exists an index $\alpha_c \in [\frac12,2]$ such that the function is cyclic in $D_\alpha(\B_2)$ if and only if $\alpha \leq \alpha_c$. To this end, we use the notion of \emph{interpolation sets} in smooth ball algebras, as studied by Bruna, Ortega, Chaumat, and Chollet.</description>

      <title>A complex analytic approach to orbifold Chern classes on singular varieties and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the orbifold version of the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for stable $\mathbb Q$-sheaves on K\"ahler varieties, generalizing our earlier work \cite{GP25} in dimension three. We also provide a characterization of the equality case, a new purely analytical proof of the numerical characterization of complex torus quotients as well as a novel, complex analytic interpretation of the second orbifold Chern class associated to a $\mathbb Q$-sheaf.</description>

      <title>Birational Geometry of Special Quotient Foliations and Chazy's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The works of Brunella and Santos have singled out three special singular holomorphic foliations on projective surfaces having invariant rational nodal curves of positive self-intersection. These foliations can be described as quotients of foliations on some rational surfaces under cyclic groups of transformations of orders three, four, and six, respectively. Through an unexpected connection with the reduced Chazy IV, V and VI equations, we give explicit models for these foliations as degree-two foliations on the projective plane (in particular, we recover Pereira's model of Brunella's foliation). We describe the full groups of birational automorphisms of these quotient foliations, and, through this, produce symmetries for the reduced Chazy IV and V equations. We give another model for Brunella's very special foliation, one with only non-degenerate singularities, for which its characterizing involution is a quartic de Jonqui\`eres one, and for which its order-three symmetries are linear. Lastly, our analysis of the action of monomial transformations on linear foliations poses naturally the question of determining planar models for their quotients under the action of the standard quadratic Cremona involution; we give explicit formulas for these as well.</description>

      <title>Weighted cscK metric (II): the continuity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of metrics with weighted constant scalar curvature (wcscK for short) on a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$: this notion include constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics, weighted solitons, Calabi's extremal K\"ahler metrics and extremal metric on semisimple principal fibrations. We prove that the coercivity of the weighted Mabuchi functional implies the existence of a wcscK metric, thereby achieving the equivalence. \\ We then give several applications in K\"ahler and toric geometry, such as a weighted version of the toric Yau-Tian-Donaldson correspondence, and the characterization of the existence of wcscK metric on total space of semisimple principal fibration $Y$ in term of existence of wcscK metric on its fiber $X$.</description>
