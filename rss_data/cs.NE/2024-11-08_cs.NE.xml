      <title>Finding Strong Lottery Ticket Networks with Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, every sufficiently large neural network with randomly initialized weights contains a sub-network which - still with its random weights - already performs as well for a given task as the trained super-network. We present the first approach based on a genetic algorithm to find such strong lottery ticket sub-networks without training or otherwise computing any gradient. We show that, for smaller instances of binary classification tasks, our evolutionary approach even produces smaller and better-performing lottery ticket networks than the state-of-the-art approach using gradient information.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Detection of Relevant Objectives and Adaptation to Preference Drifts in Interactive Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms (EMOAs) are widely employed to tackle problems with multiple conflicting objectives. Recent research indicates that not all objectives are equally important to the decision-maker (DM). In the context of interactive EMOAs, preference information elicited from the DM during the optimization process can be leveraged to identify and discard irrelevant objectives, a crucial step when objective evaluations are computationally expensive. However, much of the existing literature fails to account for the dynamic nature of DM preferences, which can evolve throughout the decision-making process and affect the relevance of objectives. This study addresses this limitation by simulating dynamic shifts in DM preferences within a ranking-based interactive algorithm. Additionally, we propose methods to discard outdated or conflicting preferences when such shifts occur. Building on prior research, we also introduce a mechanism to safeguard relevant objectives that may become trapped in local or global optima due to the diminished correlation with the DM-provided rankings. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively manage evolving preferences and significantly enhance the quality and desirability of the solutions produced by the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Wireless Split Computing with Multi-Level Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biological processes, neuromorphic computing utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform inference tasks, offering significant efficiency gains for workloads involving sequential data. Recent advances in hardware and software have demonstrated that embedding a few bits of payload in each spike exchanged between the spiking neurons can further enhance inference accuracy. In a split computing architecture, where the SNN is divided across two separate devices, the device storing the first layers must share information about the spikes generated by the local output neurons with the other device. Consequently, the advantages of multi-level spikes must be balanced against the challenges of transmitting additional bits between the two devices.
  This paper addresses these challenges by investigating a wireless neuromorphic split computing architecture employing multi-level SNNs. For this system, we present the design of digital and analog modulation schemes optimized for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface. Simulation and experimental results using software-defined radios provide insights into the performance gains of multi-level SNN models and the optimal payload size as a function of the quality of the connection between a transmitter and receiver.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Gradient-Based Simulations for Multi-Objective Optimization in Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle accelerator operation requires simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is particularly challenging due to trade-offs between the objectives. Evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), have been leveraged for many optimization problems, however, they do not apply to complex control problems by design. This paper demonstrates the power of differentiability for solving MOO problems using a Deep Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) algorithm in particle accelerators. We compare DDRL algorithm with Model Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), GA and Bayesian Optimization (BO) for simultaneous optimization of heat load and trip rates in the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). The underlying problem enforces strict constraints on both individual states and actions as well as cumulative (global) constraint for energy requirements of the beam. A physics-based surrogate model based on real data is developed. This surrogate model is differentiable and allows back-propagation of gradients. The results are evaluated in the form of a Pareto-front for two objectives. We show that the DDRL outperforms MFRL, BO, and GA on high dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Visuospatial navigation without distance, prediction, or maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13535</link>

Abstract: Navigation is controlled by at least two partially dissociable, concurrently developed systems in the brain. The cognitive map informs an organism of its location, bearing, and distances between environmental features, enabling shortcuts. Response-based navigation, on the other hand, the process of combining percept-action pairs into routes, is regarded as inaccurate and inflexible, ultimately subserving map-based representation. As such, navigation models tend to assume the primacy of maps, top-down constructed via predictive control and distance perception, while neglecting response-based strategies. Here we show the sufficiency of a minimal feedforward framework in a classic visual navigation task. Our agents, directly translating visual perception to movement, navigate to a hidden goal in an open field, an environment often assumed to require a map-based representation. While visual distance enables direct trajectories to the goal, two distinct algorithms develop to robustly navigate using visual angles alone. Each of the three confers unique contextual tradeoffs as well as aligns with movement behavior observed in rodents, insects, fish, and sperm cells, suggesting the widespread significance of response-based strategies. We advocate further study of navigation from the bottom-up without assuming online access to computationally expensive top-down representations, which may better explain behavior under energetic or attentional constraints.</description>
