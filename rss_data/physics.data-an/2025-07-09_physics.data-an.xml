      <title>Phase Retrieval of Highly Strained Bragg Coherent Diffraction Patterns using Supervised Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), Phase Retrieval of highly strained crystals is often challenging with standard iterative algorithms. This computational obstacle limits the potential of the technique as it precludes the reconstruction of physically interesting highly-strained particles. Here, we propose a novel approach to this problem using a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on 3D simulated diffraction data to predict the corresponding reciprocal space phase. This method allows to fully exploit the potential of the CNN by mapping functions within the same space and leveraging structural similarities between input and output. The final object is obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of the retrieved complex diffracted amplitude and is then further refined with iterative algorithms. We demonstrate that our model outperforms standard algorithms on highly strained simulated data not included in the training set, as well as on experimental data.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multistability and Hysteresis in Urban Traffic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the macroscopic functional states of urban road networks exhibit multistability and hysteresis, but microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that in real-world road networks, the recovery process of congested roads is not spontaneous, as assumed in existing models, but is hindered by connected congested roads, and such hindered recovery can lead to the emergence of multistability and hysteresis in urban traffic dynamics. By analyzing real-world urban traffic data, we observed that congestion propagation between individual roads is well described by a simple contagion process like an epidemic, but the recovery rate of a congested road decreases drastically by the congestion of the adjacent roads unlike an epidemic. Based on this microscopic observation, we proposed a simple model of congestion propagation and dissipation, and found that our model shows a discontinuous phase transition between macroscopic functional states of road networks when the recovery hindrance is strong enough through a mean-field approach and numerical simulations. Our findings shed light on an overlooked role of recovery processes in the collective dynamics of failures in networked systems.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10257v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. We confirm that the time-integrated probability flux exhibits patterns consistent with the pathways identified in the projected hypercubic energy landscapes. Using the mean-field model, we show that dominant state transition pathways tend to emerge around the periphery of the projected hypercubes. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>GetDist: a Python package for analysing Monte Carlo samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.13970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo techniques, including MCMC and other methods, are widely used in Bayesian inference to generate sets of samples from a parameter space of interest. The Python GetDist package provides tools for analysing these samples and calculating marginalized one- and two-dimensional densities using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). Many Monte Carlo methods produce correlated and/or weighted samples, for example produced by MCMC, nested, or importance sampling, and there can be hard boundary priors. GetDist's baseline method consists of applying a linear boundary kernel, and then using multiplicative bias correction. The smoothing bandwidth is selected automatically following Botev et al., based on a mixture of heuristics and optimization results using the expected scaling with an effective number of samples (defined here to account for both MCMC correlations and weights). Two-dimensional KDE uses an automatically-determined elliptical Gaussian kernel for correlated distributions. The package includes tools for producing a variety of publication-quality figures using a simple named-parameter interface, as well as a graphical user interface that can be used for interactive exploration. It can also calculate convergence diagnostics, produce tables of limits, and output in LaTeX, and is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and for predicting how its statistical properties change when a perturbation is applied. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieve enhanced practical applicability, response theory should be interpretable, capable of focusing on relevant timescales, and amenable to data-driven and equation-agnostic implementations. Along these lines, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we present linear and nonlinear response formulas for Markov chains. We obtain simple and easily implementable expressions that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as of higher-order correlations. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if the underlying evolution equations are unknown. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allows to elucidate the role of different time scales and modes of variability, and to find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

      <title>Lost in Retraining: Roaming the Parameter Space of Exponential Families Under Closed-Loop Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves. We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we show that this outcome may be prevented if the data contains at least one data point generated from a ground truth model, by relying on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.</description>
