      <title>A Roadmap for Predictive Human Immunology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a century, immunology has masterfully discovered and dissected the components of our immune system, yet its collective behavior remains fundamentally unpredictable. In this perspective, we argue that building on the learnings of reductionist biology and systems immunology, the field is poised for a third revolution. This new era will be driven by the convergence of purpose-built, large-scale causal experiments and predictive, generalizable AI models. Here, we propose the Predictive Immunology Loop as the unifying engine to harness this convergence. This closed loop iteratively uses AI to design maximally informative experiments and, in turn, leverages the resulting data to improve dynamic, in silico models of the human immune system across biological scales, culminating in a Virtual Immune System. This engine provides a natural roadmap for addressing immunology's grand challenges, from decoding molecular recognition to engineering tissue ecosystems. It also offers a framework to transform immunology from a descriptive discipline into one capable of forecasting and, ultimately, engineering human health.</description>

      <title>Physical fitness post VO2max -- a computational framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the conceptual and methodological limitations underlying the current understanding and application of VO2max in exercise science and physical activity prescription. Despite the establishment of WHO guidelines on physical activity, population-level adherence remains low. A key contributing factor is the continued reliance on VO2max as a central measure of physical fitness - an index that represents statistical relationships within large populations that provides limited insight or utility at the individual level. The authors demonstrate that the intrinsic constraints of VO2max make it unsuitable for the development of precise computational models capable of informing individualized exercise prescription. The paper reviews fundamental principles linking health, fitness, and exercise intensity, identifying critical gaps in how these constructs are conceptualized and operationalized. In response, alternative theoretical and methodological frameworks are proposed to more accurately capture the complex interplay between physiological and psychological factors that determine exercise performance and adherence. Building on this conceptual foundation, the authors introduce a novel computational approach that mathematically models these complex interdependencies and the various variables that affect adherence outcomes. A comprehensive empirical research framework and corresponding methodologies for deriving the required model equations are presented. Successful empirical validation of this model could provide a transformative step toward personalized, adaptive training systems enhancing both the efficacy and long-term adherence of health-oriented exercise programs.</description>
