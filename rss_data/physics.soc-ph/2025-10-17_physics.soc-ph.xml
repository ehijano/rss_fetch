      <title>Airborne assessment uncovers socioeconomic stratification of urban nature in England</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban green infrastructure is essential for climate resilience, public health, and environmental justice. Yet, the absence of standardised methods to quantify urban nature hinders the development of equitable greening policies. In this study, we present the first national, building-level assessment of the 3-30-300 urban greening rule, a policy framework proposing that every citizen should see three trees from their home, live in a neighbourhood with 30\% canopy cover, and reside within 300 m of a public green space. Using high-resolution LiDAR (Vegetation Object Model), Sentinel 2 imagery, and open geospatial datasets for over 28 million buildings across England, we integrate raster, vector, and socioeconomic data within a scalable computational framework. Tree segmentation was performed using adaptive local-maximum filtering, canopy cover estimated at 1 m resolution, and park accessibility derived from network-based walking distances. Inequality in access to nature was quantified via Gini coefficients and modelled with spatial error regressions against socioeconomic deprivation. Our results reveal that while most urban areas meet the 3-tree proximity rule, fewer than 3\% achieve 30\% canopy cover, and only a minority satisfy all three components simultaneously. Crucially, ambient greenness (trees and canopy) is concentrated in affluent areas, whereas proximity to parks is greatest in dense, often deprived urban centres, exposing a multidimensional nature gap. This framework establishes a reproducible, open, and computationally efficient blueprint for evaluating urban nature equity at scale, supporting the integration of environmental justice metrics into national urban planning agendas.</description>

      <title>From classical to active particles: mathematical tools for social dynamics and behavioural economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay provides a critical overview of the mathematical kinetic theory of active particles, which is used to model and study collective systems consisting of interacting living entities, such as those involved in behavior and evolution. The main objective is to study the interactions of large systems of living entities mathematically. More specifically, the study relates to the complex features of living systems and the mathematical tools inspired by statistical physics. The focus is on the mathematical description of these interactions and their role in deriving differential systems that describe the aforementioned dynamics. The paper demonstrates that studying these interactions naturally yields new mathematical insights into systems in the natural sciences and behavioral economics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Public Opinion Dynamics: The Spiral of silence in clustered homophilic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public discourse emerges from the interplay between individuals' willingness to voice their opinions and the structural features of the social networks in which they are embedded. In this work we investigate how choice homophily and triadic closure shape the emergence of the spiral of silence, the phenomenon whereby minority views are progressively silenced due to fear of isolation. We advance the state of the art in three ways. First, we integrate a realistic network formation model, where homophily and triadic closure co-evolve, with a mean-field model of opinion expression. Second, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the associated Q-learning dynamics, revealing conditions for hysteresis and path dependence in collective expression. Third, we validate our theoretical predictions through Monte Carlo simulations, which highlight the role of finite-size effects and structural noise. Our results show that moderate triadic closure can foster minority expression by reinforcing local cohesion, whereas excessive closure amplifies asymmetries and entrenches majority dominance. These findings provide new insights into how algorithmic reinforcement of clustering in online platforms can either sustain diversity of opinion or accelerate its suppression.</description>

      <title>Musical consonance: a review of theory and evidence on perception and preference of auditory roughness in humans and other animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of consonance in human music has long been contested, and today there are three primary hypotheses: aversion to roughness, preference for harmonicity, and learned preferences from cultural exposure. While the evidence is currently insufficient to disentangle the contributions of these hypotheses, I propose several reasons why roughness is an especially promising area for future study. The aim of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate roughness theory and models, experimental data, to highlight areas that deserve further research. I identify 2 key areas: There are fundamental issues with the definition and interpretation of results due to tautology in the definition of roughness, and the lack of independence in empirical measurements. Despite extensive model development, there are many duplications and models have issues with data quality and overfitting. Future theory development should aim for model simplicity, and extra assumptions, features and parameters should be evaluated systematically. Model evaluation should aim to maximise the breadth of stimuli that are predicted.</description>

      <title>A data-driven analysis of the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic diffusion in urban settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individuals who do not comply with public health safety measures pose a significant challenge to effective epidemic control, as their risky behaviours can undermine public health interventions. This is particularly relevant in urban environments because of their high population density and complex social interactions. In this study, we employ detailed contact networks, built using a data-driven approach, to examine the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic dynamics in three major Italian cities: Torino, Milano, and Palermo. We use a heterogeneous extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model that distinguishes between ordinary and non-compliant individuals, who are more infectious and/or more susceptible. By combining electoral data with recent findings on vaccine hesitancy, we obtain spatially heterogeneous distributions of non-compliance. Epidemic simulations demonstrate that even a small proportion of non-compliant individuals in the population can substantially increase the number of infections and accelerate the timing of their peak. Furthermore, the impact of non-compliance is greatest when disease transmission rates are moderate. Including the heterogeneous, data-driven distribution of non-compliance in the simulations results in infection hotspots forming with varying intensity according to the disease transmission rate. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of monitoring behavioural compliance and tailoring public health interventions to address localised risks.</description>

      <title>Ideology and polarization set the agenda on social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundance of information on social media has reshaped public discussions, shifting attention to the mechanisms that drive online discourse. This study analyzes large-scale Twitter (now X) data from three global debates--Climate Change, COVID-19, and the Russo-Ukrainian War--to investigate the structural dynamics of engagement. Our findings reveal that discussions are not primarily shaped by specific categories of actors, such as media or activists, but by shared ideological alignment. Users consistently form polarized communities, where their ideological stance in one debate predicts their positions in others. This polarization transcends individual topics, reflecting a broader pattern of ideological divides. Furthermore, the influence of individual actors within these communities appears secondary to the reinforcing effects of selective exposure and shared narratives. Overall, our results underscore that ideological alignment, rather than actor prominence, plays a central role in structuring online discourse and shaping the spread of information in polarized environments.</description>
