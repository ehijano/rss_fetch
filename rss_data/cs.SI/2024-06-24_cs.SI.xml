      <title>Generating geographically and economically realistic large-scale synthetic contact networks: A general method using publicly available data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic contact networks are useful for modeling epidemic spread and social transmission, but data to infer realistic contact patterns that take account of assortative connections at the geographic and economic levels is limited. We developed a method to generate synthetic contact networks for any region of the United States based on publicly available data. First, we generate a synthetic population of individuals within households from US census data using combinatorial optimization. Then, individuals are assigned to workplaces and schools using commute data, employment statistics, and school enrollment data. The resulting population is then connected into a realistic contact network using graph generation algorithms. We test the method on two census regions and show that the synthetic populations accurately reflect the source data. We further show that the contact networks have distinct properties compared to networks generated without a synthetic population, and that those differences affect the rate of disease transmission in an epidemiological simulation. We provide open-source software to generate a synthetic population and contact network for any area within the US.</description>

      <title>Complex network community discovery using fast local move iterated greedy algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examining the community structures within intricate networks is crucial for comprehending their intrinsic dynamics and functionality. The paper presents the Fast Local Move Iterated Greedy (FLMIG) algorithm, a novel method designed to effectively identify community structures in intricate networks. The FLMIG algorithm improves the modularity optimization process by including a rapid local move heuristic and an iterated greedy mechanism that switches between destructive and constructive phases to strengthen the community partitions. The main innovation is the integration of random neighbor moves with an enhanced Prune Louvain algorithm, which guarantees fast convergence while maintaining the connection of the identified communities. The results of our comprehensive studies, conducted on both synthetic and and real-world networks, clearly show that FLMIG surpasses existing cutting-edge techniques in terms of both accuracy and computing efficiency. This algorithm not only provides a strong tool for identifying communities, but also makes a valuable contribution to the broader field of network analysis by offering a method that can effectively handle large-scale and dynamically evolving networks.</description>

      <title>Consistent community detection in multi-layer networks with heterogeneous differential privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As network data has become increasingly prevalent, a substantial amount of attention has been paid to the privacy issue in publishing network data. One of the critical challenges for data publishers is to preserve the topological structures of the original network while protecting sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a personalized edge flipping mechanism that allows data publishers to protect edge information based on each node's privacy preference. It can achieve differential privacy while preserving the community structure under the multi-layer degree-corrected stochastic block model after appropriately debiasing, and thus consistent community detection in the privatized multi-layer networks is achievable. Theoretically, we establish the consistency of community detection in the privatized multi-layer network and show that better privacy protection of edges can be obtained for a proportion of nodes while allowing other nodes to give up their privacy. Furthermore, the advantage of the proposed personalized edge-flipping mechanism is also supported by its numerical performance on various synthetic networks and a real-life multi-layer network.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Agents for Collaborative Task under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have achieved great progress in solving complex tasks. It performs communication among agents within the system to collaboratively solve tasks, under the premise of shared information. However, when agents' communication is leveraged to enhance human cooperation, a new challenge arises due to information asymmetry, since each agent can only access the information of its human user. Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication towards effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry. Experimental results show that iAgents can collaborate within a social network of 140 individuals and 588 relationships, autonomously communicate over 30 turns, and retrieve information from nearly 70,000 messages to complete tasks within 3 minutes.</description>

      <title>Online detection and infographic explanation of spam reviews with data drift adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spam reviews are a pervasive problem on online platforms due to its significant impact on reputation. However, research into spam detection in data streams is scarce. Another concern lies in their need for transparency. Consequently, this paper addresses those problems by proposing an online solution for identifying and explaining spam reviews, incorporating data drift adaptation. It integrates (i) incremental profiling, (ii) data drift detection &amp; adaptation, and (iii) identification of spam reviews employing Machine Learning. The explainable mechanism displays a visual and textual prediction explanation in a dashboard. The best results obtained reached up to 87 % spam F-measure.</description>

      <title>Transferability of Graph Neural Networks using Graphon and Sampling Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become powerful tools for processing graph-based information in various domains. A desirable property of GNNs is transferability, where a trained network can swap in information from a different graph without retraining and retain its accuracy. A recent method of capturing transferability of GNNs is through the use of graphons, which are symmetric, measurable functions representing the limit of large dense graphs. In this work, we contribute to the application of graphons to GNNs by presenting an explicit two-layer graphon neural network (WNN) architecture. We prove its ability to approximate bandlimited graphon signals within a specified error tolerance using a minimal number of network weights. We then leverage this result, to establish the transferability of an explicit two-layer GNN over all sufficiently large graphs in a convergent sequence. Our work addresses transferability between both deterministic weighted graphs and simple random graphs and overcomes issues related to the curse of dimensionality that arise in other GNN results. The proposed WNN and GNN architectures offer practical solutions for handling graph data of varying sizes while maintaining performance guarantees without extensive retraining.</description>

      <title>ESND: An Embedding-based Framework for Signed Network Dismantling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network dismantling aims to maximize the disintegration of a network by removing a specific set of nodes or edges and is applied to various tasks in diverse domains, such as cracking down on crime organizations, delaying the propagation of rumors, and blocking the transmission of viruses. Most of the current network dismantling methods are tailored for unsigned networks, which only consider the connection between nodes without evaluating the nature of the relationships, such as friendship/hostility, enhancing/repressing, and trust/distrust. We here propose an embedding-based algorithm, namely ESND, to solve the signed network dismantling problem. The algorithm generally iterates the following four steps, i.e., giant component detection, network embedding, node clustering, and removal node selection. To illustrate the efficacy and stability of ESND, we conduct extensive experiments on six signed network datasets as well as null models, and compare the performance of our method with baselines. Experimental results consistently show that the proposed ESND is superior to the baselines and displays stable performance with the change in the network structure. Additionally, we examine the impact of sign proportions on network robustness via ESND, observing that networks with a high ratio of negative edges are generally easier to dismantle than networks with high positive edges.</description>
