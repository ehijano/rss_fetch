      <title>Electronic origin of the reorganization energy in interfacial electron transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The activation free energy of electron transfer (ET) reactions is governed by a crucial parameter: the reorganization energy. In heterogeneous ET at electrified solid-liquid interfaces, it is presumed that only factors in the electrolyte phase are responsible for determining the reorganization energy. Here, we demonstrate the contribution of the electronic density of states (DOS) of the electrode to the reorganization energy. Using van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals, we tune the DOS of graphene and measure its impact on outer-sphere ET. We find the ensuing variation in ET rate arises from modulation in a reorganization energy associated with image potential localization in the electrode, which is dependent on the DOS. This work establishes a fundamental role of the electrode electronic structure in interfacial charge transfer.</description>

      <title>Pull-off force prediction in viscoelastic adhesive Hertzian contact by physics augmented machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the adhesive properties of viscoelastic Hertzian contacts is crucial for diverse engineering applications, including robotics, biomechanics, and advanced material design. The maximum adherence force of a Hertzian indenter unloaded from a viscoelastic substrate has been studied with analytical and numerical models. Analytical models are valid within their assumptions, numerical methods offer precision but can be computationally expensive, necessitating alternative solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-augmented machine learning (PA-ML) framework as a hybrid approach, bridging the gap between analytical models and data-driven solutions, which is capable of rapidly predicting the pull-off force in an Hertzian profile unloaded from a broad band viscoelastic material, with varying Tabor parameter, preload and retraction rate. Compared to previous models, the PA-ML approach provides fast yet accurate predictions in a wide range of conditions, properly predicting the effective surface energy and the work-to-pull-off. The integration of the analytical model provides critical guidance to the PA-ML framework, supporting physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that physics augmentation enhances predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error (MSE) while increasing model efficiency and interpretability. We provide data-driven and PA-ML models for real-time predictions of the adherence force in soft materials like silicons and elastomers opening to the possibility to integrate PA-ML into materials and interface design. The models are openly available on Zenodo and GitHub.</description>

      <title>Explainable Machine Learning for Oxygen Diffusion in Perovskites and Pyrochlores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable machine learning can help to discover new physical relationships for material properties. To understand the material properties that govern the activation energy for oxygen diffusion in perovskites and pyrochlores, we build a database of experimental activation energies and apply a grouping algorithm to the material property features. These features are then used to fit seven different machine learning models. An ensemble consensus determines that the most important features for predicting the activation energy are the ionicity of the A-site bond and the partial pressure of oxygen for perovskites. For pyrochlores, the two most important features are the A-site $s$ valence electron count and the B-site electronegativity. The most important features are all constructed using the weighted averages of elemental metal properties, despite weighted averages of the constituent binary oxides being included in our feature set. This is surprising because the material properties of the constituent oxides are more similar to the experimentally measured properties of perovskites and pyrochlores than the features of the metals that are chosen. The easy-to-measure features identified in this work enable rapid screening for new materials with fast oxide-ion diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Domain formation and correlation effects in quenched uniaxial ferroelectrics: A stochastic model perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic analysis of the polarization domain structures, emerging after quenching from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state, in terms of the polarization correlation functions and their Fourier transforms is a fast and effective tool of the materials structure characterization. In spite of a significant volume of experimental data accumulated over the last three decades for the model uniaxial ferroelectric triglycine sulfate, there were no theoretical tools to comprehend these data until now. This work summarizes the recent progress in understanding of the experiments by means of the original stochastic model of polarization structure formation based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory and the Gauss random field concept assuming the predominance of the quenched polarization disorder over the thermal fluctuations. The system of integrodifferential equations for correlation functions of random polarization and electric field turns out to be analytically solvable. The model provides explanations to a range of experimental results on the polarization formation kinetics including the time-dependent correlation lengths and correlation functions on the macroscopic spatial and time scales. Notably, it predicts the dependence of the ferroelectric coercive field on the initial disordered state characteristics, which can be controlled by quenching parameters like the initial temperature and the cooling rate, thus paving the way for tailoring the functional properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Photon Magnon Interplay via Saturation Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon magnon hybrid systems present a promising platform for the development of next generation devices in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technologies. In this study, we investigate the control of photon magnon coupling (PMC) strength through systematic variation of the saturation magnetization in a planar hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) integrated with a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film configuration. Using full wave numerical simulations in CST Microwave Studio, we demonstrate that tuning the Ms of the YIG film from 1750 Oe to 900 Oe enables systematic control over the coupling strength across the 127 to 51 MHz range at room temperature. To explain the observed PMC dynamics, we develop a semiclassical analytical model based on electromagnetic theory that accurately reproduces the observed coupling behavior, revealing the key role of spin density in mediating the light matter interaction. The model is further extended to include the effects of variable magnon damping across different Ms values, enabling broader frequency control. These findings establish Ms as a key tuning parameter for tailoring PMC, with direct implications for the design of tunable hybrid systems for reconfigurable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the thermal transport properties of Biphenylene nanotubes: A molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphenylene nanotubes (BPNNTs) represent a novel class of carbon-based nanomaterials, constructed by rolling a biphenylene network (BPN) monolayer into a one-dimensional tubular structure. In this study, the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs are investigated using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. At room temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity of armchair and zigzag BPNNTs is found to be approximately 100 W/m.K and 90 W/m.K, respectively. These values are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This significant reduction is attributed to the unique atomic arrangement of BPNNTs, which promotes enhanced phonon scattering and significantly lower phonon group velocity. Furthermore, the effects of nanotube length, diameter, and temperature on thermal transport are systematically analyzed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the geometry- and temperature-dependent thermal behavior, a comprehensive analysis of phonon dispersion relations, vibrational density of states, and phonon group velocities is conducted. This study offers valuable insight into the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs, with implications for thermal management and energy-related applications.</description>

      <title>Data Mining and Computational Screening of Rashba-Dresselhaus Splitting and Optoelectronic Properties in Two-Dimensional Perovskite Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments highlighting the promise of two-dimensional perovskites have vastly increased the compositional search space in the perovskite family. This presents a great opportunity for the realization of highly performant devices, and practical challenges associated with the identification of candidate materials. High-fidelity computational screening offers great value in this regard. In this study, we carry out a multiscale computational workflow, generating a dataset of two-dimensional perovskites in the Dion-Jacobson and Ruddlesden-Popper phases. Our dataset comprises ten B-site cations, four halogens, and over 20 organic cations across over 2,000 materials. We compute electronic properties, thermoelectric performance, and numerous geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for the high-throughput computation of Rashba-Dresselhaus splitting. Finally, we use this dataset to train machine learning models for the accurate prediction of band gaps, candidate Rashba-Dresselhaus materials, and partial charges. The work presented herein can aid future investigations of two-dimensional perovskites with targeted applications in mind.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Graphene: Capturing Stress-Strain and Vibrational Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer an efficient and accurate framework for large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, effectively bridging the gap between classical force fields and \textit{ab initio} methods. In this work, we present a reactive MLIP for graphene, trained on an extensive dataset generated via \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The model accurately reproduces key mechanical and vibrational properties, including stress-strain behavior, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, and vibrational density of states. Notably, it captures temperature-dependent fracture mechanisms and the emergence of linear acetylenic carbon chains upon tearing. The phonon analysis also reveals the expected quadratic ZA mode and excellent agreement with experimental and DFT benchmarks. Our MLIP scales linearly with system size, enabling simulations of large graphene sheets with \textit{ab initio}-level precision. This work delivers a robust and transferable MLIP, alongside an accessible training workflow that can be extended to other materials.</description>

      <title>Thermal and thermoelectric transport in monolayer h-NbN: Roles of four-phonon scattering and tensile strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlocking the thermal and thermoelectric potential of 2D materials, we explore the h-NbN monolayer, which lacks mirror symmetry and features a large acoustic-optical phonon gap and quadratic flexural mode. First-principles calculations and the Boltzmann transport formalism reveal a complex interplay of multi-phonon scattering processes, where flexural phonons and four-phonon interactions play a significant role in heat transport, primarily dominated by acoustic phonons. Notably, the four-phonon interactions are predominantly confined to acoustic phonons. Tensile strain preserves the underlying scattering mechanisms while reducing anharmonicity, consequently, the scattering rates, enhancing thermal conduction. Simultaneously, competing modifications in thermal and electrical transport shape the strain-dependent thermoelectric response, achieving a figure of merit approaching 1 at elevated temperatures, a testament to its thermoelectric promise. Our findings underscore the critical role of microscopic transport modeling in accurately capturing thermal and thermoelectric properties, paving the way for advanced applications of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Potential for Accurate Shock Response Simulations in Tin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tin (Sn) plays a crucial role in studying the dynamic mechanical responses of ductile metals under shock loading. Atomistic simulations serves to unveil the nano-scale mechanisms for critical behaviors of dynamic responses. However, existing empirical potentials for Sn often lack sufficient accuracy when applied in such simulation. Particularly, the solid-solid phase transition behavior of Sn poses significant challenges to the accuracy of interatomic potentials. To address these challenges, this study introduces a machine-learning potential model for Sn, specifically optimized for shock-response simulations. The model is trained using a dataset constructed through a concurrent learning framework and is designed for molecular simulations across thermodynamic conditions ranging from 0 to 100 GPa and 0 to 5000 K, encompassing both solid and liquid phases as well as structures with free surfaces. It accurately reproduces density functional theory (DFT)-derived basic properties, experimental melting curves, solid-solid phase boundaries, and shock Hugoniot results. This demonstrates the model's potential to bridge ab initio precision with large-scale dynamic simulations of Sn.</description>

      <title>Breaking Sensitivity Barriers in Luminescence Thermometry: Synergy Between Structural Phase Transition and Luminescence Thermal Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key parameters determining the performance of a luminescent thermometer is its relative sensitivity. In ratiometric luminescence thermometry, high relative sensitivity to temperature variations is typically achieved when the two monitored emission bands exhibit opposite thermal monotonicity. However, realizing a thermal enhancement in the luminescence intensity of one of the emission bands remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages the synergistic effect of two phenomena: (1) the high thermal sensitivity of Mn4+ ion luminescence, and (2) a thermally induced structural phase transition in LaGaO3, which facilitates the enhancement of the luminescence signal from Tb3+ ions in the high-temperature phase of the host material. This dual effect not only led to an increased maximum relative sensitivity but also extended the temperature range over which the sensitivity exceeded 1% K-1. The highest recorded sensitivity was 4.5 K-1 at 400 K. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the luminescence of Mn4+ ions in the high-temperature phase of LaGaO3:Mn4+ was observed and reported here for the first time. The thermally induced modifications in the emission profile of LaGaO3:Mn4+,Tb3+ enabled the development of a quadruple ratiometric luminescence thermometer, with complementary operating ranges, offering enhanced versatility and accuracy across a broad temperature span.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Early Stages of Oxidation at Copper Terrace: The Role of O-O Repulsion and Substrate-mediated Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper-based catalysts play a crucial role in industrial oxidation reactions. Although many theoretical studies consider copper to be metallic, it is well established that copper readily oxides at ambient conditions, forming a passivating oxide layer. Experimental investigations spanning two decades have shown that in addition to the anticipated step-oxide formation, oxide can directly form at the Cu(111) terrace. The atomistically-resolved mechanism for direct oxidation at flat terraces remains unknown. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the formation of subsurface oxide occurs through a coordinated mechanism that takes place in the presence of specific clusters of adsorbed oxygen atoms. Certain oxygen atoms in the cluster function like pincers to extract a copper atom from the surface layer and induce localized surface restructuring. This process creates open channels that allow an oxygen atom to diffuse into the subsurface layer. The subsurface oxide formation is barrierless. This implies that the Cu oxide surface is highly dynamic. At low O coverages, subsurface oxidation is unlikely via step oxide growth nor direct terrace oxidation as the subsurface oxygen is unstable. Substrate mediated O-Cu-O adsorbate interactions govern the oxide stability. These insights provide a foundation for developing a more accurate dynamic models for copper catalysis.</description>

      <title>Variability analysis in memristors based on electrodeposited prussian blue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the variability and reliability of the resistive switching (RS) behavior in Prussian Blue (a mixed-valence iron(III/II) hexacyanoferrate compound) thin films, used as the active layer. These films are fabricated through a simple and scalable electrochemical process, and exhibit robust bipolar resistive switching, making them suitable both for neuromorphic computing applications and hardware cryptography. A detailed statistical evaluation was conducted over 100 consecutive switching cycles using multiple parameter extraction techniques to assess cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variability in key RS parameters, including set/reset voltages and corresponding currents. One and two-dimensional coefficients of variation (1DCV and 2DCV) were calculated to quantify variability and identify application potential. Results demonstrate moderate variability compatible with neuromorphic computing and cryptographic functionalities, including physical unclonable functions and true random number generation. These findings position Prussian Blue-based memristors as promising candidates for low-cost, stable, and multifunctional memory.</description>

      <title>Nanoindentation simulations for copper and tungsten with adaptive-precision potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform nanoindentation simulations for both the prototypical face-centered cubic metal copper and the body-centered cubic metal tungsten with a new adaptive-precision description of interaction potentials including different accuracy and computational costs: We combine both a computationally efficient embedded atom method (EAM) potential and a precise but computationally less efficient machine learning potential based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) into an adaptive-precision (AP) potential tailored for the nanoindentation. The numerically expensive ACE potential is employed selectively only in regions of the computational cell where large accuracy is required. The comparison with pure EAM and pure ACE simulations shows that for Cu, all potentials yield similar dislocation morphologies under the indenter with only small quantitative differences. In contrast, markedly different plasticity mechanisms are observed for W in simulations performed with the central-force EAM potential compared to results obtained using the ACE potential which is able to describe accurately the angular character of bonding in W due to its half-filled d-band. All ACE-specific mechanisms are reproduced in the AP nanoindentation simulations, however, with a significant speedup of 20-30 times compared to the pure ACE simulations. Hence, the AP potential overcomes the performance gap between the precise ACE and the fast EAM potential by combining the advantages of both potentials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Laser Induces Macroscopic Symmetry-Breaking of Diamond Color Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) to investigate the electron-phonon-spin correlated dynamics in negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV$^{-}$) and construct a comprehensive dynamical picture. Laser excitation promotes minority-spin electrons within 100~fs, establishing a three-fold rotation symmetry breaking (3RSB) charge ordering. Subsequently, ionic motion on the potential energy surface of the excited electrons generates two distinct dynamical modes: (1) symmetric oscillations of carbon-nitrogen bonds and (2) dynamic Jahn-Teller distortions (DJT) with 3RSB. These distortions induce nonlocal coherent phonons in the diamond lattice, which propagate with 3RSB at the sound velocity ($\sim$2~\AA/fs). Furthermore, the NV$^{-}$ spin state remains preserved during photoexcitation but undergoes rapid reorientation within 100~fs via enhanced spin-orbit-phonon coupling. Our RT-TDDFT simulations provide direct time-resolved visualization of these processes, offering novel insights into the microscopic interplay of electrons, phonons, and spins in NV$^{-}$ centers. These results advance the fundamental understanding of dynamical mechanisms in solid-state quantum systems, with implications for optimizing NV$^{-}$-based quantum sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Competing Magnetic States in the Candidate Altermagnet GdAlGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic order, combines zero net magnetization with non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic bands. Its ability to utilize the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets is highly promising for spintronic applications. Currently, the merge of altermagnetism and weak ferromagnetism in a single material excites significant interest as it provides additional control mechanisms over material properties. However, the role of dimensionality in this interplay is yet to be explored. Here, we study magnetism and electron transport in epitaxial films of the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe ranging from bulklike to a single monolayer. The films exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and negative magnetoresistance. In contrast to altermagnetic GdAlSi, the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe demonstrates an admixture of the ferromagnetic state which contribution increases as the system approaches the 2D limit. The coexistence of the magnetic states induces technologically important intrinsic exchange bias. The present work underpins future studies and applications of nanoscale altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: In this work we use first principles density-functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation together with tight-binding based maximally localized wannier functions (MLWF-TB) to investigate the electronic, optical and topological properties of two-dimensional bismuth (bismuthene) containing vacancy defects. We demonstrate that these properties depends on the shape and size of the nanopores. Furthermore, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations shows that all pores are thermally stable at room temperature. Finally, adsorption of gas phase small molecules indicates that these pores can serve as sensors, opening the path for further applications in gas separation and sensing.</description>

      <title>Lattice thermal conductivity of 16 elemental metals from molecular dynamics simulations with a unified neuroevolution potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals play a crucial role in heat management in electronic devices, such as integrated circuits, making it vital to understand heat transport in elementary metals and alloys. In this work, we systematically study phonon thermal transport in 16 metals using the efficient homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method and the recently developed unified neuroevolution potential version 1 (UNEP-v1) for 16 metals and their alloys. We compare our results with existing ones based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach and find that our HNEMD results align well with BTE results obtained by considering phonon-phonon scattering only. By contrast, HNEMD results based on the conventional embedded-atom method potential show less satisfactory agreement with BTE ones. Given the high accuracy of the UNEP-v1 model demonstrated in various metal alloys, we anticipate that the HNEMD method combined with the UNEP-v1 model will be a promising tool for exploring phonon thermal transport properties in complex systems such as high-entropy alloys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly on the experimentally observed (111) plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy forms a prismatic dislocation loop on the (111) plane for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In planar altermagnets, optical excitation by linearly polarized ultrashort pulses can induce spin polarizations in the electronic excited states in a controlled fashion, even though the material is magnetically compensated. Here, we theoretically analyze the response of the prototypical bulk g-wave altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe to polarized ultrashort pulses. By calculating the excited electron distributions based on ab-initio band structure data, we show how this excited electronic spin response in $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits different symmetries which are determined by the nodal planes intrinsic to the bulk g-wave altermagnet. We present a simple procedure to obtain the symmetry of the electronic spin response from the two-dimensional cuts through the three-dimensional band structure.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals-Driven Network Restructuring Explains Time-Dependent Piezoresistivity in Soft Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-elastomer composites exhibit complex piezoresistive behaviour that cannot be fully explained by existing macroscopic or microstructural models. In this work, we introduce a network-based modelling methodology to explore the hypothesis that van der Waals interactions between carbon particles contribute to the formation of a conductivity-promoting network structure prior to curing. We combine a discrete aggregate-based representation of filler with a mesh-free, quasi-static viscoelastic model adapted from bond-based peridynamics, resolving equilibrium states through energy minimization. The resulting particle networks are analysed using graph-theoretic measures of connectivity and conductivity. Our simulations reproduce several unexplained experimental phenomena, including long-timescale resistivity decay, non-monotonic secondary peaks upon strain release, and the increasing prominence of these features with higher filler density. Crucially, these behaviours emerge from the interplay between viscoelastic stresses and van der Waals interactions. We show that the resistance response of the network operates over different characteristic timescales to the viscoelastic stress response. The approach has potential for understanding and predicting emergent behaviour in composite materials more broadly, where material characteristics often depend on percolating network structure.</description>

      <title>A Robust Synthesis of Fluorosurfactants with Tunable Functions via a Two-Step Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorosurfactant-stabilized microdroplets hold significant promise for a wide range of applications, owing to their biological and chemical inertness. However, conventional synthetic routes for fluorosurfactants typically require multiple reaction steps and stringent conditions, such as high temperatures and anaerobic environments. This complexity poses a significant limitation to the development of fluorosurfactant synthesis and their subsequent applications in droplet-based systems. In this work, we present a robust two-step synthesis of fluorosurfactants with tunable functionalities. Microdroplets stabilized by these fluorosurfactants exhibit enhanced stability and biocompatibility. Notably, these fluorosurfactants facilitate the formation of nanodroplets that efficiently transport and concentrate fluorophores with high selectivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that colloidal self-assemblies with tunable morphologies can be engineered by modulating interactions between the fluorosurfactants and colloidal particles. Our synthetic approach provides a strategy for the rapid production of functional fluorosurfactants under mild conditions, enabling droplet-based microfluidic techniques with applications in biology and material science.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in a quantum fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractal geometries exhibit complex structures with scale invariance self-similar pattern over various length scales. An artificially designed quantum fractal geometry embedded in a uniform magnetic flux has been explored in this study. It has been found that due to quantum mechanical effect, such quantum fractal display an exotic electronic property which is reflected in its transport characteristics. Owing to this uniform magnetic flux piercing through each closed-loop building block of the fractal structure, an electron traversing through such a fractal geometry will pick up a nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, which will influence its transport through the system. It is shown that, one can completely block the transmission of an electron in this fractal geometry by setting the value of the uniform magnetic flux to half flux quantum. This phenomenon of Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in this quantum fractal geometry has been supported by the computation of the energy spectrum, two-terminal transport and persistent current in its various generations. This result is very robust against disorder and could be useful in designing efficient quantum algorithms using a quantum fractal network.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions and Cluster Formation: Boosting Surface Thermopower in Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates the thermoelectric properties of magnetic topological insulators (TIs), with a focus on the effects of magnetic atom exchange interactions on the thermopower of their surfaces. Our findings demonstrate that interactions among magnetic atoms significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient. The formation of magnetic clusters through exchange interactions increases the scattering of Dirac electrons, thereby improving the thermoelectric power factor. We conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations across various configurations, including ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bulk materials, comparing magnetic clustering in Ising and Heisenberg models. Special attention was given to cluster definitions related to surface critical temperatures. Our analysis indicates that the size and number of magnetic clusters influence relaxation times, as well as electrical and thermal resistivities, ultimately affecting the thermopower. Optimized interlayer and intralayer interactions can elevate the surface thermopower of TIs to values comparable to those observed in antiferromagnetic ${\rm MnTe}$, renowned for its unique spin-based thermoelectric properties. This work highlights the potential of magnetic TIs for thermoelectric applications and sets the stage for future research.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor quantum well magnetic memory using confinement from proximity exchange fields for high magnetoresistances in a field-effect transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing demand for highly-performant memories and memristive technologies for use in in-memory computing. Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have thus far addressed this need in the field of spintronics. Despite their low write power and high speeds, MTJs are limited by their modest on/off ratio at room temperature, which motivates a search for beyond-MTJ spintronic devices. In this work, we propose a device that uses two layers of ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) cladding a semiconductor QW, which is able to modulate the QW bandgap via electronic confinement resulting from proximity magnetization at the interfaces of the quantum well depending on the relative magnetization of the FMI layers. We predict that this device has the potential for very high magnetoresistances (MRs) possibly exceeding 10,000% at room temperature. We also predict that this device will operate with maximal MR in charge neutrality, and that electrostatic gating may promote the device to act as a magnetic memtransistor. This motivates the search for candidate materials and ultimately experimental demonstration of magnetic QW memories or memtransistors, which may have the potential to advance the state of the art in logic, memory, or neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Search for Superconductors Using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of critical temperature $(T_c)$ of a superconductor remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. While the BCS theory explains superconductivity in conventional superconductors, there is no framework to predict $T_c$ of unconventional, higher $T_{c}$ superconductors. Quantum Structure Diagrams (QSD) were successful in establishing structure-property relationship for superconductors, quasicrystals, and ferroelectric materials starting from chemical composition. Building on the QSD ideas, we demonstrate that the principal component analysis of superconductivity data uncovers the clustering of various classes of superconductors. We use machine learning analysis and cleaned databases of superconductors to develop predictive models of $T_c$ of a superconductor using its chemical composition. Earlier studies relied on datasets with inconsistencies, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this, we introduce a data-cleaning workflow to enhance the statistical quality of superconducting databases by eliminating redundancies and resolving inconsistencies. With this improvised database, we apply a supervised machine learning framework and develop a Random Forest model to predict superconductivity and $T_c$ as a function of descriptors motivated from Quantum Structure Diagrams. We demonstrate that this model generalizes effectively in reasonably accurate prediction of $T_{c}$ of compounds outside the database. We further employ our model to systematically screen materials across materials databases as well as various chemically plausible combinations of elements and predict $\mathrm{Tl}_{5}\mathrm{Ba}_{6}\mathrm{Ca}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{9}\mathrm{O}_{29}$ to exhibit superconductivity with a $T_{c}$ $\sim$ 105 K. Being based on the descriptors used in QSD's, our model bypasses structural information and predicts $T_{c}$ merely from the chemical composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular graph neural networks (GNNs) often focus exclusively on XYZ-based geometric representations and thus overlook valuable chemical context available in public databases like PubChem. This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.</description>

Abstract: We report the epitaxial growth of high-quality Al0.8Ga0.2Sb-InAs-Al0.8Ga0.2Sb quantum well films featured by high carrier mobility and strong spin-orbit coupling. By appropriately optimizing the Al-to-Ga ratio in the AlGaSb barrier layer, the quantum confinement of the heterostructure is significantlyenhanced, which results in both an ultra-high electron mobility of 924000 cm2/Vs and a giant magnetoresistance ratio of 365000 at low temperatures. Meanwhile, pronounced Shubnikov-deHaas quantum oscillations persist up to 30 K, and their single-frequency feature indicates a well defined Fermi surface without subband mixing in the two-dimensional electron gas channel. Moreover, the large effective g-factor of 12.93 leads to the observation of Zeeman splitting at large magnetic fields. Our results validate the AlGaSb/InAs quantum well heterostructures as a suitable candidate for constructing energy-efficient topological spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated ambient pressure superconductivity in compressively strained La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films, yet the phase diagram of heterovalent doping$-$critical for advancing the field$-$remains unexplored. Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} &gt; 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique combination of energy conservation and nonlinear behavior exhibited by Josephson junctions has driven transformative advances in modern quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits. These superconducting devices underpin essential developments across quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communication and open pathways to innovative applications in nonreciprocal electronics. These developments are enabled by recent breakthroughs in nanofabrication and characterization methodologies, substantially enhancing device performance and scalability. The resulting innovations reshape our understanding of quantum systems and enable practical applications. This perspective explores the foundational role of Josephson junctions research in propelling quantum technologies forward. We underscore the critical importance of synergistic progress in material science, device characterization, and nanofabrication to catalyze the next wave of breakthroughs and accelerate the transition from fundamental discoveries to industrial-scale quantum utilities. Drawing parallels with the transformative impact of transistor-based integrated circuits during the Information Age, we envision Josephson junction-based circuits as central to driving a similar revolution in the emerging Quantum Age.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-to-spin conversion under quantum confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the B\"uttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergent High-Entropy Phases in Geometrically Frustrated Pyrochlore Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustrated magnets provide a platform for exploring exotic phases beyond conventional ordering, with potential relevance to functional materials and information technologies. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to map the thermodynamic phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R = Dy, Ho) with three stable magnetic ground-state stable phases: frustrated spin-ice 2 in 2 out (2I2O) phase, frustrated fragmented 3 in 1 out/1 in 3 out (3I1O/1I3O) phase, and antiferromagnetic all in all out (AIAO) phase without frustration. We discovered two additional emergent metastable phases at finite temperatures, located between the boundaries separating those stable phases. These metastable phases exhibit high magnetic susceptibility and high entropy without long-range order. Their stabilization arises from entropic minimization of the free energy, where the entropy dominates energetic competition near phase boundaries at finite temperatures. Our results demonstrate a platform to engineer highly susceptible and degenerated states through frustration and thermal activation, offering a foundation for entropy-based design of metastable phases in correlated systems.</description>

      <title>The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.</description>

      <title>Wannier Functions Dually Localized in Space and Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of Wannier functions from Bloch orbitals offers a unitary freedom that can be exploited to yield Wannier functions with advantageous properties. Minimizing the spatial variance is a well-known choice; another, previously proposed for Wannier functions constructed from the occupied Bloch manifold, minimizes a weighted sum of spatial and energy variance. Departing from all previous work, we extend dual localization to include both valence and conduction bands together. Near the Fermi energy, these dually localized Wannier functions yield frontier (bonding and antibonding) orbitals in bulk silicon and molecular ethylene, as well as $d$-orbital character in metallic copper. Because they are both localized and retain information about the orbital energy spectrum, dually localized Wannier functions are well suited to orbital-dependent methods that associate Wannier functions with specific energy ranges. They naturally induce fractional occupations, allowing for corrections to the DFA total energy.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the spontaneous conversion of layered MAX phases to 2D MXenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topochemically transforming layered non-van der Waals solid into two dimensional (2D) materials involves selective etching reactions with atomic precision. The element-specific, structure-sensitive etching at nanoscale urgently requires in-depth understanding. Here, by means of density functional theory calculations and a laboratory-made operando reaction monitoring platform, the mechanism of instantaneous transforming MAX phase into MXenes is unraveled. The overall etching kinetics exhibits a sigmoidal curve, following self-accelerating reaction character with a small activation energy of ca. 60 kJ/mol. Interestingly, this activation energy corresponds to the Al transport through Ti3C2 slits. Therefore the reaction of Al with hydrofluoric acid solution in the confined interlayer space is recognized as the rate-determining step. Last but not the least, we found that the match of A element and etchants to form stable products is critical for the etching reaction, and reaction energy derived from the thermodynamics provides an easy yet effective descriptor for screening efficient etchants.</description>

      <title>On the Mathematical Foundation of a Decoupled Directional Distortional Hardening Model for Metal Plasticity in the Framework of Rational Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a modification to the yield condition that addresses the mathematical constraints inherent in the Directional Distortional Hardening models developed by Feigenbaum and Dafalias. The modified model resolves both the mathematical inconsistency found in the complete model and the limitations of the r-model. In the complete model, inconsistency arises between the distortional term in the yield surface and the plastic part of the free energy in the absence of kinematic hardening. Additionally, the r-model fails to capture the flattening of the yield surface in the reverse loading direction due to the absence of a fourth-order anisotropic tensor structure in the distortional term. To address these issues, the proposed model introduces a decoupled distortional hardening term in the yield function. This modification enables the simultaneous representation of both flattening and sharpening of the yield surface, and permits isotropic hardening with distortion even without kinematic hardening. A consistent mathematical formulation based on rational mechanics and a corresponding numerical algorithm are also developed, establishing a foundation for future experimental investigations and model validation.</description>

      <title>Tracing Ion Migration in Halide Perovskites with Machine Learned Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Halide perovskite optoelectronic devices suffer from chemical degradation and current-voltage hysteresis induced by migration of highly mobile charged defects. Atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations can capture the motion of these ionic defects, but classical force fields are too inflexible to describe their dynamical charge states. Using CsPbI3 as a case study, we train machine learned force fields from density functional theory calculations and study the diffusion of charged halide interstitial and vacancy defects in bulk CsPbI3. We find that negative iodide interstitials and positive iodide vacancies, the most stable charge states for their respective defect type, migrate at similar rates at room temperature. Neutral interstitials are faster, but neutral vacancies are one order of magnitude slower. Oppositely charged interstitials and vacancies, as they can occur in device operation or reverse bias conditions, are significantly slower and can be considered relatively immobile.</description>

      <title>Heat Transport in Ionic Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the competing effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat capacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This issue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of liquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly important role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport processes. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat transport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of their mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid within the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities which implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial mass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by partial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the heat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with increasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with temperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases monotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom afforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and anions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent but diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this condition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this coherent collective motion to the ``diffusive" phonons that have been used to explain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.</description>

      <title>First-principles theory of nonlinear long-range electron-phonon interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing electron-phonon interactions in a solid requires knowledge of the electron-phonon matrix elements in the Hamiltonian. State-of-the-art first-principles calculations for the electron-phonon interaction are limited to the 1-electron-1-phonon matrix element, which is suitable for harmonic materials. However, there is no first-principles theory for 1-electron-2-phonon interactions, which occur in anharmonic materials with significant electron-phonon interaction such as halide perovskites and quantum paraelectrics. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the long-range part of the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element, written in terms of microscopic quantities that can be calculated from first principles. We show that the long-range 1-electron-2-phonon interaction is described by the derivative of the phonon dynamical matrix with respect to an external electric field. We calculate the quasiparticle energy of a large polaron including 1-electron-2-phonon interaction, and show that it can be written in terms of a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function $\mathcal{T}_{\alpha \beta}(\omega)$. We demonstrate how to calculate this spectral function and its temperature dependence for the benchmark materials LiF and KTaO$_3$, where it turns out that the effect is very small. The first-principles framework developed in this article is general, paving the way for future calculations of 1-electron-2-phonon interactions in materials where the effect may be larger.</description>

      <title>Giant Nonvolatile Multistate Resistance with Fully Magnetically Controlled van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</title>

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Force Fields Reveal Shallow Electronic States on Dynamic Halide Perovskite Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectacular performance of halide perovskites in optoelectronic devices is rooted in their tolerance to defects. Previous studies showed that defects in these materials generate shallow electronic states. However, how these shallow states persist amid the pronounced atomic dynamics on halide perovskite surfaces remains unknown. This work reveals that electronic states at surfaces of prototypical CsPbBr$_3$ are energetically distributed at room temperature akin to well-passivated inorganic semiconductors, even when covalent bonds remain cleaved and undercoordinated. Specifically, a striking tendency for shallow surface states is found with approximately 70% of surface-state energies appearing within 0.2 eV or ${\approx}8k_\text{B}T$ from the valence-band edge. While these findings do not rule out occurrence of deep traps per se, they show that even when surface states appear deeper in the gap, they are not energetically isolated and are less likely to act as traps. We achieve this result by accelerating first-principles calculations via machine learning and show that the unique atomic dynamics in these materials render the formation of deep electronic states at their surfaces unlikely. These findings reveal the microscopic mechanism behind the low density of deep states at dynamic halide perovskite surfaces, which is key to their device performance.</description>

      <title>A silicon spin vacuum: isotopically enriched $^{28}$silicon-on-insulator and $^{28}$silicon from ultra-high fluence ion implantation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring $^{29}$Si which has a non-zero nuclear spin. Ultra-high fluence $^{28}$Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultra-high $^{28}$Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this $^{28}$Si enrichment process to produce $^{28}$Si and $^{28}$Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a $^{28}$Si sample on natural Si substrate with $^{29}$Si depleted to 7~ppm (limited by measurement noise floor), that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and an ultra-high ion fluence, as supported by our improved computational model that is based on fitting a large number of experiments. Further, our model predicts the $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1~ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we do not observe open volume defects in our $^{28}$SOI and $^{28}$Si samples after SPE annealing (620\deg C, 10 minutes).</description>

Abstract: Optical spectra serve as a powerful tool for probing the interactions between materials and light, unveiling complex electronic structures such as flat bands and nontrivial topological features. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of photonic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where understanding the electronic structure directly impacts device performance. Moreover, in anisotropic bulk materials, the optical responses are direction-dependent, and predicting those response tensors still remains computationally demanding due to its inherent complexity and the constraint from crystal symmetry. To address this challenge, we introduce the sequential tensorial properties equivariant neural network (StepENN), a graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full optical tensors across different photon frequencies. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components and anisotropic sequential tensor components into l=0 and l=2 spherical tensor components, StepENN ensures symmetry-aware sequential tensor predictions that are consistent with the inherent symmetry constraints of crystal systems. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors for 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed from first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24.216 millifarads per meter (mF/m) on the predicted tensorial spectra with 85.7% of its predictions exhibiting less than 10% relative error, demonstrating its potential for deriving other spectrum-related properties, such as optical conductivity. This framework opens new avenues for the data-driven design of materials with engineered anisotropic optical responses, accelerating material advances in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Enhancement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction via Field-Cooling-Induced Interface Engineering in 2D van der Waals Ferromagnetic ternary Tellurides</title>

Abstract: The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new avenues for exploring topological spin textures and their applications in next-generation spintronics. Among these materials, Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) emerges as a model system due to its room-temperature skyrmion phases, which are stabilized by strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the atomistic origins of DMI in centrosymmetric vdW lattices remain elusive. Here, we report a spontaneous DMI enhancement mechanism driven by FC in FGaT and its analog Fe3GeTe2 (FGeT). Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have observed the irreversible precipitation of FeTe2 in annealed FGaT. The resulting FeTe2/FGaT heterostructure is considered to break the symmetry and significantly enhance the DMI. Furthermore, similar phenomenon has been observed in the family ferromagnetic material FGeT as well. Additionally, the precipitation of FeTe2 varies significantly with different thicknesses of FGaT, aligning closely with the reported behavior of skyrmions. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms behind the origin of the DMI in ternary tellurides, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases represent arrangements of the plastic slip network with different combinations of collinear, coplanar, non-collinear and non-coplanar active slip systems. Furthermore, some of these phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like activation of secondary slip systems, strain localisation and fracture or amorphisation. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Strain-Gradient and Curvature-Induced Changes in Domain Morphology of BaTiO3 Nanorods: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of OH- ions incorporation on the lattice strain and spontaneous polarization of BaTiO3 nanorods synthesized under different conditions. It was confirmed that the lattice strain depends directly on Ba supersaturation, with higher supersaturation leading to an increase in the lattice strain. However, it was shown that crystal growth and observed lattice distortion are not primarily influenced by external strain; rather, OH- ions incorporation plays a key role in generating internal chemical strains and driving these processes. By using the less reactive TiO2 precursor instead of TiOCl2 and controlling Ba supersaturation, the slower nucleation rate enables more effective regulation of OH- ions incorporation and crystal growth. This in turn effects both particle size and lattice distortion, leading to c/a ratio of 1.013 - 1.014. The incorporation of OH- ions induces lattice elongation along the c-axis, contributing to anisotropic growth, increasing of the rod diameter and their growth-induced bending. However, the possibility of the curvature-induced changes in domain morphology of BaTiO3 nanorods remains almost unexplored. To study the possibility, we perform analytical calculations and finite element modeling, which provide insights into the curvature-induced changes in the strain-gradient, polarization distribution, and domain morphology in BaTiO3 nanorods. Theoretical results reveal the appearance of the domain stripes in BaTiO3 nanorod when the curvature exceeds a critical angle. The physical origin of the domain stripes emergence is the tendency to minimize its elastic energy of the nanorod by the domain splitting. These findings suggest that BaTiO3 nanorods, with curvature-controllable amount of domain stripes, could serve as flexible race-track memory elements for flexo-tronics and domain-wall electronics.</description>

Abstract: We study one- and two-dimensional periodic tight-binding models under the presence of a potential that grows to infinity in one direction, hence preventing the particles to escape in this direction (the soft wall). We prove that a spectral flow appears in these corresponding edge models, as the wall is shifted. We identity this flow as a number of Bloch bands, and provide a lower bound for the number of edge states appearing in such models.</description>

      <title>Vibrational modes as the origin of dielectric loss at 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz in a-SiC:H</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-loss deposited dielectrics are beneficial for the advancement of superconducting integrated circuits for astronomy. In the microwave band ($\mathrm{\sim}$1$\unicode{x2013}$10 GHz) the cryogenic and low-power dielectric loss is dominated by two-level systems. However, the origin of the loss in the millimeter-submillimeter band ($\mathrm{\sim}$0.1$\unicode{x2013}$1 THz) is not understood. We measured the loss of hydrogenated amorphous SiC (a-SiC:H) films in the 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz range using superconducting microstrip resonators and Fourier-transform spectroscopy. The agreement between the loss data and a Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude dispersion model suggests that vibrational modes above 10 THz dominate the loss in the a-SiC:H above 200 GHz.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the potential for spin-triplet superconductivity in molecular beam epitaxy grown PbTe/SnTe semiconductor heterostructures. We present convincing evidence for spin-triplet pairing by soft point-contact spectroscopy experiments, using both spin-polarized and unpolarized electrons and additionally, by detailed analysis of the upper critical field, as inferred from the four probe resistance measurements. The experimental data are described in terms of the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel model of p-wave electron pairing. Our results confirm the predictions on strain-induced topological superconductivity by E.Tang and L. Fu (Nature Physics, 10, 964, 2014).</description>

      <title>Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <title>High-pressure floating zone crystal growth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</description>

Abstract: GaN defect-based quantum emitters show significant potential for quantum information technologies, yet their intrinsic nature is not fully understood. In this work, we present results on the temperature-dependent emission polarization of GaN defect single-photon emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses. The photoluminescence (PL) remains linearly polarized over the temperature range of 10K to 300K, with a slight rotation in the polarization direction observed at intermediate temperatures. Possible mechanisms underlying this behavior are analyzed, and a roadmap for future research is outlined.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces, diffusing independently across pixels and color channels. As a result, they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications involving inherently discrete quantities-such as particle counts or material units-that are constrained by strict conservation laws like mass conservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving particle counts in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve particle conservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across standard image benchmarks, while exactly conditioning total image intensity. We validate DSD on two challenging scientific applications: porous rock microstructures and lithium-ion battery electrodes, demonstrating its ability to generate structurally realistic samples under strict mass conservation constraints, with quantitative evaluation using state-of-the-art metrics for transport and electrochemical performance.</description>
