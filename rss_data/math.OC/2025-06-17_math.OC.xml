      <title>Dual certificates of primal cone membership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss easily verifiable cone membership certificates, that is, certificates proving relations of the form $b\in K$ for convex cones $K$, that consist of vectors in the dual cone $K^*$. Vectors in the dual cone are usually associated with separating hyperplanes, and so they are interpreted as certificates of non-membership in the standard theory of duality. Complementing this, we present constructive certification schemes through which members of the dual cone can be interpreted as primal membership certificates. Every vector in the interior of $K$ is assigned a full-dimensional cone of certificates, making the numerical computation of rigorous certificates easy, provided that the dual cone has an efficiently computable logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier. Of particular interest are cones that are low-dimensional linear images of much higher dimensional cones. In the context of optimization (as opposed to feasibility) problems, these certificates can be used to easily compute, using a closed-form formula, exact primal feasible solutions from suitable dual feasible solutions, with the guarantee that the closer the dual solutions are to optimality, the closer to optimality are the computed primal solutions, too. We demonstrate that the new certification scheme is applicable to virtually every tractable subcone of nonnegative polynomials commonly used in polynomial optimization (such as SOS, SONC, SAGE and SDSOS polynomials, among others), facilitating the computation of rigorous nonnegativity certificates using numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>A New Approach for the Continuous Time Kyle-Back Strategic Insider Equilibrium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a continuous time Kyle-Back model which is a game problem between an insider and a market marker. The existing literature typically focuses on the existence of equilibrium by using the PDE approach, which requires certain Markovian structure and the equilibrium is in the bridge form. We shall provide a new approach which is used widely for stochastic controls and stochastic differential games. We characterize all equilibria through a coupled system of forward backward SDEs, where the forward one is the conditional law of the inside information and the backward one is the insider's optimal value. In particular, when the time duration is small, we show that the FBSDE is wellposed and thus the game has a unique equilibrium. This is the first uniqueness result in the literature, without restricting the equilibria to certain special structure. Moreover, this unique equilibrium may not be Markovian, indicating that the PDE approach cannot work in this case. We next study the set value of the game, which roughly speaking is the set of insider's values over all equilibria and thus is by nature unique. We show that, although the bridge type of equilibria in the literature does not satisfy the required integrability for our equilibria, its truncation serves as a desired approximate equilibrium and its value belongs to our set value. Finally, we characterize our set value through a level set of certain standard HJB equation.</description>

      <title>Monotone and nonmonotone linearized block coordinate descent methods for nonsmooth composite optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce both monotone and nonmonotone variants of LiBCoD, a \textbf{Li}nearized \textbf{B}lock \textbf{Co}ordinate \textbf{D}escent method for solving composite optimization problems. At each iteration, a random block is selected, and the smooth components of the objective are linearized along the chosen block in a Gauss-Newton approach. For the monotone variant, we establish a global sublinear convergence rate to a stationary point under the assumption of bounded iterates. For the nonmonotone variant, we derive a global sublinear convergence rate without requiring global Lipschitz continuity or bounded iterates. Preliminary numerical experiments highlight the promising performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Shuffling SARAH: Advancing Complexity Analysis via Dynamic Gradient Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Adjusted Shuffling SARAH, a novel algorithm that integrates shuffling techniques with the well-known variance-reduced algorithm SARAH while dynamically adjusting the stochastic gradient weights in each update to enhance exploration. Our method achieves the best-known gradient complexity for shuffling variance reduction methods in a strongly convex setting. This result applies to any shuffling technique, which narrows the gap in the complexity analysis of variance reduction methods between uniform sampling and shuffling data. Furthermore, we introduce Inexact Adjusted Reshuffling SARAH, an inexact variant of Adjusted Shuffling SARAH that eliminates the need for full-batch gradient computations. This algorithm retains the same linear convergence rate as Adjusted Shuffling SARAH while showing an advantage in total complexity when the sample size is very large.</description>

      <title>Lagrange multiplier expressions for matrix polynomial optimization and tight relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies matrix constrained polynomial optimization. We investigate how to get explicit expressions for Lagrange multiplier matrices from the first order optimality conditions. The existence of these expressions can be shown under the nondegeneracy condition. Using Lagrange multiplier matrix expressions, we propose a strengthened Moment-SOS hierarchy for solving matrix polynomial optimization. Under some general assumptions, we show that this strengthened hierarchy is tight, or equivalently, it has finite convergence. We also study how to detect tightness and how to extract optimizers. Numerical experiments are provided to show the efficiency of the strengthened hierarchy.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Derivative-free Methods for Linear Quadratic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy optimization has drawn increasing attention in reinforcement learning, particularly in the context of derivative-free methods for linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems with unknown dynamics. This paper focuses on characterizing the robustness of derivative-free methods for solving an infinite-horizon LQR problem. To be specific, we estimate policy gradients by cost values, and study the effect of perturbations on the estimations, where the perturbations may arise from function approximations, measurement noises, etc. We show that under sufficiently small perturbations, the derivative-free methods converge to any pre-specified neighborhood of the optimal policy. Furthermore, we establish explicit bounds on the perturbations, and provide the sample complexity for the perturbed derivative-free methods.</description>

      <title>Glocal Smoothness: Line Search can really help!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iteration complexities for first-order optimization algorithms are typically stated in terms of a global Lipschitz constant of the gradient, and near-optimal results are achieved using fixed step sizes. But many objective functions that arise in practice have regions with small Lipschitz constants where larger step sizes can be used. Many local Lipschitz assumptions have been proposed, which have lead to results showing that adaptive step sizes and/or line searches yield improved convergence rates over fixed step sizes. However, these faster rates tend to depend on the iterates of the algorithm, which makes it difficult to compare the iteration complexities of different methods. We consider a simple characterization of global and local ("glocal") smoothness that only depends on properties of the function. This allows upper bounds on iteration complexities in terms of iterate-independent constants and enables us to compare iteration complexities between algorithms. Under this assumption it is straightforward to show the advantages of line searches over fixed step sizes, and that in some settings, gradient descent with line search has a better iteration complexity than accelerated methods with fixed step sizes. We further show that glocal smoothness can lead to improved complexities for the Polyak and AdGD step sizes, as well other algorithms including coordinate optimization, stochastic gradient methods, accelerated gradient methods, and non-linear conjugate gradient methods.</description>

      <title>Spatial Optimization of Autonomous Vehicle Assignment Based on Distance-Driven Demand and Customer Patience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance road safety. They optimize traffic flow, minimize congestion, and support sustainability through shared mobility and reduced fuel consumption. A key challenge in AV deployment is allocating vehicles to parking lots across regions to meet fluctuating demand. Proper allocation reduces delays, lowers costs, and boosts user satisfaction by ensuring timely vehicle availability. This paper explores the impact of customer wait time patience on AV allocation models, allowing prioritization of ride requests while balancing fleet efficiency and user satisfaction. It also addresses the effectiveness of vehicle pooling in decentralized service areas. We propose a mathematical model integrating vehicle distribution and customer patience to maintain both efficiency and satisfaction. Results show that adding more facilities initially reduces costs, but the benefits diminish with more facilities. Increased customer patience improves inventory pooling benefits, especially when no fixed costs are tied to facility operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method is an effective gradient descent algorithm for solving unconstrained optimization problems. Based on the observation of two classical BB step sizes, by constructing a variational least squares model, we propose a novel class of BB step sizes, each of which still retains the quasi-Newton property, with the original two BB step sizes being their two extreme cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the well-known L-Shaped method to solve two-stage stochastic programming problems with decision-dependent uncertainty. The method is based on a novel, unifying, formulation and on distribution-specific optimality and feasibility cuts for both linear and integer stochastic programs. Extensive tests on three production planning problems illustrate that the method is extremely effective on large-scale instances.</description>

      <title>A bang-bang solution with infinitely many switching points for a parabolic boundary control problem with terminal observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a parabolic boundary control problem with one spatial dimension, control constraints of box type, and an objective function that measures the $L^2$-distance to a desired terminal state. It is shown that, for a certain choice of the desired state, the considered problem possesses an optimal control that is chattering, i.e., of bang-bang type with infinitely many switching points and a positive objective function value. Whether such a solution is possible has been an open question in the literature. We are able to answer this question in the affirmative by means of Fourier analysis and an auxiliary result on the existence of power series with a certain structure and sign-changing behavior. The latter may also be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>LP Relaxations for Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Partial Path Protection: Formulations and Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a variant of the routing and wavelength assignment problem (RWAP), the RWAP with partial path protection (RWAP-PPP) designs a reliable optical-fiber network for telecommunications. It assigns paths and wavelengths to meet communication requests, not only in normal working situations but also in potential failure cases where an optical link fails. The literature lacks efficient relaxations to produce tight lower bounds on the optimal objective value of the RWAP-PPP. Consequently, the solution quality for the RWAP-PPP cannot be properly assessed, which is critical for telecommunication providers in customer bidding and service improvement. Due to numerous failure scenarios, developing effective lower bounds for the RWAP-PPP is challenging. To address this, we formulate and analyze various linear programming (LP) relaxations of the RWAP-PPP. Among them, we propose a novel LP relaxation yielding promising lower bounds. To solve it, we develop a Benders decomposition algorithm with valid inequalities to enhance performance. Computational results on practical networks, including large ones with hundreds of nodes and edges, demonstrate the effectiveness of the LP relaxation and efficiency of its algorithm. The obtained lower bounds achieve average optimality gaps of 8.6%. Compared with a direct LP relaxation of the RWAP, which has average gaps of 36.7%, significant improvements are observed. Consequently, our LP relaxation and algorithm effectively assess RWAP-PPP solution quality, offering significant research and practical value.</description>

      <title>Distributed Composite Optimization with Sub-Weibull Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of multi-agent distributed optimization (MA-DO) theory over the past decade, the distributed stochastic gradient method (DSGM) occupies an important position. Although the theory of different DSGMs has been widely established, the main-stream results of existing work are still derived under the condition of light-tailed stochastic gradient noises. Increasing recent examples from various fields, indicate that, the light-tailed noise model is overly idealized in many practical instances, failing to capture the complexity and variability of noises in real-world scenarios, such as the presence of outliers or extreme values from data science and statistical learning. To address this issue, we propose a new DSGM framework that incorporates stochastic gradients under sub-Weibull randomness. We study a distributed composite stochastic mirror descent scheme with sub-Weibull gradient noise (DCSMD-SW) for solving a distributed composite optimization (DCO) problem over the time-varying multi-agent network. By investigating sub-Weibull randomness in DCSMD for the first time, we show that the algorithm is applicable in common heavy-tailed noise environments while also guaranteeing good convergence properties. We comprehensively study the convergence performance of DCSMD-SW. Satisfactory high probability convergence rates are derived for DCSMD-SW without any smoothness requirement. The work also offers a unified analysis framework for several critical cases of both algorithms and noise environments.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Problem and Weierstrass Necessary Condition for Fractional Calculus of Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary]{In this paper, we study problems of minimization of a functional depending on the fractional Caputo derivative of order $0&lt;\alpha \leq 1$ and the fractional Riemann- Liouville integral of order $\beta &gt; 0$ at fixed endpoints. A fractional analogue of the Du Bois-Reymond lemma is proved, and the Euler-Lagrange conditions are proved for the simplest problem of fractional variational calculus with fixed ends and for the fractional isoperimetric problem. An approach is proposed to obtain the necessary first-order conditions for the strong and weak extrema, and the necessary optimality conditions are obtained. From these necessary conditions, as a consequence, we obtain the Weierstrass condition and its local modification.
  It should be noted that some papers in the literature claim that the standard proof of the Legendre condition in the classical case $\alpha=1$ cannot be adapted to the fractional case $0&lt; \alpha &lt;1$ with final constraints. Despite this, we prove the Legendre conditions by the standard classical method via the Weierstrass condition. In addition, the necessary Weierstrass-Erdmann conditions at the corner points are obtained. Examples are provided to illustrate the significance of the main results obtained.</description>

      <title>Counterexample-Guided Synthesis of Robust Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have gained popularity for training candidate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to satisfy the CBF conditions on a finite set of sampled states. However, since the CBF is unknown a priori, it is unclear which sampled states belong to its zero-superlevel set and must satisfy the CBF conditions, and which ones lie outside it. Existing approaches define a set in which all sampled states are required to satisfy the CBF conditions, thus introducing conservatism. In this paper, we address this issue for robust discrete-time CBFs (R-DTCBFs). Furthermore, we propose a class of R-DTCBFs that can be used in an online optimization problem to synthesize safe controllers for general discrete-time systems with input constraints and bounded disturbances. To train such an R-DTCBF that is valid not only on sampled states but also across the entire region, we employ a verification algorithm iteratively in a counterexample-guided approach. We apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Acceleration Without Strong Convexity Priors Or Restarts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated optimization methods are typically parametrized by the Lipschitz smoothness and strong convexity parameters of a given problem, which are rarely known in practice. While the Lipschitz smoothness parameter L can be easily estimated by backtracking, directly estimating (i.e., without restarts) the strong convexity parameter m remains an open problem. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing NAG-free, an optimization method that achieves acceleration while estimating m online without priors or restarts. Our method couples Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) method with an inexpensive estimator that does not require additional computation, only storage of one more iterate and gradient. We prove that in the canonical setting of the open problem, NAG-free converges globally at least as fast as gradient descent and locally at an accelerated rate, without resorting to m priors or restarts. We also introduce a complementary estimator for L, symmetric to the m estimator. We provide extensive empirical evidence that this NAG-free heuristic with L and m estimators often achieves acceleration in practice, outperforming restart schemes and traditional accelerated methods parametrized by offline estimates of L and m. Our experiments also suggest that NAG-free might be effective even for nonconvex problems when combined with restarts.</description>

      <title>Fare Game: A Mean Field Model of Stochastic Intensity Control in Dynamic Ticket Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing of discrete goods over a finite selling horizon. One way to capture both the elastic and stochastic reaction of purchases to price is through a model where sellers control the intensity of a counting process, representing the number of sales thus far. The intensity describes the probabilistic likelihood of a sale, and is a decreasing function of the price a seller sets. A classical model for ticket pricing, which assumes a single seller and infinite time horizon, is by Gallego and van Ryzin (1994) and it has been widely utilized by airlines, for instance. Extending to more realistic settings where there are multiple sellers, with finite inventories, in competition over a finite time horizon is more complicated both mathematically and computationally. We introduce a dynamic mean field game of this type, and some numerical and existence results. In particular, we analyze the associated coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov differential-difference equations, and we prove the existence and uniqueness results under certain conditions. Then, we demonstrate a numerical algorithm to find this solution and provide some insights into the macroeconomic market parameters. Finally, we present a preliminary comparison of our findings with airfare data.</description>

      <title>Research on Optimal Control Problem Based on Reinforcement Learning under Knightian Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering that the decision-making environment faced by reinforcement learning (RL) agents is full of Knightian uncertainty, this paper describes the exploratory state dynamics equation in Knightian uncertainty to study the entropy-regularized relaxed stochastic control problem in a Knightian uncertainty environment. By employing stochastic analysis theory and the dynamic programming principle under nonlinear expectation, we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and solve for the optimal policy that achieves a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Subsequently, for the linear-quadratic (LQ) case, we examine the agent's optimal randomized feedback control under both state-dependent and state-independent reward scenarios, proving that the optimal randomized feedback control follows a Gaussian distribution in the LQ framework. Furthermore, we investigate how the degree of Knightian uncertainty affects the variance of the optimal feedback policy. Additionally, we establish the solvability equivalence between non-exploratory and exploratory LQ problems under Knightian uncertainty and analyze the associated exploration cost. Finally, we provide an LQ example and validate the theoretical findings through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Restarted contractive operators to learn at equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization offers a methodology to learn hyperparameters in imaging inverse problems, yet its integration with automatic differentiation techniques remains challenging. On the one hand, inverse problems are typically solved by iterating arbitrarily many times some elementary scheme which maps any point to the minimizer of an energy functional, known as equilibrium point. On the other hand, introducing parameters to be learned in the energy functional yield architectures very reminiscent of Neural Networks (NN) known as Unrolled NN and thus suggests the use of Automatic Differentiation (AD) techniques. Yet, applying AD requires for the NN to be of relatively small depth, thus making necessary to truncate an unrolled scheme to a finite number of iterations. First, we show that, at the minimizer, the optimal gradient descent step computed in the Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) framework admits an approximation, known as Jacobian Free Backpropagation (JFB), that is much easier to compute and can be made arbitrarily good by controlling Lipschitz properties of the truncated unrolled scheme. Second, we introduce an algorithm that combines a restart strategy with JFB computed by AD and we show that the learned steps can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal DEQ framework. Third, we complement the theoretical analysis by applying the proposed method to a variety of problems in imaging that progressively depart from the theoretical framework. In particular we show that this method is effective for training weights in weighted norms; stepsizes and regularization levels of Plug-and-Play schemes; and a DRUNet denoiser embedded in Forward-Backward iterates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of mixed-variable problems remains a significant challenge. We propose an extension of the policy-based optimization method that handles mixed-variables problems in a natural way, through a simple policy combination. This is achieved by independently sampling from a multivariate normal distribution for the continuous domain, and from multiple categorical distributions for the discrete choices. Results demonstrate that the agent successfully yields high-quality solutions on a classical problem of electromagnetics, showcasing its robustness.</description>

      <title>Using Model Predictive Control To Reduce Traffic Emissions on Urban Freeways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic congestion significantly impacts regional air quality and contributes substantially to pollutant emissions. Suburban freeway corridors are a major source of traffic-related emissions, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework aimed at emission reduction on peripheral freeway corridors. Emission rates on freeways exhibit high sensitivity to speed fluctuations and congestion recovery processes. To address this relationship, we develop and analyze a bounded-acceleration continuum traffic flow model. By introducing an upper limit on vehicle acceleration capabilities, we enhance behavioral realism through the incorporation of driver responses to congestion, which is widely recognized as a main cause of the important capacity drop phenomenon. Our approach implements dynamically optimized variable speed limits (VSLs) at strategic corridor locations, balancing the dual objectives of minimizing both travel time and emissions as quantified by the COPERT V [1] model. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this framework effectively manages congestion and reduces emissions across various traffic demand scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Relaxation Framework for Global Solution of ACOPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) problem to global optimality remains challenging due to its nonconvex quadratic constraints. In this paper, we present a unified framework that combines static piecewise relaxations with dynamic cut-generation mechanism to systematically tighten the classic Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) relaxation to arbitrarily small conic violation, thus enabling the recovery of globally optimal solutions. Two static formulations, Pyramidal Relaxation (PR) and Quasi-Pyramidal Relaxation (QPR), are introduced to tighten each branch-flow second-order cone via a finite union of wedges, providing controllable accuracy. Their dynamic counterparts, Dynamic PR (DPR) and Dynamic QPR (DQPR), embed on-the-fly cut generation within a branch-and-cut solver to improve scalability. Convergence is further accelerated through warm starts and a lightweight local-search post-processing. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate effective elimination of conic violations and flexible trade-offs between solution accuracy and runtime. Practical guidelines are derived for selecting appropriate variants based on network size and accuracy requirements.</description>

      <title>Balancing Intensity and Focality in Directional DBS Under Uncertainty: A Simulation Study of Electrode Optimization via a Metaheuristic L1L1 Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As DBS technology advances toward directional leads and optimization-based current steering, this study aims to improve the selection of electrode contact configurations using the recently developed L1-norm regularized L1-norm fitting (L1L1) method. The focus is in particular on L1L1's capability to incorporate a priori lead field uncertainty, offering a potential advantage over conventional approaches that do not account for such variability. Our optimization framework incorporates uncertainty by constraining the solution space based on lead field attenuation. This reflects physiological expectations about the VTA and serves to avoid overfitting. By applying this method to 8- and 40-contact electrode configurations, we optimize current distributions within a discretized finite element (FE) model, focusing on the lead field's characteristics. The model accounts for uncertainty through these explicit constraints, enhancing the feasibility, focality, and robustness of the resulting solutions. The L1L1 method was validated through a series of numerical experiments using both noiseless and noisy lead fields, where the noise level was selected to reflect attenuation within VTA. It successfully fits and regularizes the current distribution across target structures, with hyperparameter optimization extracting either bipolar or multipolar electrode configurations. These configurations aim to maximize focused current density or prioritize a high gain field ratio in a discretized FE model. Compared to traditional methods, the L1L1 approach showed competitive performance in concentrating stimulation within the target region while minimizing unintended current spread, particularly under noisy conditions. By incorporating uncertainty directly into the optimization process, we obtain a noise-robust framework for current steering, allowing for variations in lead field models and simulation parameters.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Normalized Smoothness for Optimization with Approximate Hessians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop new optimization algorithms that use approximate second-order information combined with the gradient regularization technique to achieve fast global convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives. The key innovation of our analysis is a novel notion called Gradient-Normalized Smoothness, which characterizes the maximum radius of a ball around the current point that yields a good relative approximation of the gradient field. Our theory establishes a natural intrinsic connection between Hessian approximation and the linearization of the gradient. Importantly, Gradient-Normalized Smoothness does not depend on the specific problem class of the objective functions, while effectively translating local information about the gradient field and Hessian approximation into the global behavior of the method. This new concept equips approximate second-order algorithms with universal global convergence guarantees, recovering state-of-the-art rates for functions with H\"older-continuous Hessians and third derivatives, quasi-self-concordant functions, as well as smooth classes in first-order optimization. These rates are achieved automatically and extend to broader classes, such as generalized self-concordant functions. We demonstrate direct applications of our results for global linear rates in logistic regression and softmax problems with approximate Hessians, as well as in non-convex optimization using Fisher and Gauss-Newton approximations.</description>

      <title>Understanding Lookahead Dynamics Through Laplace Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-domain framework for convergence analysis of hyperparameters in game optimization, leveraging High-Resolution Differential Equations (HRDEs) and Laplace transforms. Focusing on the Lookahead algorithm--characterized by gradient steps $k$ and averaging coefficient $\alpha$--we transform the discrete-time oscillatory dynamics of bilinear games into the frequency domain to derive precise convergence criteria. Our higher-precision $O(\gamma^2)$-HRDE models yield tighter criteria, while our first-order $O(\gamma)$-HRDE models offer practical guidance by prioritizing actionable hyperparameter tuning over complex closed-form solutions. Empirical validation in discrete-time settings demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which may further extend to locally linear operators, offering a scalable framework for selecting hyperparameters for learning in games.</description>

      <title>Is your batch size the problem? Revisiting the Adam-SGD gap in language modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adam is known to perform significantly better than Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in language models, a phenomenon for which a number of explanations have been proposed. In this work, we revisit this "optimizer gap" through a series of comprehensively tuned baseline training runs for language modeling with Transformers. We exhaustively study how momentum, gradient clipping, and batch size affect the gap between SGD and Adam. Our empirical findings show that SGD with momentum can actually perform similarly to Adam in small-batch settings, if tuned correctly. We revisit existing explanations for Adam's advantage, including heavy-tailed class imbalance, directional sharpness, and Hessian heterogeneity, which struggle to directly explain this phenomenon. Towards bridging this gap in our understanding, by analyzing our Transformer training runs and simple quadratic settings inspired by the literature, we provide new insights, driven by stochastic differential equation models, into the role of batch size on the training dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel iterative scheme for restoring uneven illumination in grayscale images. Our approach solves, at each global iteration, a nonlinear elliptic equation for an auxiliary field $u$ and then updates the illumination via an explicit time-marching step driven by the logarithmic potential of $u$. We establish existence and uniqueness of the discrete subproblems, analyze convergence of the fixed point iteration, and demonstrate performance on standard test images, reporting PSNR and SSIM gains over classical methods. Future work will address color coupling and GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>DR-SAC: Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic for Reinforcement Learning under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success, yet its application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by a lack of robustness to environmental uncertainties. To solve this challenge, some robust RL algorithms have been proposed, but most are limited to tabular settings. In this work, we propose Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic (DR-SAC), a novel algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore, experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses online learning with ``corrupted'' feedback. Our learner is provided with potentially corrupted gradients $\tilde g_t$ instead of the ``true'' gradients $g_t$. We make no assumptions about how the corruptions arise: they could be the result of outliers, mislabeled data, or even malicious interference. We focus on the difficult ``unconstrained'' setting in which our algorithm must maintain low regret with respect to any comparison point $u \in \mathbb{R}^d$. The unconstrained setting is significantly more challenging as existing algorithms suffer extremely high regret even with very tiny amounts of corruption (which is not true in the case of a bounded domain). Our algorithms guarantee regret $ \|u\|G (\sqrt{T} + k) $ when $G \ge \max_t \|g_t\|$ is known, where $k$ is a measure of the total amount of corruption. When $G$ is unknown we incur an extra additive penalty of $(\|u\|^2+G^2) k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction (reduction of FLOPS). Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Activator Solutions for Geopolymer Synthesis: Thermochemical Stability, Sequencing, and Standardisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geopolymers present a sustainable alternative to conventional binders, however, their commercial viability is hindered by a lack of standardised methods for preparing stabile activator solutions; alkaline feedstocks critical to geopolymer synthesis. This study presents a combined experimental and modelling approach to evaluate the thermochemical stability, solubility constraints, and silica speciation behaviour of sodium silicate-based activators. Using quantitative 29Si NMR analysis, thermodynamic stability and three-dimensional solubility modelling, this research identifies optimal preparation conditions that minimise irreversible precipitation risks and optimises mixing periods. Key findings indicate that higher solution temperatures associated with optimised activator solution preparation were found to enhance thermochemical stability and reactivity, while cooling increased viscosity and the likelihood of unstable solution behaviour, which may necessitate discarding. The order in which feedstocks are combined directly affects whether the solution becomes unstable, with an optimal sequence of water, alkali-hydroxide, soluble silicate found to ensure greater process reliability. A predictive model and accompanying visual tools enable practitioners to assess solution viability and define stability windows by quantifying initial and final/unstable periods and temperatures based on feedstock composition and solution temperature. These results contribute to improved reproducibility and quality control in geopolymer research and represent a step toward developing standard operating procedures for activator solution synthesis.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Bilevel Optimization: Efficient Algorithms with Near-Optimal Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization, in which one optimization problem is nested inside another, underlies many machine learning applications with a hierarchical structure -- such as meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization. Such applications often involve sensitive training data, raising pressing concerns about individual privacy. Motivated by this, we study differentially private bilevel optimization. We first focus on settings where the outer-level objective is \textit{convex}, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the excess risk for both pure and approximate differential privacy, covering both empirical and population-level loss. These bounds are nearly tight and essentially match the optimal rates for standard single-level differentially private ERM and stochastic convex optimization (SCO), up to additional terms that capture the intrinsic complexity of the nested bilevel structure. The bounds are achieved in polynomial time via efficient implementations of the exponential and regularized exponential mechanisms. A key technical contribution is a new method and analysis of log-concave sampling under inexact function evaluations, which may be of independent interest. In the \textit{non-convex} setting, we develop novel algorithms with state-of-the-art rates for privately finding approximate stationary points. Notably, our bounds do not depend on the dimension of the inner problem.</description>

      <title>Federated ADMM from Bayesian Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ADMM is a popular method for federated deep learning which originated in the 1970s and, even though many new variants of it have been proposed since then, its core algorithmic structure has remained unchanged. Here, we take a major departure from the old structure and present a fundamentally new way to derive and extend federated ADMM. We propose to use a structure called Bayesian Duality which exploits a duality of the posterior distributions obtained by solving a variational-Bayesian reformulation of the original problem. We show that this naturally recovers the original ADMM when isotropic Gaussian posteriors are used, and yields non-trivial extensions for other posterior forms. For instance, full-covariance Gaussians lead to Newton-like variants of ADMM, while diagonal covariances result in a cheap Adam-like variant. This is especially useful to handle heterogeneity in federated deep learning, giving up to 7% accuracy improvements over recent baselines. Our work opens a new Bayesian path to improve primal-dual methods.</description>

      <title>Faithful-Newton Framework: Bridging Inner and Outer Solvers for Enhanced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Newton-type methods are known for their fast local convergence and strong empirical performance, achieving theoretically favorable global convergence compared to first-order methods remains a key challenge. For instance, surprisingly, for simple strongly convex problems, no straightforward variant of Newton's method matches the global complexity of gradient descent. Although sophisticated variants can improve iteration complexity over gradient descent for various problems, they often involve highly nontrivial subproblems that incur significantly higher per-iteration costs, resulting in a much worse overall operation complexity. These limitations arise from treating the subproblem as an afterthought, either by handling it as a black box, thus permitting complex, highly nontrivial, and nearly unimplementable formulations, or by evaluating subproblem solutions in isolation, without considering their effectiveness in advancing the optimization of the main objective. By tightening the integration between the inner iterations of the subproblem solver and the outer iterations of the optimization algorithm, we introduce simple Newton-type variants, called Faithful-Newton methods, which, in a sense, remain faithful to the overall simplicity of classical Newton's method by retaining simple linear system subproblems. The key conceptual difference, however, is that the quality of the subproblem solution is directly assessed based on its effectiveness in reducing optimality, which in turn enables desirable convergence complexities across a variety of settings. Under standard assumptions, we show that our variants match the worst-case complexity of gradient descent in strongly convex settings, both in iteration and operation complexity, and achieve competitive iteration complexity for general convex problems.</description>

      <title>An Explainable and Interpretable Composite Indicator Based on Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite indicators are widely used to score or classify units evaluated on multiple criteria. Their construction involves aggregating criteria evaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In MCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple criteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the degree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential interactions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is essential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well as the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing explainable and interpretable composite indicators using "if..., then..." decision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of composite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical scores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal qualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into quantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in the form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is constructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units results from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision rules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the class assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected indicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale. Moreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units of interest.</description>

      <title>The impact of uncertainty on regularized learning in games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how randomness and uncertainty influence learning in games. Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics of "follow-the-regularized-leader" (FTRL), where the players' payoff observations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks. Our findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, "uncertainty favors extremes": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's trajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy in finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not ultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some (possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question of which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under uncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics under uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies is stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies. Finally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such as zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness disrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the boundary on average.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Layered Decoding Scheduling for LDPC Codes Aided by Check Node Error Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a new scheduling strategies for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under layered belief propagation (LBP) is designed. Based on the criteria of prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error probabilities, we propose two dynamic scheduling methods: dynamic error belief propagation (Dyn-EBP) and dynamic penalty error belief propagation (Dyn-PEBP). In Dyn-EBP, each check node is restricted from being updated the same number of times, whereas Dyn-PEBP removes this restriction and instead introduces a penalty term to balance the number of updates. Simulation results show that, for 5G new radio (NR) LDPC codes, our proposed scheduling methods can outperform existing dynamic and offline scheduling strategies under various blocklengths and code rates. This demonstrates that prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error probabilities can lead to higher decoding efficiency and validates the effectiveness of our algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In technical communique, we develop a graphical design procedure for reset controllers for unstable LTI plants based on recent developments on Scaled Relative Graph analysis, yielding an $L_2$-gain performance bound. The stabilizing controller consists of a second order reset element in parallel with a proportional gain. The proposed method goes beyond existing approaches that are limited to stable systems only, providing a well-applicable approach to design problems in practice where the plant is unstable.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Adjoint-Optimized Neural PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks. The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent optimization method for training neural-network PDE models in the limit where both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity. Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to (1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit). The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Nonlinear Regulator with Concurrent Uncertainties in Exosystems and Control Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-adaptive control solution framework to the practical output regulation problem (PORP) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters, unknown control directions and uncertain exosystem dynamics. The concurrence of the unknown control directions and uncertainties in both the system dynamics and the exosystem pose a significant challenge to the problem. In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, both the estimation and tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.</description>

      <title>Boosting Column Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03692v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</description>

      <title>Mean uniformly stable function and its application to almost sure stability analysis of randomly switched time-varying systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates uniform almost sure stability of randomly switched time-varying systems. Mode-dependent indefinite multiple Lyapunov functions (iMLFs) are introduced to assess stability properties of diverse time-varying subsystems. To realize the stability conditions establishment based on iMLFs, we present a novel condition so-called mean uniformly stable function for time-varying parameters of iMLFs' derivatives. Our approach provides a probabilistic perspective, making iMLFs well-suited for randomly switched time-varying systems. Moreover, the MUSF condition reveals an essential insight: ensuring that each time-varying subsystem remains mean-bounded during its corresponding sojourn time interval is a prerequisite for the almost sure stability of the entire system. Additionally, the combination of iMLFs and MUSFs is able to accommodate stability analysis scenarios where some subsystems are unstable or exhibit non-exponential decay. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notions of $\lambda$-cent-dian and generalized-center from Facility Location Theory to the more intricate domain of Network Design. Our focus is on the task of designing a sub-network within a given underlying network while adhering to a budget constraint. This sub-network is intended to efficiently serve a collection of origin/destination pairs of demand.
  The $\lambda$-cent-dian problem studies the balance between efficiency and equity. We investigate the properties of the $\lambda$-cent-dian and generalized-center solution networks under the lens of equity, efficiency, and Pareto-optimality. We finally prove that the problems solved here are NP-hard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability for parabolic SPDEs involving both the state and the gradient of the state. To start with, an improved global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with general random coefficients and square-integrable source terms is derived. Based on this, we further develop a new global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with source terms in the Sobolev space of negative order, which enables us to deal with the global null controllability for linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs with gradient terms. As a byproduct, a special energy-type estimate for the controlled system that explicitly depends on the parameters $\lambda,\mu$ and the weighted function $\theta$ is obtained, which makes it possible for extending the linear controllability to semi-linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study zeroth-order algorithms for nonconvex minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under the deterministic and stochastic settings, which have attracted wide attention in machine learning, signal processing and many other fields in recent years, e.g., adversarial attacks in resource allocation problems and network flow problems etc. We propose two single-loop algorithms, namely the zeroth-order primal-dual alternating projected gradient (ZO-PDAPG) algorithm and the zeroth-order regularized momentum primal-dual projected gradient algorithm (ZO-RMPDPG), for solving deterministic and stochastic nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems with coupled linear constraints. The iteration complexity of the two proposed algorithms to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point are proved to be $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon ^{-2})$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon ^{-4})$) for solving nonconvex-strongly concave (resp. nonconvex-concave) minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under deterministic settings and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon ^{-3})$ (resp. $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon ^{-6.5})$) under stochastic settings respectively. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first two zeroth-order algorithms with iterative complexity guarantees for solving nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under the deterministic and stochastic settings.</description>

      <title>Output Feedback Periodic Event-Triggered and Self-Triggered Boundary Control of Coupled $2\times 2$ Linear Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02298v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand recently introduced observer-based periodic event-triggered control (PETC) and self-triggered control (STC) schemes for reaction-diffusion PDEs to boundary control of $2\times2$ coupled hyperbolic PDEs in canonical form and with anti-collocated measurement and actuation processes. The class of problem under study governs transport phenomena arising in water management systems, oil drilling, and traffic flow, to name a few. Relative to the state of the art in observer-based event-triggered control of hyperbolic PDEs, our contribution goes two steps further by proposing observer-based PETC and STC for the considered class of systems. These designs arise from a non-trivial redesign of an existing continuous-time event-triggered control (CETC) scheme. PETC and STC eliminate the need for constant monitoring of an event-triggering function as in CETC; PETC requires only periodic evaluations of the triggering function for event detection, whereas STC is a predictor-feedback that anticipates the next event time at the current event exploiting continuously accessible output measurements. The introduced resource-aware designs act as input holding mechanisms allowing for the update of the input signal only at events. Subject to the designed boundary output feedback PETC and STC control laws characterized by a set of event-trigger design parameters, the resulting closed-loop systems, which are inherently Zeno-free by design, achieve exponential convergence to zero in the spatial $L^2$ norm. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach by applying the control laws to the linearized Saint-Venant model, which describes the dynamics of shallow water waves in a canal and is used to design flow stabilizer feedback laws via gate actuation. The provided simulation results illustrate the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Optimisation models for the design of multiple self-consumption loops in semi-rural areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective electricity self-consumption gains increasing interest in a context where localised consumption of energy is a lever of sustainable development. While easing energy distribution networks, collective self-consumption requires complementary prosumers' profiles. Before determining the proper energy exchanges happening between these prosumers, one must ensure their compatibility in the context of collective self-consumption. Motivated by real use cases from a solar power producer, this article proposes network flow-based linear models to solve both the design aspect of the problem and the attribution of distribution flows between the involved prosumers. Two main models are proposed, handling (i) single collective self-consumption loop creation and (ii) multiple loop creation. One of the objectives of this work is to provide models that can be applied at a strategic level which implies their extension to large time scale and large spatial scale. To do so, associated Benders and Dantzig-Wolfe decompositions are proposed to ensure model scalability along temporal and spatial dimensions. The proposed models are tested on realistic use cases to assess their performances.</description>

      <title>Advancing Strategic Planning and Dynamic Control of Complex Projects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strategic project planning and dynamic control are essential to ensure that complex projects are executed in a best-fit-for-common-purpose manner. When such strategies become inconceivable for humans, effective and efficient computer-aided decision support becomes crucial. Standard simulation-driven evaluation and a-posteriori decision-making are often used, rather than a combined simulation and optimisation approach that a-priori integrates the stakeholder interests and risk management. However, current planning and control methodologies often lack stochastic representation and/or associative multi-objective optimisation approaches within socio-technical reach. This paper introduces Odycon (Open design and dynamic control), a new purpose-driven project management by design methodology that resolves these shortcomings. A generic mathematical project planning and control statement is developed to integrate and represent both stakeholders preferences (human domain) and project system performances (technical domain) for effective project planning and dynamic control. Odycon integrates Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) with the Integrative Maximisation of Aggregated Preferences (IMAP) optimisation method to develop a best-fit strategic plan and dynamic control measures. Its value is demonstrated through applications in offshore wind installation and a highway infrastructure projects, showcasing advances in associative design and decision-making, and aiming for a best-fit-for-common purpose synthesis across different complex project phases.</description>

      <title>Continuous Relaxation of Discontinuous Shrinkage Operator: Proximal Inclusion and Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a principled way of deriving a continuous relaxation of a given discontinuous shrinkage operator, which is based on two fundamental results, proximal inclusion and conversion. Using our results, the discontinuous operator is converted, via double inversion, to a continuous operator; more precisely, the associated ``set-valued'' operator is converted to a ``single-valued'' Lipschitz continuous operator. The first illustrative example is the firm shrinkage operator which can be derived as a continuous relaxation of the hard shrinkage operator. We also derive a new operator as a continuous relaxation of the discontinuous shrinkage operator associated with the so-called reversely ordered weighted L1 (ROWL) penalty. Numerical examples demonstrate potential advantages of the continuous relaxation.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the speed of convergence in nonsmooth optimization via the Goldstein subdifferential with application to descent methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Goldstein $\varepsilon$-subdifferential is a relaxed version of the Clarke subdifferential which has recently appeared in several algorithms for nonsmooth optimization. With it comes the notion of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-critical points, which are points in which the element with the smallest norm in the $\varepsilon$-subdifferential has norm at most $\delta$. To obtain points that are critical in the classical sense, $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ must vanish. In this article, we analyze at which speed the distance of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-critical points to the minimum vanishes with respect to $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$. Afterwards, we apply our results to gradient sampling methods and perform numerical experiments. Throughout the article, we put a special emphasis on supporting the theoretical results with simple examples that visualize them.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Gradient Norm Regularization Second-Order Algorithms for Solving Nonconvex-Strongly Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, which have attracted much attention in recent years in many fields, especially in machine learning.We propose a gradient norm regularized trust-region (GRTR) algorithm to solve nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, where the objective function of the trust-region subproblem in each iteration uses a regularized version of the Hessian matrix, and the regularization coefficient and the radius of the ball constraint are proportional to the square root of the gradient norm. The iteration complexity of the proposed GRTR algorithm to obtain an $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point is proved to be upper bounded by $\tilde{O}(\ell^{1.5}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-1.5}\epsilon^{-1.5})$, where $\mu$ is the strong concave coefficient, $\ell$ and $\rho$ are the Lipschitz constant of the gradient and Jacobian matrix respectively, which matches the best known iteration complexity of second-order methods for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems. We further propose a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with a gradient norm regularization coefficient and use the negative curvature direction to correct the iteration direction (LMNegCur), which does not need to solve the trust-region subproblem at each iteration. We also prove that the LMNegCur algorithm achieves an $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point within $\tilde{O}(\ell^{1.5}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-1.5}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ number of iterations.The inexact variants of both algorithms can still obtain $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary points with high probability, but only require $\tilde{O}(\ell^{2.25}\rho^{0.25}\mu^{-1.75}\epsilon^{-1.75})$ Hessian-vector products and $\tilde{O}(\ell^{2}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-2}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ gradient ascent steps.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Settling Time of Finite-Time Stable Systems using Sum of Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-time stability (FTS) of a differential equation guarantees that solutions reach a given equilibrium point in finite time, where the time of convergence depends on the initial state of the system. For traditional stability notions such as exponential stability, the convex optimization framework of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) enables computation of polynomial Lyapunov functions to certify stability. However, finite-time stable systems are characterized by non-Lipschitz, non-polynomial vector fields, rendering standard SoS methods inapplicable. To this end, we show that computation of a non-polynomial Lyapunov function certifying finite-time stability can be reformulated as feasibility of a set of polynomial inequalities under a particular transformation. As a result, SoS can be utilized to verify FTS and obtain a bound on the settling time. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the conditions in both certifying finite-time stability and bounding the settling time.</description>

      <title>Extending the Leader-First Follower Structure for Bearing-only Formation Control on Directed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes an extension to the leader-first follower (LFF) class of graphs used to solve the bearing-only formation control problem over directed graphs. The first contribution provides an equilibrium, stability, and convergence analysis for a one-follower, multi-leader system (which is not an LFF graph). We then propose an extension to the LFF structure, termed \emph{ordered} LFF graphs, that allows for additional forward directed edges to be included. Using the results of the one-follower multi-leader system we show that the ordered LFF graphs can be used to solve the directed bearing-only formation control problem. We also show that these structures offer improved convergence speed as compared to the LFF graphs. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Blackwell's celebrated approachability problem which considers a repeated vector-valued game between a player and an adversary. Motivated by settings in which the action set of the player or adversary (or both) is difficult to optimize over, for instance when it corresponds to the set of all possible solutions to some NP-Hard optimization problem, we ask what can the player guarantee \textit{efficiently}, when only having access to these sets via approximation algorithms with ratios $\alpha_{\mX} \geq 1$ and $ 1 \geq \alpha_{\mY} &gt; 0$, respectively. Assuming the player has monotone preferences, in the sense that he does not prefer a vector-valued loss $\ell_1$ over $\ell_2$ if $\ell_2 \leq \ell_1$, we establish that given a Blackwell instance with an approachable target set $S$, the downward closure of the appropriately-scaled set $\alpha_{\mX}\alpha_{\mY}^{-1}S$ is \textit{efficiently} approachable with optimal rate. In case only the player's or adversary's set is equipped with an approximation algorithm, we give simpler and more efficient algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of boundary delay equations, establishing a unified framework for analyzing dynamical systems with pure time-delayed boundary conditions. We establish mild sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions. Furthermore, we derive spectral criteria for exponential stability. The conditions on the perturbation generalize well-known criteria for the generation of domain perturbations of positive semigroups generators. As an application, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of positive hyperbolic systems with time-delayed boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the problem of selecting a satellite system architecture considering commercial on-orbit refueling (OOR). This problem answers two questions: "What design lifetime should the satellite have?" and "How much propellant should be carried at launch?" We formulate this as a mathematical optimization problem by adopting design lifetime and initial propellant mass as design variables and considering two objective functions to balance the returns and risks. To solve this problem, we develop a surrogate model-based framework grounded in a satellite lifecycle simulation. The framework captures various uncertainties and operational flexibility, and integrates a modified satellite sizing and cost model by adjusting traditional models with OOR. Based on the developed framework, we conduct a case study of GEO communication satellites to examine current target service performance and explore the potential of a new system architecture that diverges from traditional design trends.</description>

      <title>Batch Sample-wise Stochastic Optimal Control via Stochastic Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic optimal control problem (SOC) mainly from the probabilistic view point, i.e. via the Stochastic Maximum principle (SMP) \cite{Peng4}. We adopt the sample-wise backpropagation scheme proposed in \cite{Hui1} to solve the SOC problem under the strong convexity assumption. Importantly, in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure, we use batch samples with higher order scheme in the forward SDE to improve the convergence rate in \cite{Hui1} from $\sim \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{N}{K} + \frac{1}{N}})$ to $\sim \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{K} + \frac{1}{N^2}})$ and note that the main source of uncertainty originates from the scheme for the simulation of $Z$ term in the BSDE. In the meantime, we note the SGD procedure uses only the necessary condition of the SMP, while the batch simulation of the approximating solution of BSDEs allows one to obtain a more accurate estimate of the control $u$ that minimizes the Hamiltonian. We then propose a damped contraction algorithm to solve the SOC problem whose proof of convergence for a special case is attained under some appropriate assumption. We then show numerical results to check the first order convergence rate of the projection algorithm and analyze the convergence behavior of the damped contraction algorithm. Lastly, we briefly discuss how to incorporate the proposed scheme in solving practical problems especially when the Randomized Neural Networks are used. We note that in this special case, the error backward propagation can be avoided and parameter update can be achieved via purely algebraic computation (vector algebra) which will potentially improve the efficiency of the whole training procedure. Such idea will require further exploration and we will leave it as our future work.</description>

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has led to a surge of customizable mobility demand in urban areas, which makes on-demand services increasingly popular. On-demand services are flexible while reducing the need for private cars, thus mitigating congestion and parking issues in limited urban space. While the coordination of high-capacity ridepooling on-demand service requires effective control to ensure efficiency, the emergence of the paradigm of robo-taxi opens the opportunity for centralized fleet control for an improved service quality. In this work, we propose two acceleration algorithms for the most advanced large-scale high-capacity algorithm proposed in [1]. We prove the improvement in the real-time performance of the algorithm by using real-world on-demand data from Manhattan, NYC.</description>

      <title>Mode-Prefix-Based Control of Switched Linear Systems with Applications to Fault Tolerance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of designing prefix-based optimal controllers for switched linear systems over finite horizons. This problem arises in fault-tolerant control, when system faults result in abrupt changes in dynamics. We consider a class of mode-prefix-based linear controllers that depend only on the history of the switching signal. The proposed optimal control problems seek to minimize both expected performance and worst-case performance over switching signals. We show that this problem can be reduced to a convex optimization problem. To this end, we synthesize one controller for each switching signal under a prefix constraint that ensures consistency between controllers. Then, system level synthesis is used to obtain a convex program in terms of the system-level parameters. In particular, it is shown that the prefix constraints are linear in terms of the system-level parameters. Finally, we apply this framework for optimal control of a fighter jet model suffering from system faults, illustrating how fault tolerance is ensured.</description>

      <title>A model-free approach to control barrier functions using funnel control</title>

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular approach to design feedback laws that achieve safety guarantees for nonlinear systems. The CBF-based controller design relies on the availability of a model to select feasible inputs from the set of CBF-based controls. In this paper, we develop a model-free approach to design CBF-based control laws, eliminating the need for knowledge of system dynamics or parameters. Specifically, we address safety requirements characterized by a time-varying distance to a reference trajectory in the output space and construct a CBF that depends only on the measured output. Utilizing this particular CBF, we determine a subset of CBF-based controls without relying on a model of the dynamics by using techniques from funnel control. The latter is a model-free high-gain adaptive control methodology, which achieves tracking guarantees via reactive feedback. In this paper, we discover and establish a connection between the modular controller synthesis via zeroing CBFs and model-free reactive feedback. The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimal Control of Thermal Environment in Pig Houses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The management of thermal environments in pig farming is crucial for optimizing animal health, productivity, and operational energy efficiency. This study introduces a novel thermal ventilation model (TVM) based on enthalpy balance, which integrates both temperature and humidity control to address the specific thermal regulation requirements of pig housing in regions characterized by high temperatures and humidity, such as Guangdong, China. These challenging environmental conditions can lead to heat stress in pigs, adversely affecting their health and productivity. The TVM provides a precise representation of thermal comfort by accounting for the combined effects of temperature and humidity. Building on the TVM, we formulate an optimization problem using Model Predictive Control (MPC), which dynamically adjusts ventilation rates in real-time by modifying weight factors to minimize energy consumption while keeping the temperature and humidity within the comfort zone of the pigs. The accuracy of the TVM is validated against real-world environmental data from pig housing facilities in Guangdong. The root mean square error of temperature in winter, spring and summer were 1.23, 0.81, and 0.60, demonstrating its reliability and robustness across diverse climatic conditions. Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed MPC strategy significantly improves energy efficiency and environmental comfort, achieving a 100% comfort temperature zone in spring and 83% in summer, compared to 91% and 43% with traditional rule-based control, respectively. However, the model's energy consumption in summer (91.2 kWh) was higher than that of rule-based control (80.8 kWh), reflecting the trade-off between maintaining optimal comfort and energy efficiency under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Tight Convergence Rates in Gradient Mapping for the Difference-of-Convex Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new theoretical convergence guarantees for the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), where the second function is allowed to be weakly-convex, measuring progress via composite gradient mapping. Based on a tight analysis of two iterations of DCA, we identify six parameter regimes leading to sublinear convergence rates toward critical points and establish those rates by proving adapted descent lemmas. We recover existing rates for the standard difference-of-convex decompositions of nonconvex-nonconcave functions, while for all other curvature settings our results are new, complementing recently obtained rates on the gradient residual. Three of our sublinear rates are tight for any number of DCA iterations, while for the other three regimes we conjecture exact rates, using insights from the tight analysis of gradient descent and numerical validation using the performance estimation methodology. Finally, we show how the equivalence between proximal gradient descent (PGD) and DCA allows the derivation of exact PGD rates for any constant stepsize.</description>

      <title>A thorough study of Riemannian Newton's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a thorough numerical study of Riemannian Newton's Method (RNM) for optimization problems, with a focus on the Grassmannian and on the Stiefel manifold. We compare the Riemannian formulation of Newton's Method with its classical Euclidean counterpart based on Lagrange multipliers by applying both approaches to the important and challenging Hartree--Fock energy minimization problem from Quantum Chemistry. Experiments on a dataset of 125 molecules show that the Riemannian approaches achieve higher convergence rates, require fewer iterations, and exhibit greater robustness to the choice of initial guess. In this work we also analyze the numerical issues that arise from using Newton's Method on the total manifold when the cost function is defined on the quotient manifold. We investigate the performance of a modified RNM in which we ignore the small eigenvalues of the Hessian and the results indicate that this modified method is stable and performs on par with the RNM on the quotient manifold.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Curbside Congestion Effects of Ride-hailing Services for Morning Commute using Bi-modal Two-Tandem Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the proliferation of ride-hailing services, curb space in urban areas has become highly congested due to the massive passenger pick-ups and drop-offs. Particularly during peak hours, the massive ride-hailing vehicles waiting to drop off obstruct curb spaces and even disrupt the flow of mainline traffic. However, there is a lack of an analytical model that formulates and mitigates the congestion effects of ride-hailing drop-offs in curb spaces. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel bi-modal two-tandem bottleneck model to depict the commuting behaviors of private vehicles (PVs) and ride-hailing vehicles (RVs) during the morning peak in a linear city. In the model, the upstream bottleneck models the congestion on highways, and the downstream curbside bottlenecks depict the congestion caused by RV drop-offs in curb spaces, PV queue on main roads, and the spillover effects between them in the urban area. The proposed model can be solved in a closed form under eight different scenarios. A time-varying optimal congestion pricing scheme, combined curbside pricing and parking pricing, is proposed to achieve the social optimum. It is found that potential waste of road capacity could occur when there is a mismatch between the highway and curbside bottlenecks, and hence the optimal pricing should be determined in a coordinated manner. A real-world case from Hong Kong shows that the limited curb space and main road in the urban area could be the major congestion bottleneck. Expanding the capacity of the curb space or the main road in the urban area, rather than the highway bottleneck, can effectively reduce social costs. This paper highlights the critical role of curbside management and provides policy implications for the coordinated management of highways and curb spaces.</description>

      <title>Delta-modular ILP Problems of Bounded Codimension, Discrepancy, and Convolution (new version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17001v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For integers $k,n \geq 0$ and a cost vector $c \in Z^n$, we study two fundamental integer linear programming (ILP) problems: \[
  \text{(Standard Form)} \quad \max\bigl\{c^\top x \colon Ax = b,\ x \in Z^n_{\geq 0}\bigr\} \text{ with } A \in Z^{k \times n}, \text{rank}(A) = k, b \in Z^k, \] \[
  \text{(Canonical Form)} \quad \max\bigl\{c^\top x \colon Ax \leq b,\ x \in Z^n\bigr\} \text{ with } A \in Z^{(n+k) \times n}, \text{rank}(A) = n, b \in Z^{n+k}. \] We present improved algorithms for both problems and their feasibility versions, parameterized by $k$ and $\Delta$, where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $\text{rank}(A) \times \text{rank}(A)$ subdeterminants of $A$. Our main complexity results, stated in terms of required arithmetic operations, are: \[ \text{Optimization:}\quad O(\log k)^{2k} \cdot \Delta^2 / 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log \Delta})} + 2^{O(k)} \cdot \text{poly}(\varphi), \] \[ \text{Feasibility:} \quad O(\log k)^k \cdot \Delta \cdot (\log \Delta)^3 + 2^{O(k)} \cdot \text{poly}(\varphi), \] where $\varphi$ represents the input size measured by the bit-encoding length of $(A,b,c)$. We also examine several special cases when $k \in \{0,1\}$, which have important applications in: expected computational complexity of ILP with varying right-hand side $b$, ILP problems with generic constraint matrices, ILP problems on simplices. Our results yield improved complexity bounds for these specific scenarios.
  As independent contributions, we present: An $n^2/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$-time algorithm for the tropical convolution problem on sequences indexed by elements of a finite Abelian group of order $n$; A complete and self-contained error analysis of the generalized DFT over Abelian groups in the Word-RAM model.</description>

      <title>Generalized Inverse Optimal Control and its Application in Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living organisms exhibit remarkable adaptations across all scales, from molecules to ecosystems. We believe that many of these adaptations correspond to optimal solutions driven by evolution, training, and underlying physical and chemical laws and constraints. While some argue against such optimality principles due to their potential ambiguity, we propose generalized inverse optimal control to infer them directly from data. This novel approach incorporates multi-criteria optimality, nestedness of objective functions on different scales, the presence of active constraints, the possibility of switches of optimality principles during the observed time horizon, maximization of robustness, and minimization of time as important special cases, as well as uncertainties involved with the mathematical modeling of biological systems. This data-driven approach ensures that optimality principles are not merely theoretical constructs but are firmly rooted in experimental observations. Furthermore, the inferred principles can be used in forward optimal control to predict and manipulate biological systems, with possible applications in bio-medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. As discussed and illustrated, the well-posed problem formulation and the inference are challenging and require a substantial interdisciplinary effort in the development of theory and robust numerical methods.</description>

Abstract: We propose and study a system of Schr\"odinger's problems and functional equations in probability theory. More precisely, we consider a system of variational problems of relative entropies for probability measures on a Euclidean space with given two endpoint marginals, which can be defined inductively. We also consider an inductively defined system of functional equations, which are Euler's equations for our variational problems. These are generalizations of Schr\"odinger's problem and functional equation. % in probability theory. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to our functional equations, % up to a multiplicative function, from which we show the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer of our variational problem. Our problem gives an approach for a stochastic optimal transport analog of the Knothe--Rosenblatt rearrangement
  via a variational problem point of view.</description>

      <title>Which Optimizer Works Best for Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies approaches. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers -- using both PINNs and PIKANs -- on key challenging linear, stiff, multi-scale and non-linear PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Ginzburg-Landau equations. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs. More broadly, our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of second-order optimization strategies in significantly improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs and PIKANs.</description>

      <title>Learning an Optimal Assortment Policy under Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of offline assortment optimization under the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, where sellers must determine the optimal subset of the products to offer based solely on historical customer choice data. While most existing approaches to learning-based assortment optimization focus on the online learning of the optimal assortment through repeated interactions with customers, such exploration can be costly or even impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we consider the offline learning paradigm and investigate the minimal data requirements for efficient offline assortment optimization. To this end, we introduce Pessimistic Rank-Breaking (PRB), an algorithm that combines rank-breaking with pessimistic estimation. We prove that PRB is nearly minimax optimal by establishing the tight suboptimality upper bound and a nearly matching lower bound. This further shows that "optimal item coverage" - where each item in the optimal assortment appears sufficiently often in the historical data - is both sufficient and necessary for efficient offline learning. This significantly relaxes the previous requirement of observing the complete optimal assortment in the data. Our results provide fundamental insights into the data requirements for offline assortment optimization under the MNL model.</description>

      <title>Design of A* based heuristic algorithm for efficient interdiction in multi-Layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time.</description>
