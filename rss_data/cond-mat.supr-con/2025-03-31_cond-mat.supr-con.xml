      <title>A Topological Superconductor Tuned by Electronic Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological superconductor, characterized by either a chiral order parameter or a chiral topological surface state in proximity to bulk superconductivity, is foundational to topological quantum computing. As in other topological phases of matter, electronic correlations can tune topological superconductivity via modifications of the low-energy Fermiology. Such tuning has not been realized so far. Here we uncover a unique topological superconducting phase in competition with electronic correlations in 10-unit-cell thick FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ films grown on SrTiO$_{3}$ substrates. When the Te content $x$ exceeds $0.7$, we observe a rapid increase of the effective mass for the Fe $d_{xy}$ band, with the emergence of a superconducting topological surface state confirmed by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy; however, near the FeTe limit, the system enters an incoherent regime where the topological surface state becomes unidentifiable and superconductivity is suppressed. Theory suggests that the electron-electron interactions in the odd-parity $xy^-$ band with a strong $d_{xy}$ character lead to an orbital-selective correlated phase. Our work establishes FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ thin films as a unique platform where electronic correlations sensitively modulate topological superconductivity, suggesting opportunities to use tunable electron-electron interactions to engineer new topological phases in a broad class of materials.</description>

      <title>Time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory for design of superconducting wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the superconducting wire. It is known from Maxwell equations that the current creates magnetic field that suppresses superconductivity and wire starts to conduct with resistance. We consider the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory to resolve the problem. The solutions of the system of equations show that applied electric field, perpendicular to the axis of the wire and to the magnetic field restores superconductivity and wire starts to conduct without resistivity. We can increase the current to a new suppression of superconductivity and to restore superconductivity increasing the applied electric field. The aforementioned results permit us to conclude that the superconducting wire can transport a very strong current if the novel design discussed in the paper is applied.</description>

      <title>DC-driven separation of fractional flux quanta in two-band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</description>

      <title>Twisted Nodal Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent proposals for the realization of time-reversal symmetry breaking and topological superconductivity in twisted nodal superconductors have led to a surge of theoretical and experimental studies of these systems, marking one of the newest entries in the rapidly growing field of moir\'e materials. The interplay between order parameters of the separate layers makes twisted superconductors unique, leading to additional emergent phenomena in regimes usually not of importance in moir\'e physics, such as bulk interfaces and large twist angles. We review the physics of twisted nodal superconductors, highlighting both similarities and qualitative differences with other moir\'e platforms. While inspired by the rise of moir\'e materials, the field is anchored in studies of unconventional superconductivity preceding the moir\'e era, which we discuss in detail. In addition to summarizing the developments at the present stage, we present a detailed outlook on the major open questions in the field and some of the most exciting future directions.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in High-Entropy Antimonide M$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$Sb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-entropy concept was applied to the synthesis of transition-metal antimonides, M1-xPtxSb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir). High-entropy antimonide samples crystallized in a pseudo-hexagonal NiAs-type crystal structure with a P63/mmc space group were successfully synthesized through a conventional solid-state reaction and subsequent quenching. A detailed investigation of the composition and equilibration conditions confirmed the reversible phase transition between a multi-phase state at low temperature and an entropy-driven single-phase solid solution at high temperatures. Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements of single-phase M1-xPtxSb (x = 0.2) samples revealed a bulk superconducting transition at 2.15(2) K. This study demonstrates that the high-entropy concept provides numerous opportunities for the discovery of new functional materials such as superconductors.</description>

      <title>Toward the detection of spin-vortex-induced loop currents in a single bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ thin film and their possible use as qubits: Model calculations for three nano-island architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory for cuprate superconductivity predicts the existence of nano-sized loop currents called, ``spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)''. In this wok, we first calculate magnetic fields produced by them in a single bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin film for the purpose of detecting the SVILCs. The estimated magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 10$a$ ($a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) above the surface could be in the order of 100mT; thus, they may be detectable by currently available detection methods. Next, we investigate the use of them as qubits (the ``SVILC qubits'') in an architecture composed of three nano-islands of the thin film; and consider the use of the detection of the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs as the qubit readout. We show there are a number of energy levels suitable for qubit states that can be manipulated by external current feeding, and the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs is large enough to be used for the readout.</description>

      <title>$s_{\pm}$ pairing via interlayer interaction in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films under Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that interlayer \(s_{\pm}\)-wave pairing dominates superconductivity in La\(_{2.85}\)Pr\(_{0.15}\)Ni\(_2\)O\(_7\) thin films through self-consistent mean-field calculations. We further show that applying a perpendicular electric field breaks layer equivalence, generating nodal structures, Fermi arcs, and finite low-energy states in the \(d_{x^2-y^2}\) orbital. Our results quantitatively align with recent experimental observations for the superconducting gaps, and we propose experimental symmetry-breaking perturbations as a direct test for the interlayer pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Density wave order with antiphase feature associated with the pseudogap in cuprate superconductor Bi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong correlation effect in cuprate superconductors have greatly enriched the phase diagram showing the co-existence of superconductivity with many intertwined orders. One of the prominent issues concerning the superconductivity mechanism is about the pseudogap phase which behaves either as cooperator or competitor for superconductivity and its fundamental reason remains still elusive. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) in the model superconducting system Bi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta with a transition temperature Tc~7 K. Although this system is supposed to be slightly overdoped, a pseudogap feature can be easily observed in the energy region of about 20-60 meV. A modulation of local density of states (LDOS) with a periodicity of about 4a0/3 (a0: Cu-O-Cu bond length) can be easily observed, which is also supported by the Fourier transformation pattern with wavevectors at about (0,+-3pi/2a0) and (+-3pi/2a0,0). Surprisingly, we find that the LDOS exhibits a clear antiphase feature in the pseudogap energy region below and above the Fermi energy, indicating that it is an intrinsic feature of the pseudogap phase. We interpret this modulation and antiphase feature as a possible consequence of the pair density wave due to the Amperean pairing with finite momentum. Our results give a deep insight on the understanding of the pseudogap phase in cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Unveiling superconducting properties of an equiatomic hexagonal high entropy alloy via muon spin relaxation and rotation measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting high-entropy alloys (HEAs) present a unique platform for studying the effect of disorder, composition, and crystal structure on superconducting pairing. In this study, we present a comprehensive bulk and microscopic investigation of the rarely observed equiatomic hexagonal HEA Nb-Mo-Ru-Re-Ir using magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our findings confirm bulk type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature of 4.63(2) K and a high upper critical field. Heat capacity and transverse-field $\mu$SR data reveal conventional s-wave superconductivity, while zero-field $\mu$SR results suggest the preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. These findings provide valuable insights into the superconducting pairing mechanism in disordered multicomponent systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport in superconductor heterostructures: some recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews recent advances in low-temperature electronic thermal transport properties of thermally biased superconductor heterostructures focusing on the two-terminal transport. Since the last decade, ferromagnetism has been widely used to enhance the thermoelectricity in heterostructures based on ordinary superconductors. The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric effects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry of the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction. Recently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that emerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced applications. Other forms of magnetism, specifically antiferromagnetism and altermagnetism, have been investigated to unravel the behavior of the thermal and charge current in thermally biased junctions. In parallel to ordinary superconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been explored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers has been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials, including Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally biased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in recent times. Weyl Josephson junctions, multi-terminal Josephson junctions, and various other multilayer junctions have also been studied to engineer large thermoelectric effects and various functionalities with potential applications in superconductor-based thermal device components.</description>

      <title>Intertwining bulk and surface: the case of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies in recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its surface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we propose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface and in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual features detected by surface probes in this material. Through a phenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental signatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of CDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii) the magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the CDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature and its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental checks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.</description>

      <title>Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Spin-Singlet QuBit in a Triangulene Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-$1$ chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a superconducting spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we find a manifold of two lowest-lying, isolated spin-singlet states that undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random-field noise and quasi-particle poisoning. We also introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data post-processing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Domain Walls in Type-II Superconductors and Gradients of Temperature/Spin Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the motion of a domain wall in type-II superconductors driven by inhomogeneities of temperature or spin density. The model consists of the time-dependent GinzburgLandau equation and the thermal/spin diffusion equation whose transport coefficients (the thermal/spin conductivity and the spin relaxation time) depend on the order parameter, interpolating the values for the superconducting and the normal states. Numerical and analytical calculations show that the domain wall moves toward the higher temperature/spin-density region where the order parameter is suppressed. We can understand the motions of the domain walls as dynamical processes reducing the loss of condensation energy. We also analyze the driving force, the viscous force, the thermal force, and the force due to the spin accumulation gradient, on the basis of the momentum balance relations.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of High-Temperature Superconductivity in X2MH6 Compounds under 20 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on high-temperature superconductors has primarily focused on hydrogen-rich compounds, however, the need for extreme pressures limits their practical applications. The X2MH6-type structure Mg2IrH6 stands out because it exhibits superconductivity at 160 K under ambient pressure. This study investigates methods to increase the superconducting transition temperature of this structure via atomic substitution and low-pressure treatment and assess the mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamic stability of structures obtained by substituting Mg and Ir atoms in Mg2IrH6 with elements from the same groups using first-principles calculations. The findings identify 11 stable ternary compounds, 10 of which exhibit superconducting transition temperatures, with three compounds, Mg2CoH6, Mg2RhH6, and Mg2IrH6, exceeding 100 K, classifying them as high-temperature superconductors. Their superconducting figure of merit S values are 2.71, 3.35, and 3.83, respectively, suggesting strong practical application potential. The analysis results indicate that mid-frequency hydrogen phonons significantly enhance superconducting properties via electron-phonon coupling. The band structure study highlights the importance of van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. In addition, electron localization function and Fermi surface topology analyses reveal that the Fermi surface shape and density of states are crucial for increasing superconducting transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</description>
