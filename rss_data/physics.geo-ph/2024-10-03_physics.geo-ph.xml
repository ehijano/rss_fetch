      <title>Generalized Runcorn's theorem and crustal magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the era of NASA's Apollo missions Keith S.~Runcorn proposed an explanation of discrepancy between the Moon's negligible global magnetic field and magnetised samples of lunar regolith, based on identical vanishing of external magnetic field of a spherical shell, magnetized by an internal source which is no longer present. We revisit and generalize the Runcorn's result, showing that it is a consequence of a (weighted) orthogonality of gradients of harmonic functions on a spherical shell in arbitrary number of dimensions. Furthermore, we explore bounds on external magnetic field in the case when the idealized spherical shell is replaced with a more realistic geometric shape and when the thermoremanent magnetization susceptibility deviates from the spherical symmetry. Finally, we analyse a model of thermoremanent magnetization acquired by crustal inward cooling of a spherical astrophysical body and put some general bounds on the associated magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of the Thermal Structure Within Subduction Zones Using Reduced-Order Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Megathrust earthquakes are the largest on Earth, capable of causing strong ground shaking and generating tsunamis. Physical models used to understand megathrust earthquake hazard are limited by existing uncertainties about material properties and governing processes in subduction zones. A key quantity in megathrust hazard assessment is the distance between the updip and downdip rupture limits. The thermal structure of a subduction zone exerts a first-order control on the extent of rupture. We simulate temperature for profiles of the Cascadia, Nankai and Hikurangi subduction zones using a 2D coupled kinematic-dynamic thermal model. We then build reduced-order models (ROMs) for temperature using the interpolated Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (iPOD). The resulting ROMs are data-driven, model agnostic, and computationally cheap to evaluate. Using the ROMs, we can efficiently investigate the sensitivity of temperature to input parameters, physical processes, and modeling choices. We find that temperature, and by extension the potential rupture extent, is most sensitive to variability in parameters that describe shear heating on the slab interface, followed by parameters controlling the thermal structure of the incoming lithosphere and coupling between the slab and the mantle. We quantify the effect of using steady-state vs. time-dependent models, and of uncertainty in the choice of isotherm representing the downdip rupture limit. We show that variability in input parameters translates to significant differences in estimated moment magnitude. Our analysis highlights the strong effect of variability in the apparent coefficient of friction, with previously published ranges resulting in pronounced variability in estimated rupture limit depths.</description>

      <title>A novel neural network-based approach to derive a geomagnetic baseline for robust characterization of geomagnetic indices at mid-latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic indices derived from ground magnetic measurements characterize the intensity of solar-terrestrial interaction. The \textit{Kp} index derived from multiple magnetic observatories at mid-latitude has commonly been used for space weather operations. Yet, its temporal cadence is low and its intensity scale is crude. To derive a new generation of geomagnetic indices, it is desirable to establish a geomagnetic `baseline' that defines the quiet-level of activity without solar-driven perturbations. We present a new approach for deriving a baseline that represents the time-dependent quiet variations focusing on data from Chambon-la-For\^et, France. Using a filtering technique, the measurements are first decomposed into the above-diurnal variation and the sum of 24h, 12h, 8h, and 6h filters, called the daily variation. Using correlation tools and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify parameters that dominantly correlate with the daily variation. Here, we predict the daily `quiet' variation using a long short-term memory neural network trained using at least 11 years of data at 1h cadence. This predicted daily quiet variation is combined with linear extrapolation of the secular trend associated with the intrinsic geomagnetic variability, which dominates the above-diurnal variation, to yield a new geomagnetic baseline. Unlike the existing baselines, our baseline is insensitive to geomagnetic storms. It is thus suitable for defining geomagnetic indices that accurately reflect the intensity of solar-driven perturbations. Our methodology is quick to implement and scalable, making it suitable for real-time operation. Strategies for operational forecasting of our geomagnetic baseline 1 day and 27 days in advance are presented.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Equations of Fluid Motion for Well-Conditioned Direct Numerical Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection is a ubiquitous process driving geophysical/astrophysical fluid flows, which are typically strongly constrained by planetary rotation on large scales. A celebrated model of such flows, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, has been extensively studied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments, but the parameter values attainable by state-of-the-art methods are limited to moderately rapid rotation (Ekman numbers $Ek\gtrsim10^{-8}$), while realistic geophysical/astrophysical $Ek$ are significantly smaller. Asymptotically reduced equations of motion, the nonhydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations (NHQGE), describing the flow evolution in the limit $Ek\to 0$, do not apply at finite rotation rates. The geophysical/astrophysical regime of small but finite $Ek$ therefore remains currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce a new, numerically advantageous formulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to0$, the \textit{rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations} (RiNSE). We solve the RiNSE using a spectral quasi-inverse method resulting in a sparse, fast algorithm to perform efficient DNS in this previously unattainable parameter regime. We validate our results against the literature across a range of $Ek$, and demonstrate that the algorithmic approaches taken remain accurate and numerically stable at $Ek$ as low as $10^{-15}$. Like the NHQGE, the RiNSE derive their efficiency from adequate conditioning, eliminating spurious growing modes that otherwise induce numerical instabilities at small $Ek$. We show that the time derivative of the mean temperature is inconsequential for accurately determining the Nusselt number in the stationary state, significantly reducing the required simulation time, and demonstrate that full DNS using RiNSE agree with the NHQGE at very small $Ek$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span a large fraction of the planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. If these timescales are confirmed with a larger suite of numerical simulations, the existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>
