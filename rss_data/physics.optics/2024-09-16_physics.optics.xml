      <title>Widely tunable dual acousto-optic interferometric device based on a hollow core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An all-fiber dual Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based on an acoustically modulated hollow-core fiber (HCF) is experimentally demonstrated for the first time. By attaching an acoustic driver in between the fixed ends of an HCF, we fabricated two acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) with distinct driver positions, allowing for synchronizing two in-line MZIs inside the HCF. The first MZI is set by two acoustic long-period gratings separated by a second MZI formed at the fiber and driver attaching region. We show that this setup enables frequency-tuning of the coupling between the fundamental and higher-order modes in the HCF. Additionally, we simulate and analyze the HCF modal couplings and MZIs' modulated spectra under distinct device parameters using the transfer matrix method. The new AOM-MZI enables tuning of the MZIs free spectral range by adjusting 1 Hz of the electrical frequency, which is promising to modulate multiwavelength filters, sensors and fiber lasers.</description>

      <title>Plenoptic microscopy and photography from intensity correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel methods to perform plenoptic imaging at the diffraction limit by measuring intensity correlations of light. The first method is oriented towards plenoptic microscopy, a promising technique which allows refocusing and depth-of-field enhancement, in post-processing, as well as scanning free 3D imaging. To overcome the limitations of standard plenoptic microscopes, we propose an adaptation of Correlation Plenoptic Imaging (CPI) to the working conditions of microscopy. We consider and compare different architectures of CPI microscopes, and discuss the improved robustness with respect to previous protocols against turbulence around the sample. The second method is based on measuring correlations between the images of two reference planes, arbitrarily chosen within the tridimensional scene of interest, providing an unprecedented combination of image resolution and depth of field. The results lead the way towards the realization of compact designs for CPI devices.</description>

      <title>Innovative schemes for Correlation Plenoptic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CPI is a novel imaging modality capable of addressing the intrinsic limitations of conventional plenoptic imaging - namely, the resolution loss and the sacrificed change of perspective, - while guaranteeing the typical advantages of plenotpic imaging: 3D imaging, refocusing of acquired pictures, in post-processing, and depth of field extension. In this work, we review a recently developed CPI scheme, named correlation plenoptic imaging between arbitrary planes, and derive the algorithm for image refocusing.</description>

      <title>Direct frequency comb cavity ring-down spectroscopy: Enhancing Sensitivity and Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to cavity ring-down spectroscopy utilizing an optical frequency comb as the direct probe of the Fabry-Perot cavity, coupled with a time-resolved Fourier transform spectrometer for parallel retrieval of ring-down events. Our method achieves high spectral resolution over a broad range, enabling precision measurements of cavity losses and absorption lineshapes with enhanced sensitivity. A critical advancement involves a stabilization technique ensuring complete extinction of comb light without compromising cavity stabilization. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system through precision spectroscopy of carbon monoxide rovibrational transitions perturbed by argon.</description>

      <title>Grafted AlGaAs/GeSn Optical Pumping Laser Operating up to 130 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group IV GeSn double-heterostructure (DHS) lasers offer unique advantages of a direct bandgap and CMOS compatibility. However, further improvements in laser performance have been bottlenecked by limited junction properties of GeSn through conventional epitaxy and wafer bonding. This work leverages semiconductor grafting to synthesize and characterize optically pumped ridge edge-emitting lasers (EELs) with an AlGaAs nanomembrane (NM) transfer-printed onto an epitaxially grown GeSn substrate, interfaced by an ultrathin Al2O3 layer. The grafted AlGaAs/GeSn DHS lasers show a lasing threshold of 11.06 mW at 77 K and a maximum lasing temperature of 130 K. These results highlight the potential of the grafting technique for enhancing charge carrier and optical field confinements, paving the way for room-temperature electrically injected GeSn lasers.</description>

      <title>Selective Excitation of Bloch Modes in Canalized Polaritonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritonic crystals (PoCs) have experienced significant advancements through involving hyperbolic polaritons in anisotropic materials such as $\alpha$-MoO$_{\rm 3}$, offering a promising approach for nanoscale light control and improved light-matter interactions. Notably, twisted bilayer $\alpha$-MoO$_{\rm 3}$ enables tunable iso-frequency contours (IFCs), especially generating flat IFCs at certain twist angles, which could enhance mode selectivity in their PoCs through the highly collimated and canalized polaritons. This study unveils the selective excitation of Bloch modes in PoCs with square-lattice structures on twisted bilayer $\alpha$-MoO$_{\rm 3}$ with canalized phonon polaritons. Through the optimization of the square lattice design, there is an effective redistribution of canalized polaritons into the reciprocal lattices of PoCs. Fine-tuning the periodicity and orientation of the hole lattice enables momentum matching between flat IFCs and co-linear reciprocal points, allowing precise and directional control over desired Bragg resonances and Bloch modes. This research establishes a versatile platform for tunable polaritonic devices and paves the way for advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature valley-selective emission enabled by planar chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable spin-photon interfaces in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are pivotal to realizing classical and quantum operations using photons. Valley pseudospin in TMDCs allows circularly polarized light to be coupled with electron (hole) spin, thus enabling initialization and readout of both classical and quantum information. Rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission. This platform, driven by chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum, provides circular eigen-polarization states featuring a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement, and results in unitary emission circular dichroism (i.e. single-handed circularly polarized emission). Our fabricated high-Q-factor (&gt; 200) Si chiral metasurfaces at visible wavelengths strongly enhance valley-selective optical transitions in devices incorporating MoSe2 monolayers under linearly polarized light excitation, achieving a high degree of optical circular polarization (DOP) from 100 K to 294 K and reaching nearly 0.5 at 294 K. The high DOP is attributed to enhanced exciton/trion radiative recombination rates for a specific valley. Our work could facilitate the development of compact chiral classical and quantum light sources and the creation of molecular chiral polaritons for quantum enantioselective synthesis.</description>

      <title>Cladding effect on the mode index engineered tuned cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits require a cladding material on top to prevent any outside interaction with the photonic circuit elements and electromagnetic modes that could cause damage. Mohit et al. proposed selective tuning of the resonance of a cavity by using the mode-index engineering method. However, their work did not consider adding a cladding (upper cladding) material on top of the tuned cavity. In this study, I aim to build upon their work by investigating the impact of depositing cladding material on the frequency distribution of tuned cavities through analytical studies and numerical experiments. I identify crucial calculation parameters and discuss the optimum conditions for high-resolution tuning and large tuning range.</description>

      <title>Optical resonators constitute a universal spin simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry recently introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024)]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size.</description>

      <title>Programmable multifunctional integrated microwave photonic circuit on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave photonics, with its advanced high-frequency signal processing capabilities, is expected to play a crucial role in next-generation wireless communications and radar systems. The realization of highly integrated, high-performance, and multifunctional microwave photonic links will pave the way for its widespread deployment in practical applications, which is a significant challenge. Here, leveraging thin-film lithium niobate intensity modulator and programmable cascaded microring resonators, we demonstrate for the first time a tunable microwave photonic notch filter that simultaneously achieves high level of integration along with high dynamic range, high link gain, low noise figure, and ultra-high rejection ratio. Additionally, this programmable on-chip system is multifunctional, allowing for the dual-band notch filter and the suppression of the high-power interference signal. This work demonstrates the potential applications of the thin-film lithium niobate platform in the field of high-performance integrated microwave photonic filtering and signal processing, facilitating the advancement of microwave photonic system towards practical applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Moderate Refractive Index Nanoantennas for Enhancing the Photoluminescence Signal of Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of nanostructures to enhance the emission of single-photon sources has withdrawn some attention in last decade due to the development of quantum technologies. In particular, the use of metallic and high refractive index dielectric materials has been proposed. However, the utility of moderate refractive index dielectric nanostructures to achieve more efficient single-photon sources remains unexplored. Here, a systematic comparison of various metallic, high refractive index and moderate refractive index dielectric nanostructures has been performed to optimize the excitation and emission of a CdSe/ZnS single quantum dot at visible spectral region. Several geometries have been evaluated in terms of electric field enhancement and Purcell factor, considering the combination of metallic, high refractive index and moderate refractive index dielectric materials conforming homogeneous and hybrid nanocylinder dimers. Our results demonstrate that moderate refractive index dielectric nanoparticles can enhance the photoluminescence signal of quantum emitters due to their broader electric and magnetic dipolar resonances compared to high refractive index dielectric nanoparticles. However, hybrid combinations of metallic and high refractive index dielectric nanostructures offer the largest intensity enhancement and Purcell factors at the excitation and emission wavelengths of the quantum emitter, respectively. The results of this work may find applications in the development of single-photon sources</description>

      <title>Shaping space-time wavepackets beyond the paraxial limit using a dispersion magnifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time wavepackets (STWPs) have received significant attention since they can propagate in free space at arbitrary group velocity without dispersion and diffraction. However, at present, the generation of STWPs has been limited to the paraxial regime. Here we show that conventional optical elements can be used to extend STWPs beyond the paraxial regime. A dispersion magnifier, consisting of two lenses and a beam expander, applies spatiotemporal shaping to paraxial STWPs to create nonparaxial STWPs. The control of the magnification ratio results in versatile engineering capabilities on group velocity, beam diameter, and propagation distance. As an example, we numerically demonstrated long-distance propagation or slow group velocity of the output wavepacket with subwavelength cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Production and magnetic self-confinement of $e^-e^+$ plasma by an extremely intense laser pulse incident on a structured solid target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an all-optical, single-laser-pulse scheme for generating dense, relativistic, strongly-magnetized electron-positron pair plasma. The scheme involves the interaction of an extremely intense ($I \gtrsim \SI{e24}{\watt/\cm^2}$) circularly polarized laser pulse with a solid-density target containing a conical cavity. Through full-scale three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that account for quantum electrodynamical effects, it is shown that this interaction results in two significant outcomes: first, the generation of quasi-static axial magnetic fields reaching tens of gigagauss due to the inverse Faraday effect; and second, the production of large quantities of electron-positron pairs (up to $\num{e13}$) via the Breit-Wheeler process. The $e^-e^+$ plasma becomes trapped in the magnetic field and remains confined for hundreds of femtoseconds, far exceeding the laser timescale. The dependency of pair plasma parameters, as well as the efficiency of plasma production and confinement, is discussed in relation to the properties of the laser pulse and the target. Realizing this scheme experimentally would enable the investigation of physical processes relevant to extreme astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Endoscopic Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy through a fiber microprobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a powerful analytical method for not only the chemical identification of solid, liquid, and gas species, but also the quantification of their concentration. However, the chemical quantification capability of FTIR is significantly hindered when the analyte is surrounded by a strong IR absorbing medium, such as liquid solutions. To overcome this limit, here we develop an IR fiber microprobe that can be inserted into liquid medium, and obtain full FTIR spectra at points of interest. To benchmark this endoscopic FTIR method, we insert the microprobe into bulk water covering a ZnSe substrate and measure the IR transmittance of water as a function of the probe-substrate distance. The obtained vibrational modes, overall transmittance vs z profiles, quantitative absorption coefficients, and micro z-section IR transmittance spectra are all consistent with the standard IR absorption properties of water. The results pave the way for endoscopic chemical profiling inside bulk liquid solutions, promising for applications in many biological, chemical, and electrochemical systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the propagation of high frequency wave-beams in highly turbulent atmospheres. Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [Bal, G. and Nair, A., arXiv:2402.17107.]</description>

      <title>Towards Single-Lens Controllable Depth-of-Field Imaging via All-in-Focus Aberration Correction and Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controllable Depth-of-Field (DoF) imaging commonly produces amazing visual effects based on heavy and expensive high-end lenses. However, confronted with the increasing demand for mobile scenarios, it is desirable to achieve a lightweight solution with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS). This work centers around two major limitations of MOS, i.e., the severe optical aberrations and uncontrollable DoF, for achieving single-lens controllable DoF imaging via computational methods. A Depth-aware Controllable DoF Imaging (DCDI) framework is proposed equipped with All-in-Focus (AiF) aberration correction and monocular depth estimation, where the recovered image and corresponding depth map are utilized to produce imaging results under diverse DoFs of any high-end lens via patch-wise convolution. To address the depth-varying optical degradation, we introduce a Depth-aware Degradation-adaptive Training (DA2T) scheme. At the dataset level, a Depth-aware Aberration MOS (DAMOS) dataset is established based on the simulation of Point Spread Functions (PSFs) under different object distances. Additionally, we design two plug-and-play depth-aware mechanisms to embed depth information into the aberration image recovery for better tackling depth-aware degradation. Furthermore, we propose a storage-efficient Omni-Lens-Field model to represent the 4D PSF library of various lenses. With the predicted depth map, recovered image, and depth-aware PSF map inferred by Omni-Lens-Field, single-lens controllable DoF imaging is achieved. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the recovery performance, and attains impressive single-lens controllable DoF imaging results, providing a seminal baseline for this field. The source code and the established dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DCDI.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Wave Localisation in Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of metamaterials composed of high-contrast subwavelength resonators and show the existence of localised modes in such a setting. A crucial assumption in this paper is time-modulated material parameters. We prove a so-called capacitance matrix approximation of the wave equation in the form of an ordinary differential equation. These formulas set the ground for the derivation of a first-principles characterisation of localised modes in terms of the generalised capacitance matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical results supporting our analytical results showing for the first time the phenomenon of space-time localised waves in a perturbed time-modulated metamaterial. Such spatio-temporal localisation is only possible in the presence of subwavelength resonances in the unperturbed structure. We introduce the time-dependent degree of localisation to quantitatively determine the localised modes and provide a variety of numerical experiments to illustrate our formulations and results.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement entropy characterizes the correlation of multi-particles and unveils the crucial features of open quantum systems. However, the experimental realization of exploring entanglement in non-Hermitian systems remains a challenge. In parallel, quantum walks have offered the possibility of studying the underlying mechanisms of non-Hermitian physics, which includes exceptional points, the non-Hermitian skin effect, and non-Bloch phase transitions. Unfortunately, these studies have only involved and prevailingly focused on the behavior of a single particle. Here, we propose and experimentally realize quantum walks of two indistinguishable photons in engineered non-Hermitian photonic lattices. We have successfully observed the unidirectional behavior of quantum walks in the bulk far from the edges induced by the skin effect. Moreover, we experimentally reveal the suppression of entanglement that is caused by the skin effect in non-Hermitian systems. Our study may facilitate a deep understanding of entanglement in open quantum many-body systems that are far from thermal equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: The current state of research on vortices carried by quantum droplets (QDs) has predicted their existence, in the stable form, in two- and three-dimensional free-space binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and dipolar BECs. These theoretical results suggest that QDs may be excellent carriers of self-trapped vortex states. Given that the experimental creation of QDs has already been firmly established, the observation of embedded vortices in them becomes a key question for the next phase of the development in the field.</description>

Abstract: Recently, several single-pixel imaging (SPI) schemes have emerged for imaging fast-moving objects and have shown dramatic results. However, fast image reconstruction of a moving object with high quality is still challenging for SPI, thereby limiting its practical application. In this paper, we present a simultaneous tracking and imaging method that incorporates position encoding and spatial information encoding through Fourier patterns. The utilization of Fourier patterns with specific spatial frequencies ensures robust and accurate object localization. By exploiting the properties of the Fourier transforms, our method achieves a remarkable reduction in time complexity while significantly enhancing image quality. Furthermore, we introduce an optimized sampling strategy specifically designed for small moving objects, significantly reducing the required dwell time for imaging. The proposed method provides a practical solution for real-time tracking, imaging, and edge detection of moving objects, underscoring its considerable potential for diverse applications.</description>

Abstract: Quaternions have been used to represent polarization states and polarization operators. But so far, only polarizers, dichroic or non-depolarizing devices have been represented in that way. We propose a quaternionic representation of perfect as well as partial depolarizers. It leads us to design actual setups for producing natural (unpolarized) light from an arbitrary partially or completely polarized wave or for reducing the degree of polarization of a wave. We conclude by making the link with Azzam's polarization orthogonalization problem.</description>

Abstract: Miniaturized spectrometers hold great promise for in situ, in vitro, and even in vivo sensing applications. However, their size reduction imposes vital performance constraints in meeting the rigorous demands of spectroscopy, including fine resolution, high accuracy, and ultra-wide observation window. The prevailing view in the community holds that miniaturized spectrometers are most suitable for the coarse identification of signature peaks. In this paper, we present an integrated reconstructive spectrometer that enables near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic metrology, and demonstrate a fully packaged sensor with auxiliary electronics. Such a sensor operates over a 520 nm bandwidth together with a resolution of less than 8 pm, which translates into a record-breaking bandwidth-to-resolution ratio of over 65,000. The classification of different types of solid substances and the concentration measurement of aqueous and organic solutions are performed, all achieving approximately 100% accuracy. Notably, the detection limit of our sensor matches that of the commercial benchtop counterparts, which is as low as 0.1% (i.e. 100 mg/dL) for identifying the concentration of glucose solution.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <title>Origin of nonlinear photocurrents in chiral multifold semimetal CoSi unveiled by terahertz emission spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic identification of distinct nonlinear photocurrents unveils quantum geometric properties of electron wavefunctions and the momentum-space topological structures. This is especially interesting, but still puzzling, for chiral topological semimetals with possibilities of hosting giant quantized circular photogalvanic effect. Here we report a comprehensive terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopic analysis of nonlinear photoconductivity of chiral multifold CoSi at 0.26 ~ 1 eV. We find a large linear shift conductivity (17 {\mu}A/V2), and confirm a giant injection conductivity (167 {\mu}A/V2) as a consequence of strongly interfered non-quantized contributions from the vicinity of multifold nodes with opposite chiralities. The bulk injection current excited by the pump field with a complex wavevector is shown to carry both longitudinal and transverse components. Symmetry analyses further unveil weak nonlocal photon drag effect in addition to the photogalvanic effect. This work not only highlights chiral transition metal monosilicides for mid-infrared photovoltaic applications via various nonlinear optical channels, but also consolidates the THz spectroscopy for quantitative photovoltaic research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17475v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetry in a non-Hermitian framework can be harnessed for numerous applications in optics such as laser mode selection, non-reciprocal light propagation, polaritonic optical switches, and enhanced sensing. Here we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity in the PT-symmetry broken phase via polarization selective optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A microscopic theory of stimulated Raman process in anisotropic microcavity successfully explains our results at various temperatures and enabled us to predict the parameters of a proposed quantum PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser and the proposed theory of stimulated Raman scattering in anisotropic microcavity can lead to future development of novel technologies such as efficient quantum frequency converters for applications in quantum photonics and information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers can revolutionize science and technology, but their realization remains challenging across all platforms. A promising route to scalability is photonic measurement-based quantum computation, where single-qubit measurements on large cluster states, together with feedforward, enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, generating large cluster states at high rates is notoriously difficult, as detection probabilities drop exponentially with the number of photons comprising the state. We tackle this challenge by encoding multiple qubits on each photon through high-dimensional spatial encoding, generating cluster states with over nine qubits at a rate of 100Hz. Additionally, we demonstrate that high-dimensional encoding substantially reduces the computation duration by enabling instantaneous feedforward between qubits encoded in the same photon. Our findings pave the way for resource-efficient measurement-based quantum computation using high-dimensional entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Broadband correlated photon pairs (biphotons) are valuable in quantum metrology, but current generation methods either involve complex nonlinear structures or lack sufficient bandwidth and brightness. In this work, we theoretically describe and experimentally demonstrate a novel technique for generation of a bright collinear biphoton field with a broad spectrum, achieved by using a tightly focused pump in a bulk nonlinear crystal. As the most straightforward application of the source, we employ Michelson interferometer-based quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT). Utilizing the source enables the demonstration of record resolution and dispersion cancellation for this QOCT scheme.</description>

      <title>A General Bayesian Algorithm for the Autonomous Alignment of Beamlines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous methods to align beamlines can decrease the amount of time spent on diagnostics, and also uncover better global optima leading to better beam quality. The alignment of these beamlines is a high-dimensional, expensive-to-sample optimization problem involving the simultaneous treatment of many optical elements with correlated and nonlinear dynamics. Bayesian optimization is a strategy of efficient global optimization that has proved successful in similar regimes in a wide variety of beamline alignment applications, though it has typically been implemented for particular beamlines and optimization tasks. In this paper, we present a basic formulation of Bayesian inference and Gaussian process models as they relate to multiobjective Bayesian optimization, as well as the practical challenges presented by beamline alignment. We show that the same general implementation of Bayesian optimization with special consideration for beamline alignment can quickly learn the dynamics of particular beamlines in an online fashion through hyperparameter fitting with no prior information. We present the implementation of a concise software framework for beamline alignment and test it on four different optimization problems for experiments at x-ray beamlines of the National Synchrotron Light Source II and the Advanced Light Source and an electron beam at the Accelerator Test Facility, along with benchmarking on a simulated digital twin. We discuss new applications of the framework, and the potential for a unified approach to beamline alignment at synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for coherently shaping attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walk of a genuine single-photon entangled state</title>

Abstract: A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Construction of Molecular Potential and Its Application in Exploring the Deep-Lying-Orbital Effect in High-Order Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during the H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtue surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>

      <title>Super-bunching light with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-classical light sources emitting bundles of N-photons with strong correlation represent versatile resources of interdisciplinary importance with applications ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing. Yet, high-order correlations, gN(0),quantifying photon correlation, are still limited to hundreds. Here, we report the generation of a super-bunching light source in photonic crystal fiber with g2(0) reaching 5.86*104 and g5(0) up to 2.72*108, through measuring its photon number probability distributions. under giant g2(0) values, the super-bunching light source presents upturned-tail photon distributions and ubiquitous extreme multi-photon events, where 31 photons from a single light pulse at a mean of 1.99*10-4 photons per pulse have been determined. The probability of this extreme event has been enhanced by 10139 folds compared to a coherent laser with Poissonian distribution. By varying the power of the pumping laser, both photon number distributions and corresponding high-order correlations of this light source can be substantially tailored from Poissonian to super-bunching distributions. These phenomena are attributed to the synchronized nonlinear interactions in photonic crystal fibers pumping by bright squeezed light, and the theoretical simulations agree well with the experimental results. Our research showcases the ability to achieve non-classical light sources with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events, paving the way for high-order correlation imaging, extreme nonlinear optical effects, quantum information processing, and exploring light-matter interactions with multi-photon physics.</description>
