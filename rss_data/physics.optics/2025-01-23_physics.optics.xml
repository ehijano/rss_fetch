      <title>Tunable extraordinary optical transmission for integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of light through opaque materials, served by periodic arrays of subwavelength holes, has revolutionized imaging and sensor technology with a breakthrough of extraordinary optical transmission (EOT). The enhanced optical transmission assisted by surface plasmon resonances (SPR) has become the most ingenious phenomenon in the field of light-matter interaction. Active tuning of SPR presents a new and simple way to control spectral features of the EOT signal (without the need to change the geometrical structure of the device). This provides a new possibility to integrate an active EOT device with tunable operational frequencies on a single chip of photonic integrated circuits (PIC)- a new scalable instrument in the optoelectronic industry, and quantum technology for improving subwavelength optical imaging and biomedical sensing. In this review, we discuss the fundamentals of EOT, the role of SPR, and how the active quantum plasmonic control of the EOT device makes it a feasible on-chip electro-optic programmable element for integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth, measurement and modeling of the optical activity of $\alpha$-GeO$_2$. Comparison with $\alpha$-SiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aimed first at growing high quality bulk $\alpha$-GeO$_2$ crystals in their Quartz iso-structural form ($\alpha$-SiO$_2$), using a high temperature flux method. By optimizing the flux composition and the geometry and orientation of the seeds, it has been possible to achieve growth yields up to 90 % leading for the first time to bulk single crystals up to 3.5 cm$^3$. Thanks to the optical quality and size of the obtained crystals, the second step of this study was the measurement of the optical activity of $\alpha$-GeO$_2$ between 0.3 and 2 $\mu$m. This gave access to the value of one of the independent components of the gyration tensor (g33) as a function of the wavelength. An $\alpha$-SiO$_2$ slab have been used to validate our methodology. Both crystals show a magnitude of optical activity of 3.4x10$^{-5}$ rad/$\mu$m in the near IR range and great variations where the higher values are 3.4x10$^{-3}$ rad/$\mu$m and 1.7x10$^{-3}$ rad/$\mu$m at 0.3 $\mu$m for $\alpha$-GeO$_2$ and $\alpha$-SiO$_2$, respectively. The measurements are perfectly described by an empirical model that we propose and which relies on the macroscopic first-order electrical susceptibility and on the pitch of the structural helix compared to the wavelength of light.</description>

      <title>Optimal Targeted Mode Transport in Complex Wave Environments: A Universal Statistical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of structured waves have resulted in sophisticated coherent wavefront shaping schemes that provide unprecedented control of waves in various complex settings. These techniques exploit multiple scattering events and the resulting interference of wave paths within these complex environments. Here, we introduce the concept of targeted mode transport (TMT), which enables energy transfer from specific input channels to designated output channels in multimode wave-chaotic cavities by effectively engaging numerous cavity modes. We develop a statistical theory that provides upper bounds on optimal TMT, incorporating operational realities such as losses, coupling strengths and the accessibility of specific interrogating channels. The theoretical predictions for the probability distribution of TMT eigenvalues are validated through experiments with microwave chaotic networks of coaxial cables as well as two-dimensional and three-dimensional complex cavities. These findings have broad implications for applications ranging from indoor wireless communications to imaging and beyond.</description>

      <title>Analyzer-less X-ray Interferometry with Super-Resolution Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of super-resolution methods for X-ray grating interferometry without an analyzer with detectors that fail to meet the Nyquist sampling rate needed for traditional image recovery algorithms. This method enables Talbot-Lau interferometry without the X-ray absorbing analyzer and allows for higher autocorrelation lengths for the analyzer-less Modulated Phase Grating Interferometer. This will allow for reduced X-ray dose and higher autocorrelation lengths than previously accessible. We demonstrate the use of super-resolution methods to iteratively reconstruct attenuation, differential-phase, and dark-field images using simulations of a one-dimensional lung phantom with tumors. For a fringe period of pD = 22 {\mu}m, we compare the simulated imaging performance of interferometers with a 30 {\mu}m and 50 {\mu}m detector for various signal-to-noise ratios. We show that our super-resolution iterative reconstruction methods are highly robust and can be used to improve grating interferometry for cases where traditional algorithms cannot be used.</description>

      <title>Manipulating nonadiabatic dynamics by plasmonic nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, plasmonic nanocavities have emerged as powerful tools for controlling and enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. This study explores the role of plasmonic nanocavities in manipulating nonadiabatic dynamics, particularly in systems where fast electronic transitions are crucial. By coupling molecular states to the plasmonic resonances of metallic nanocavities, we demonstrate that the local electromagnetic fields generated by plasmons can significantly influence the rates and pathways of nonadiabatic transitions, including electron transfer and excitation relaxation processes. Using the Floquet quantum master equation (FQME) and Floquet surface hopping (FSH) methods that we previously developed, we find that plasmonic nanocavities can enhance nonadiabatic effects by tuning the plasmonic coupling strength, the molecule-metal interaction strength, and the material properties. These approaches offer a new perspective for predicting molecular dynamics in ultrafast processes. Our findings pave the way for designing novel plasmonic devices capable of controlling electron and energy transfer in chemical reactions, optoelectronic applications, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Three-stage dynamics of nonlinear pulse amplification in ultrafast mid-infrared fiber amplifier with anomalous dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear pulse amplification in optical fiber, with capability of breaking the gain-bandwidth limitation, is a key technique for high-energy, ultrafast pulse generation. In the longer wavelength region (including 1.55 {\mu}m, 2 {\mu}m and 2.8 {\mu}m) where the gain fiber has normally strong anomalous dispersion, the nonlinear amplification process over fiber exhibits more complicated dynamics than that of its 1-{\mu}m counterpart, and the underlying mechanism of the nonlinear pulse propagation process in high-gain anomalous fiber is still elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate an in-depth study on the nonlinear amplification process in high-gain ultrafast mid-infrared fiber, providing clear physical understanding on the debate of adiabatic soliton compression. We unveil that under the high-gain condition, the ultrafast pulse launched into the anomalous gain fiber experiences successively three distinct stages, named as the balance between linear and nonlinear chirp, high-order-soliton-like pulse compression and pulse splitting due to high-order effects. While a relatively-clean ultrafast pulse can be obtained immediately after the high-order-soliton-like compression stage, excessive gain fiber length could hardly enhance further the pulse peak power due to soliton splitting. Our findings can provide several critical guidelines for designing high-power ultrafast fiber amplifiers at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Bright single-photon source in a silicon chip by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. Under above-gap continuous-wave excitation, a very clean photon antibunching behavior ($g{^2} \leq 0.06$) is observed over the entire power range, which highlights the absence of parasitic emitters. Purcell-enhancement of W's zero-phonon emission provides both a record-high photoluminescence count rate among Si color centers (ca $1.2 \times 10^{6}$ counts/s) and apparent Debye-Waller factor around 99%. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with 93% purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.</description>

      <title>Polarization Inversion with $\mathcal{P}\cdot\mathcal{T}\cdot\mathcal{D}$ Symmetric Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that arbitrary scatterers preserving parity-time-duality ($\mathcal{P}\cdot\mathcal{T}\cdot\mathcal{D}$) symmetry inherently produce a backscattered wave whose electric field is the mirror-symmetric counterpart of the incident electric field, up to an amplitude factor, with respect to the system's characteristic mirror plane. Specifically, we establish that a general elliptically polarized wave, when reflected from such structures, exhibits a polarization state related to the polarization ellipse of the incident wave by a parity transformation. Notably, a circularly polarized wave reflects with spin angular momentum opposite to that of the incident field, in stark contrast to reflection from conventional conducting screens. These findings enable several applications such as reflective polarizers.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Chiral Structures for Giant Helical Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating chiral light-matter interactions is essential for advancing applications in sensing, imaging, and pharmaceutical development. However, the chiroptical response in natural chiral molecules and subwavelength chiral structures is inherently weak, with the characterization tool limited to optical methods that utilize the light with spin angular momentum (SAM). To overcome this, orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams, characterized by helical wavefronts, have emerged as a compelling research focus. Helical dichroism (HD) describes the differential absorbance of OAM beams with opposite signs of topological charges. By using inverse design with adjoint methods for topology optimization, we design the chiral structure optimized to increase HD response under OAM beam incidence, demonstrating a giant HD response of ~107% with topological charges $|\pm\ell|$ = 3 at the wavelength of 800 nm. This study reveals distinct helicity-dependent interactions between the structure and OAM beams, highlighting the potential for custom-tuned chiroptical responses.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Pulse Compression Using a Hybrid All-Bulk Multipass Cell Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical study of ultrashort pulse compression using a three-stage hybrid all-bulk multipass cell scheme. By operating in the enhanced frequency chirp regime, we achieve the compression of pulses from around 180 fs to 4 fs pulse duration (a total compression factor above 45), with side lobes contributing with intensity values lower than 0.2 % of the peak intensity. Optimal conditions for the enhanced frequency chirp regime propagation have been identified, enabling smooth spectral broadening and high-quality temporal profiles. The first two stages are based on bulk multipass cells to achieve a controlled spectral broadening, while the third stage consists of a thin plate to reach the spectral broadening needed for few cycle pulses without leaving the enhanced frequency chirp regime.</description>

      <title>Temporally symmetry-broken metasurfaces for ultrafast resonance creation and annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces, compact platforms for nanoscale light manipulation, are transforming technologies like holography, quantum cryptography, and optical computing. Despite their versatility, tunability in metasurfaces has mainly relied on shifting the resonance wavelength or increasing material losses to spectrally detune or quench resonant modes, respectively. However, both methods face fundamental limitations, such as limited Q-factor and near-field enhancement control and the inability to achieve resonance on/off switching by completely coupling and decoupling the mode from the far-field. Here, we demonstrate temporal symmetry-breaking in metasurfaces via ultrafast optical pumping, marking the first experimental realization of radiative loss-driven resonance creation, annihilation, broadening, and sharpening. We introduce restored symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum as a new concept which are central to the realization of temporal symmetry-breaking. These states arise in metasurfaces with geometrically asymmetric unit cells, where the total dipole moment, composed of two antisymmetric dipoles, cancels out. Mie-resonant optical absorption within specific regions of the unit cell locally modifies the refractive index, disrupting the balance between the two dipole moments. A total dipole moment is thereby created or annihilated, and consequently, the radiative loss is tuned. This enables full control over coupling to incoming light, allowing precise adjustment of the resonance linewidth, near-field enhancement, and resonance amplitude. Our work establishes radiative loss-based active metasurfaces with potential applications ranging from high-speed optical and quantum communications to time-crystals and photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamics of time-varying media: Beyond abrupt temporal interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the effects of time-varying media, where optical properties change over time, on electromagnetic wave propagation, focusing on plane waves and free-electron evanescent waves. We introduce a switching parameter, $\tau$, to model ultrafast switching in the femtosecond to nanosecond range. For plane-wave incidence at angular frequency $\omega_0$, we derive a generalized expression for the backward-to-forward flux ratio as a function of $\omega_0$ and $\tau$, aligning with recent experimental data and providing a unified interpretation framework. For free-electron incidence, we observe intensity saturation in temporal transition radiation at $I_{\textrm{max}}$ for $\tau \leq \tau_{\textrm{0}}$, with both $I_{\textrm{max}}$ and $\tau_{\textrm{0}}$ depending on electron speed. These results highlight the importance of precise $\tau$ control in experiments to probe time-varying media effectively.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Ultrafast Nonlinear Photothermal and Photoacoustic Effects in Molecular Thin Films via Time-Domain Brillouin Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency of photothermal (PT) therapies and photoacoustic (PA) imaging at the microscopic scale hinges on developing multiphoton-absorbing photothermal molecules or contrast agents that operate in the near-infrared (NIR) range. These advanced agents or molecules will enable excitation with NIR lasers, in an improved transparency range for biological tissues, while enabling minute, highly localized spatial control of the excitation area. However, progress in this field requires innovative experimental techniques to characterize photothermal and photoacoustic effects under multiphoton excitation. In this article, we showcase a study of a model organometallic molecular compound excited via two-photon absorption (2PA) using femtosecond laser pulses. Based on a time-domain Brillouin scattering technique, well adapted for investigating ultrafast nonlinear optical absorption processes in ultrathin films on substrates, we determine the effective nonlinear absorption coefficients of the compound directly linked to PT/PA. Our findings provide a practical approach for exploring and optimizing nonlinear PT/PA absorbers and contrast agents.</description>

      <title>Observation of Strong Nonreciprocal Thermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirchhoff`s law of thermal radiation stating the equivalence of emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength, angle, and polarization, has completely constrained emission and absorption processes. Achieving strong nonreciprocal emission points to fundamental advances for applications such as energy harvesting, heat transfer, and sensing, but strong nonreciprocal thermal emission has not been experimentally realized. Here, we observe strong nonreciprocal thermal emission using a custom-designed angle-resolved magnetic thermal emission spectroscopy and an epitaxially-transferred gradient-doped metamaterial. We show that under magnetic field, the metamaterial strongly breaks the Kirchhoff`s law, with a difference between emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength and angle reaching as high as 0.43. Significant nonreciprocal emission persists over broad spectral and angular ranges. The demonstration of strong nonreciprocal thermal emission and the approach can be useful for systematic exploration of nonreciprocal thermal photonics for thermal management, infrared camouflage, and energy conversion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the characterisation of anti-resonant hollow core optical fibres guiding at least 50 spatial modes in the infrared. Their propagation losses were measured to be between 0.1 and 0.2 dB/m from 1000 to 1500 nm wavelength, with bend losses of less than 3 dB/turn for bend radii of 7.5 cm despite core radii greater than 60 times the guided wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Eigenmodes of latent-symmetric quantum photonic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of latent symmetries on the dynamics of photonic systems and their eigenmodes. Residing solely within the eigenspectral domain, latent symmetries are not visible in real space, yet promise intriguing new ways to engineer the functionality of photonic systems. We study the eigenmodes of a 9-site latent-symmetric photonic network and find that an anti-symmetric input state is fundamentally precluded from populating so-called singlet sites. Furthermore, arbitrary extensions of the system at these sites do not break its latent symmetry. Therefore anti-symmetric excitations cannot leave the initial system, which can be leveraged e.g. for the storage of information. This holds true for both single-photon states, or classical light, as well as both distinguishable and indistinguishable two-photon quantum states. Latent symmetries introduce a powerful new set of tools to the design of systems with desired functionality on any nanophotonic platform, paving the way for applications in photonic information processing.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional polarization of fields radiated by partially coherent electromagnetic cylindrical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially coherent electromagnetic sources with cylindrical symmetry and infinite extent radiating outwards are introduced. Their $3\times3$ cross-spectral density matrix is given through expansions of the field components in terms of basis functions related to the Hankel functions. The spectral density and the three-dimensional degree of polarization of such sources and the fields they radiate are examined. Several examples are presented and discussed. Among them, a class of cylindrical sources whose coherent vector modes coincide with the above basis functions is defined and studied.</description>

      <title>Real-time Terahertz Compressive Optical-Digital Neural Network Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band has recently garnered significant attention due to its exceptional capabilities in non-invasive, non-destructive sensing, and imaging applications. However, current THz imaging systems encounter substantial challenges owing to hardware limitations, which result in information loss and restricted imaging throughput during data digitization and information extraction processes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid compressive optical-digital neural network designed to facilitate both real-time THz imaging and precise object information extraction. This approach utilizes a physical encoder, an optical neural network (ONN), to transform and reduce the dimensionality of physical signals, effectively compressing them to fit the physical constraints of THz sensor arrays. After the compressed signals are captured and digitized by the THz sensor array, a jointly trained digital neural network (DNN) reconstructs the signals into their desired or original form. Our proposed THz ONN-DNN computational imaging system demonstrates enhanced imaging quality, an expanded field of view with a lens-free system, diffraction-free imaging capability, and real-time THz video capture at a rate of two frames per second.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Principles, Engineering and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters, molecular-sized complexes releasing a single photon at a time, have garnered much attention owing to their use as a key building block in various quantum technologies. Among these, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as front runners with superior attributes compared to other competing platforms. These attributes are attainable thanks to the robust, two-dimensional lattice of the material formed by the extremely strong B-N bonds. This review discusses the fundamental properties of quantum emitters in hBN and highlights recent progress in the field. The focus is on the fabrication and engineering of these quantum emitters facilitated by state-of-the-art equipment. Strategies to integrate the quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic cavities to enhance their optical properties are summarized. The latest developments in new classes of spin-active defects, their predicted structural configurations, and the proposed suitable quantum applications are examined. Despite the current challenges, quantum emitters in hBN have steadily become a promising platform for applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Is there a conflict between causality and diamagnetism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a handful of other seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in optical media.</description>

      <title>Single-shot volumetric fluorescence imaging with neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-shot volumetric fluorescence (SVF) imaging offers a significant advantage over traditional imaging methods that require scanning across multiple axial planes as it can capture biological processes with high temporal resolution. The key challenges in SVF imaging include requiring sparsity constraints, eliminating depth ambiguity in the reconstruction, and maintaining high resolution across a large field of view. In this paper, we introduce the QuadraPol point spread function (PSF) combined with neural fields, a novel approach for SVF imaging. This method utilizes a custom polarizer at the back focal plane and a polarization camera to detect fluorescence, effectively encoding the 3D scene within a compact PSF without depth ambiguity. Additionally, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the neural fields technique that provides improved reconstruction quality compared to classical deconvolution methods. QuadraPol PSF, combined with neural fields, significantly reduces the acquisition time of a conventional fluorescence microscope by approximately 20 times and captures a 100 mm$^3$ cubic volume in one shot. We validate the effectiveness of both our hardware and algorithm through all-in-focus imaging of bacterial colonies on sand surfaces and visualization of plant root morphology. Our approach offers a powerful tool for advancing biological research and ecological studies.</description>

      <title>Universal programmable and self-configuring optical filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to integrated optical spectral filtering that allows arbitrary programmability, can compensate automatically for imperfections in filter fabrication, allows multiple simultaneous and separately programmable filter functions on the same input, and can configure itself automatically to the problem of interest, for example to filter or reject multiple arbitrarily chosen frequencies. The approach exploits splitting the input light into an array of multiple waveguides of different lengths that then feed a programmable interferometer array that can also self-configure. It can give spectral response similar to arrayed waveguide gratings but offers many other filtering functions, as well as supporting other structures based on non-redundant arrays for precise spectral filtering. Simultaneous filtering also allows, for the first time to our knowledge, an automatic measurement of the temporal coherency matrix and physical separation into the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of temporally partially coherent light fields.</description>

      <title>Fiber Optics in Curved Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.</description>
