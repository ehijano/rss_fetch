      <title>Equity Markets Volatility, Regime Dependence and Economic Uncertainty: The Case of Pacific Basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between the market volatility of the iShares Asia 50 ETF (AIA) and economic and market sentiment indicators from the United States, China, and globally during periods of economic uncertainty. Specifically, it examines the association between AIA volatility and key indicators such as the US Economic Uncertainty Index (ECU), the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU), China's Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPUCH), the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (GEPU), and the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index (VIX), spanning the years 2007 to 2023. Employing methodologies such as the two-covariate GARCH-MIDAS model, regime-switching Markov Chain (MSR), and quantile regressions (QR), the study explores the regime-dependent dynamics between AIA volatility and economic/market sentiment, taking into account investors' sensitivity to market uncertainties across different regimes. The findings reveal that the relationship between realized volatility and sentiment varies significantly between high- and low-volatility regimes, reflecting differences in investors' responses to market uncertainties under these conditions. Additionally, a weak association is observed between short-term volatility and economic/market sentiment indicators, suggesting that these indicators may have limited predictive power, especially during high-volatility regimes. The QR results further demonstrate the robustness of MSR estimates across most quantiles. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between market volatility and economic/market sentiment, offering practical implications for investors and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Increasing Systemic Resilience to Socioeconomic Challenges: Modeling the Dynamics of Liquidity Flows and Systemic Risks Using Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern economic systems face unprecedented socioeconomic challenges, making systemic resilience and effective liquidity flow management essential. Traditional models such as CAPM, VaR, and GARCH often fail to reflect real market fluctuations and extreme events. This study develops and validates an innovative mathematical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations, aimed at the quantitative assessment, forecasting, and simulation of liquidity flows and systemic risks. The model incorporates 13 macroeconomic and financial parameters, including liquidity velocity, market pressure, internal stress, stochastic fluctuations, and risk premiums, all based on real data and formally included in the modified equation. The methodology employs econometric testing, Fourier analysis, stochastic simulation, and AI-based calibration to enable dynamic testing and forecasting. Simulation-based sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of parameter changes on financial balance. The model is empirically tested using Georgian macroeconomic and financial data from 2010-2024, including GDP, inflation, the Gini index, CDS spreads, and LCR metrics. Results show that the model effectively describes liquidity dynamics, systemic risk, and extreme scenarios, while also offering a robust framework for multifactorial analysis, crisis prediction, and countercyclical policy planning.</description>

      <title>A Quantile Nelson-Siegel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for modeling the yield curve from a quantile perspective. Building on the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model of Diebold et al. (2006), we extend its traditional mean-based approach to a quantile regression setting, enabling the estimation of yield curve factors - level, slope, and curvature - at specific quantiles of the conditional distribution. A key advantage of our framework is its ability to characterize the entire conditional distribution of the yield curve across maturities and over time. In an empirical analysis of the U.S. term structure of interest rates, our method demonstrates superior out-of-sample forecasting performance, particularly in capturing the tails of the yield distribution - an aspect increasingly emphasized in the recent literature on distributional forecasting. In addition to its forecasting advantages, our approach reveals rich distributional features beyond the mean. In particular, we find that the dynamic changes in these distributional features differ markedly between the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic period, highlighting a fundamental shift in how interest rate markets respond to distinct economic shocks.</description>
