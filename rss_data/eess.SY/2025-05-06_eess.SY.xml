      <title>A Decision-Focused Predict-then-Bid Framework for Strategic Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01551v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel decision-focused framework for energy storage arbitrage bidding. Inspired by the bidding process for energy storage in electricity markets, we propose a predict-then-bid end-to-end method incorporating the storage arbitrage optimization and market clearing models. This is achieved through a tri-layer framework that combines a price prediction layer with a two-stage optimization problem: an energy storage optimization layer and a market-clearing optimization layer. We leverage the implicit function theorem for gradient computation in the first optimization layer and incorporate a perturbation-based approach into the decision-focused loss function to ensure differentiability in the market-clearing layer. Numerical experiments using electricity market data from New York demonstrate that our bidding design substantially outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest profits and showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Coordinated Routing Approach for Enhancing Bus Timeliness and Travel Efficiency in Mixed-Traffic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a coordinated routing strategy aimed at improving bus schedule adherence and enhancing travel efficiency for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) operating within a mixed-traffic urban network. Our approach capitalizes on the existence of dedicated lanes for buses and CAVs, leveraging real-time traffic data to dynamically reroute CAVs in anticipation of congestion. By continuously monitoring traffic conditions on dedicated lanes and tracking the real-time positions of buses, we enable the system to proactively adjust CAV routes when potential interference with bus operations is detected. This coordination mitigates delays affecting transit services and reduces travel time for CAVs. We evaluate the proposed strategy through simulation studies conducted in the SUMO. The results demonstrate significant improvements in both transit reliability and CAV operational performance across a range of traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Learning for Passivity-based Tracking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passivity-based control ensures system stability by leveraging dissipative properties and is widely applied in electrical and mechanical systems. Port-Hamiltonian systems (PHS), in particular, are well-suited for interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) due to their structured, energy-centric modeling approach. However, current IDA-PBC faces two key challenges: (i) it requires precise system knowledge, which is often unavailable due to model uncertainties, and (ii) it is typically limited to set-point control. To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven tracking control approach based on a physics-informed model, namely Gaussian process Port-Hamiltonian systems, along with the modified matching equation. By leveraging the Bayesian nature of the model, we establish probabilistic stability and passivity guarantees. A simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Practitioner's Guide to Automatic Kernel Search for Gaussian Processes in Battery Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) models have been used in a wide range of battery applications, in which different kernels were manually selected with considerable expertise. However, to capture complex relationships in the ever-growing amount of real-world data, selecting a suitable kernel for the GP model in battery applications is increasingly challenging. In this work, we first review existing GP kernels used in battery applications and then extend an automatic kernel search method with a new base kernel and model selection criteria. The GP models with composite kernels outperform the baseline kernel in two numerical examples of battery applications, i.e., battery capacity estimation and residual load prediction. Particularly, the results indicate that the Bayesian Information Criterion may be the best model selection criterion as it achieves a good trade-off between kernel performance and computational complexity. This work should, therefore, be of value to practitioners wishing to automate their kernel search process in battery applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Prediction Model for Time Series Characterized by GARCH via Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GARCH-type time series (characterized by Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) exhibit pronounced volatility, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity. To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Flexibility Aggregation Using LinDistFlow Model with Loss Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing integration of renewable energy resources and the growing need for data privacy between system operators, flexibility aggregation methods have emerged as a promising solution to coordinate integrated transmissiondistribution (ITD) systems with limited information exchange. However, existing methods face significant challenges due to the nonlinearity of AC power flow models, and therefore mostly rely on linearized models. This paper examines the inherent errors in the LinDistFlow model, a linearized approximation, and demonstrates their impact on flexibility aggregation. To address these issues, we propose an intuitive compensation approach to refine the LinDistFlow-based flexibility set. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in efficiently coordinating ITD systems.</description>

      <title>Optimized Cascaded Position Control of BLDC Motors Considering Torque Ripple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brushless DC (BLDC) motors are increasingly used in various industries due to their reliability, low noise, and extended lifespan compared to traditional DC motors. Their high torque-to-weight ratio and impressive starting torque make them ideal for automotive, robotics, and industrial applications. This paper explores the multi-objective tuning of BLDC motor controllers, focusing on position and torque ripple. A state-space model of the BLDC motor and the entire control system, including the power stage and control structure, is developed in the Simulink environment. Two common control mechanisms, trapezoidal and Field Oriented Control (FOC), are implemented and optimized. Both mechanisms utilize a cascaded closed-loop position control, providing fair disturbance rejection but requiring challenging tuning of the controllers. To address these challenges, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used for optimization. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of optimization techniques in enhancing the performance of control systems.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Resilient Distributed Single Time-Scale Estimators: A Graph-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed estimation in interconnected systems has gained increasing attention due to its relevance in diverse applications such as sensor networks, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing. In real practice, the sensor network may suffer from communication and/or sensor failures. This might be due to cyber-attacks, faults, or environmental conditions. Distributed estimation resilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the sensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we introduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed estimators. As compared to the literature, the proposed estimator (i) relaxes the network connectivity of most existing single time-scale estimators and (ii) reduces the communication load of the existing double time-scale estimators by avoiding the inner consensus loop.
  On the other hand, the sensors might be subject to faults or attacks, resulting in biased measurements. Removing these sensor data may result in observability loss. Therefore, we propose resilient design on the definitions of $q$-node-connectivity and $q$-link-connectivity, which capture robust strong-connectivity under link or sensor node failure. By proper design of the sensor network, we prove Schur stability of the proposed distributed estimation protocol under failure of up to $q$ sensors or $q$ communication links.</description>

      <title>Multiple Receiver Over-the-Air Computation for Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-sender, multi-receiver over-the-air computation (OAC) framework for wireless networked control systems (WNCS) with structural constraints. Our approach enables actuators to directly compute and apply control signals from sensor measurements, eliminating the need for a centralized controller. We use an iterative and convexifying procedure to obtain a control law that is structured with respect to the network topology and minimizes the overall system energy-to-energy gain. Furthermore, we solve a constrained matrix factorization problem to find the optimal OAC configuration with respect to power consumption, robustness, and stability of the WNCS. We prove the convergence of our proposed algorithms and present numerical results that validate our approach to preserve closed-loop stability with robust control performance and constrained power.</description>

      <title>Evaluating an assembly- and disassembly-oriented expansion of Modular Function Deployment through a workshop-based assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular product architectures are used to enhance flexibility, reduce production complexity, and support sustainability goals. However, traditional Modular Function Deployment (MFD) method does not fully integrate Design for Assembly (DFA) and Design for Disassembly (DFD) principles, leading to sub-optimal manufacturability and end-of-life strategies. This study introduces an expanded MFD method incorporating assembly and disassembly considerations into early-stage modularisation. A workshop-based evaluation assesses usability and applicability, involving participants using standard and expanded MFD. Results indicate that integrating DFA and DFD enhances assembly efficiency, ease of disassembly, and modular product strategy alignment. However, usability challenges were identified, necessitating refinements for industry application.</description>

      <title>Adaptive DRL for IRS Mirror Orientation in Dynamic OWC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate line-of-sight (LoS) blockages and enhance signal coverage in optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. In this work, we consider a mirror-based IRS to assist a dynamic indoor visible light communication (VLC) environment. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate by adjusting the orientation of the IRS mirrors. To enable real-time adaptability, the problem is modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, specifically deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is employed to optimize mirror orientation toward mobile users under blockage and mobility constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDPG-based approach outperforms conventional DRL algorithms and achieves substantial improvements in sum rate compared to fixed-orientation IRS configurations.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Aided Frequency Control of LCC-S Resonant Converters for Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based control strategy for achieving precise and robust output voltage regulation in LCC-S resonant converters, specifically designed for wireless power transfer applications. Unlike conventional methods that rely on manually tuned PI controllers or heuristic tuning approaches, our method leverages the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to systematically optimize PI controller parameters. The complex converter dynamics are captured using the Direct Piecewise Affine (DPWA) modeling technique, providing a structured approach to handling its nonlinearities. This integration not only eliminates the need for manual tuning, but also enhances control adaptability under varying operating conditions. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed DRL-based tuning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of stability, robustness, and response time. This work demonstrates the potential of DRL in power electronic control, offering a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional controller design approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a novel design of electromagnetically reconfigurable antennas (ERAs) based on a fluid antenna system (FAS) is proposed, and the corresponding wireless channel model is established. Different from conventional antenna arrays with static elements, the electromagnetic characteristics of each array element in the proposed ERA can be flexibly reconfigured into various states, introducing electromagnetic degrees of freedom to enhance wireless system performance. Based on the proposed ERA design, the corresponding channel model is developed. Finally, full-wave simulations are conducted to validate the overall design concept. The results reveal that a gain enhancement of 2.5 dB is achieved at a beamforming direction.</description>

      <title>Inverse Modeling of Dielectric Response in Time Domain using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric response (DR) of insulating materials is key input information for designing electrical insulation systems and defining safe operating conditions of various HV devices. In dielectric materials, different polarization and conduction processes occur at different time scales, making it challenging to physically interpret raw measured data. To analyze DR measurement results, equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are commonly used, reducing the complexity of the physical system to a number of circuit elements that capture the dominant response. This paper examines the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inverse modeling of DR in time domain using parallel RC circuits. To assess their performance, we test PINNs on synthetic data generated from analytical solutions of corresponding ECMs, incorporating Gaussian noise to simulate measurement errors. Our results show that PINNs are highly effective at solving well-conditioned inverse problems, accurately estimating up to five unknown RC parameters with minimal requirements on neural network size, training duration, and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we extend the ECMs to incorporate temperature dependence and demonstrate that PINNs can accurately recover embedded, nonlinear temperature functions from noisy DR data sampled at different temperatures. This case study in modeling DR in time domain presents a solution with wide-ranging potential applications in disciplines relying on ECMs, utilizing the latest technology in machine learning for scientific computation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Transceiver Selection on Synchronization Accuracy in White Rabbit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving optimal synchronization accuracy between two White Rabbit devices hinges on the proper selection of transceivers, which act as electro-optical converters connecting WR devices to the optical network infrastructure. The correct choice of transceivers can significantly improve resilience to changes in the time offset between WR devices due to temperature fluctuations in the connecting optical fiber. To compare the performance of BiDi WDM and DWDM transceivers, an experimental setup was established under laboratory conditions to simulate a real optical network used for distributing precise time and frequency between two remote locations. The optical connection was emulated by integrating a 20 km G.652.D optical fiber into a climatic chamber, which provided variable environmental conditions similar to those experienced in real applications. The study compared BiDi WDM 1310/1550 nm transceivers with DWDM Ch33/Ch34 transceivers. Results showed that DWDM transceivers exhibited nearly thirteen times less sensitivity to temperature-induced changes in the optical connection, leading to a smaller time offset. Therefore, for achieving the highest accuracy in synchronizing WR devices in practical applications, DWDM transceiver technology is essential.</description>

      <title>Maximal Compatibility Matching for Preference-Aware Ride-Hailing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Maximal Compatibility Matching (MCM) framework, a novel assignment strategy for ride-hailing systems that explicitly incorporates passenger comfort into the matching process. Traditional assignment methods prioritize spatial efficiency, but often overlook behavioral alignment between passengers and drivers, which can significantly impact user satisfaction. MCM addresses this gap by learning personalized passenger comfort zones using gradient-boosted decision tree classifiers trained on labeled ride data, and by modeling driver behavior through empirical operating profiles constructed from time-series driving features. Compatibility between a passenger and a driver is computed as the closed-form volume of intersection between their respective feature-space regions. These compatibility scores are integrated into a utility-based matching algorithm that balances comfort and proximity through a tunable trade-off parameter. We validate the framework using a Unity-based driving simulator with real-time passenger feedback, demonstrating that MCM enables more personalized and socially acceptable matchings while maintaining high levels of operational performance.</description>

      <title>Wise Goose Chase: A Predictive Path Planning Algorithm for Dynamic Rebalancing in Ride-Hailing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional rebalancing methods in ride-hailing systems direct idle drivers to fixed destinations, overlooking the fact that ride allocations frequently occur while cruising. This destination-centric view fails to exploit the path-dependent nature of modern platforms, where real-time matching depends on the entire trajectory rather than a static endpoint. We propose the Wise Goose Chase (WGC) algorithm, an event-triggered, driver-specific path planning framework that anticipates future matching opportunities by forecasting spatio-temporal supply and demand dynamics. WGC uses a system of Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs) to model the evolution of idle driver density and passenger queues at the road-segment level, incorporating both en-route matching and competition among drivers. Upon request, WGC computes personalized cruising paths that minimize each driver's expected time to allocation. Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic urban networks show that WGC consistently outperforms baseline strategies, highlighting the advantage of predictive, context-aware rebalancing in dynamic mobility systems.</description>

      <title>Online Phase Estimation of Human Oscillatory Motions using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the phase of oscillatory systems is essential for analyzing cyclic activities such as repetitive gestures in human motion. In this work we introduce a learning-based approach for online phase estimation in three-dimensional motion trajectories, using a Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) network. A calibration procedure is applied to standardize trajectory position and orientation, ensuring invariance to spatial variations. The proposed model is evaluated on motion capture data and further tested in a dynamical system, where the estimated phase is used as input to a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control to assess its impact on the synchronization of a network of Kuramoto oscillators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the principles of designing new self-organising and autonomous management protocol to govern the dynamics of bio-inspired decentralized firewall architecture based on Biological Regularity Networks.
  The new architecture called Firewall Regulatory Networks (FRN) exhibits the following features (1) automatic rule policy configuration with provable utility-risk appetite guarantee, (2) resilient response for changing risks or new service requirements, and (3) globally optimized access control policy reconciliation. We present the FRN protocol and formalize the constraints to synthesize the undetermined components in the protocol to produce interactions that can achieve these objectives. We illustrate the feasibility of the FRN architecture in multiple case studies.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient CAV Lane Changing using Decentralised Safety Shields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities, such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable average speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.</description>

      <title>Embedded System for Recording and Controlling Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, more effective control of hand hygiene (HH) by healthcare teams has become essential. HH control is crucial to prevent cross-contamination and healthcare-associated infections (HAI), according to Brazilian regulatory standards and WHO guidelines. The lack of widespread technology to measure acceptable hygiene rates within hospital environments leads to the practice of a manual sample audit reading, requiring more time for decision making. Thus, the present study addresses the lack of automation technologies for HH, aiming to record, measure, and provide data for internal audits in hospitals. This article introduces an embedded system for HH control and recording, comprising low-cost hardware architecture with IoT connectivity and online monitoring. Results with practical evaluation in a real hospital setting for 3 hours demonstrated the system's effectiveness in recording HH indices.</description>

      <title>High Speed Robotic Table Tennis Swinging Using Lightweight Hardware with Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a robotic table tennis platform that achieves a variety of hit styles and ball-spins with high precision, power, and consistency. This is enabled by a custom lightweight, high-torque, low rotor inertia, five degree-of-freedom arm capable of high acceleration. To generate swing trajectories, we formulate an optimal control problem (OCP) that constrains the state of the paddle at the time of the strike. The terminal position is given by a predicted ball trajectory, and the terminal orientation and velocity of the paddle are chosen to match various possible styles of hits: loops (topspin), drives (flat), and chops (backspin). Finally, we construct a fixed-horizon model predictive controller (MPC) around this OCP to allow the hardware to quickly react to changes in the predicted ball trajectory. We validate on hardware that the system is capable of hitting balls with an average exit velocity of 11 m/s at an 88% success rate across the three swing types.</description>

      <title>Real-Time, Single-Ear, Wearable ECG Reconstruction, R-Peak Detection, and HR/HRV Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biosignal monitoring, in particular heart activity through heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) tracking, is vital in enabling continuous, non-invasive tracking of physiological and cognitive states. Recent studies have explored compact, head-worn devices for HR and HRV monitoring to improve usability and reduce stigma. However, this approach is challenged by the current reliance on wet electrodes, which limits usability, the weakness of ear-derived signals, making HR/HRV extraction more complex, and the incompatibility of current algorithms for embedded deployment. This work introduces a single-ear wearable system for real-time ECG (Electrocardiogram) parameter estimation, which directly runs on BioGAP, an energy-efficient device for biosignal acquisition and processing. By combining SoA in-ear electrode technology, an optimized DeepMF algorithm, and BioGAP, our proposed subject-independent approach allows for robust extraction of HR/HRV parameters directly on the device with just 36.7 uJ/inference at comparable performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art architecture, achieving 0.49 bpm and 25.82 ms for HR/HRV mean errors, respectively and an estimated battery life of 36h with a total system power consumption of 7.6 mW. Clinical relevance: The ability to reconstruct ECG signals and extract HR and HRV paves the way for continuous, unobtrusive cardiovascular monitoring with head-worn devices. In particular, the integration of cardiovascular measurements in everyday-use devices (such as earbuds) has potential in continuous at-home monitoring to enable early detection of cardiovascular irregularities.</description>

      <title>Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed ISAC Systems: An Autoencoder Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation, compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources are reallocated to high-noise sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for designing finite-horizon discrete-valued switching signals in linear switched systems based on discreteness-promoting regularization. The inherent combinatorial optimization problem is reformulated as a continuous optimization problem with a non-convex regularization term that promotes discreteness of the control. We prove that any solution obtained from the relaxed problem is also a solution to the original problem. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved through time discretization. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of the Augmented Lagrangian Dual in Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the general linearly constrained optimization problem: $\min_{x \in \R^d} f(x) \ \st \ A x = b$, where $f: \R^n \rightarrow \exs$ is a closed proper convex function, $A \in \R^{p \times d}$, and $b \in \R^p$. We establish the following results without requiring additional regularity conditions: (1) the augmented Lagrangian dual function $\phi_{\rho}(\lambda) = \inf_x \cL_{\rho}(x, \lambda)$ is $\frac{1}{\rho}$-smooth everywhere; and (2) the solution to $\min_{x \in \R^d} \cL_{\rho}(x, \lambda)$ exists for any dual variable $\lambda \in \R^p$, where $\rho &gt; 0$ is the augmented parameter and $\cL_{\rho}(x, \lambda) = f(x) + \dotprod{\lambda, A x - b} + \frac{\rho}{2}\norm{A x - b}^2$ is the augmented Lagrangian. These findings significantly relax the strong assumptions commonly imposed in existing literature to guarantee similar properties.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive Multiphysics model for zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), incorporating electrochemical aspects. The model integrates the mass transport of Zn2+ ions, charge transfer, and solid diffusion to predict performance parameters like cell potential, and energy density. Significant research has focused on enhancing battery performance by optimizing components of battery to improve parameters such as ionic conductivity and exchange current density and capacity. In this study, we present a model-based investigation of zinc-ion batteries, examining the impact of these parameters. Our findings reveal that at low current densities, raising of ionic conductivity beyond 1.3 S/m and exchange current density above 0.13 mA/cm2 do not yield substantial improvements in capacity. These insights underscore the importance of identifying performance thresholds in the development of next-generation batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes present a promising solution to the challenges posed by aqueous electrolytes in energy storage systems, offering the flexibility needed for wearable electronics. Despite the increasing interest in polymer electrolyte-based zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), their development is still in its early stages due to various challenges. In this study, we fabricated three promising polymer electrolytes: CSAM (carboxyl methyl chitosan with acrylamide monomer), PAM (polyacrylamide monomer hydrogel electrolyte), and p-PBI (Phosphoric acid (PA)-doped polybenzimidazole) with Zn(ClO4)2 and Zn(OTf)2, for their application in zinc ion batteries. Our results demonstrated that PAM hydrogel electrolyte exhibited very low LDH formation after a long cycle, demonstrating effective protection for zinc foil, and the high mechanical stability of the p-PBI membrane provided prolonged durability against short circuits through the formation of LDH. The presence of carboxyl groups in CSAM and the formation of O-H bonding facilitated ion movement, resulting in enhanced ionic conductivity, and preventing dendrite formation. Incorporating these hydrogels with high-performance zinc salts, such as zinc triflate (Zn(OTf)2), resulted in impressive stability, with the symmetric cell demonstrating over 4000 hours of uniform and stable voltage profile under 1 mA/cm2 and low overpotential of around 53 mV cycling with CSAM. The full-cell battery with PBI-T membrane showed the highest durability and capacity compared to CSAM-T and PAM-T, due to the greater availability of free protons for storing zinc in the cathode.</description>

      <title>OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition, $30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a limited extent.</description>

      <title>Triple-identity Authentication: The Future of Secure Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a typical authentication process, the local system verifies the user's identity using a stored hash value generated by a cross-system hash algorithm. This article shifts the research focus from traditional password encryption to the establishment of gatekeeping mechanisms for effective interactions between a system and the outside world. Here, we propose a triple-identity authentication system to achieve this goal. Specifically, this local system opens the inner structure of its hash algorithm to all user credentials, including the login name, login password, and authentication password. When a login credential is entered, the local system hashes it and then creates a unique identifier using intermediate hash elements randomly selected from the open algorithm. Importantly, this locally generated unique identifier (rather than the stored hash produced by the open algorithm) is utilized to verify the user's combined identity, which is generated by combining the entered credential with the International Mobile Equipment Identity and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity. The verification process is implemented at each interaction point: the login name field, the login password field, and the server's authentication point. Thus, within the context of this triple-identity authentication system, we establish a robust gatekeeping mechanism for system interactions, ultimately providing a level of security that is equivalent to multi-factor authentication.</description>

      <title>Dual Acceleration for Minimax Optimization: Linear Convergence Under Relaxed Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the bilinearly coupled minimax optimization problem: $\min_{x \in \R^{d_x}}\max_{y \in \R^{d_y}} \ f_1(x) + f_2(x) + y\T Bx - g_1(y) - g_2(y)$, where $f_1$ and $g_1$ are smooth convex functions, $f_2$ and $g_2$ are potentially nonsmooth convex functions, and $B$ is a coupling matrix. Existing algorithms for solving this problem achieve linear convergence only under stronger conditions, which may not be met in many scenarios. We first introduce the Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient (PDPG) method and demonstrate that it converges linearly under an assumption where existing algorithms fail to achieve linear convergence. Building on insights gained from analyzing the convergence conditions of existing algorithms and PDPG, we further propose the inexact Dual Accelerated Proximal Gradient (iDAPG) method. This method achieves linear convergence under weaker conditions than those required by existing approaches. Moreover, even in cases where existing methods guarantee linear convergence, iDAPG can still provide superior theoretical performance in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>CONQURE: A Co-Execution Environment for Quantum and Classical Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cutting edge classical computing today relies on a combination of CPU-based computing with a strong reliance on accelerators. In particular, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) rely heavily on acceleration via GPUs for numerical kernels. In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources. CONQURE is a fully open-source cloud queue framework that presents a novel modular scheduling framework allowing users to offload OpenMP quantum kernels to QPUs as quantum circuits, to relay results back to calling contexts in classical computing, and to schedule quantum resources via our CONQURE API. We show our API has a low overhead averaging 12.7ms in our tests, and we demonstrate functionality on an ion-trap device. Our OpenMP extension enables the parallelization of VQE runs with a 3.1X reduction in runtime.</description>

      <title>Resolving Conflicting Constraints in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Layered Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preventing collisions in multi-robot navigation is crucial for deployment. This requirement hinders the use of learning-based approaches, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), on their own due to their lack of safety guarantees. Traditional control methods, such as reachability and control barrier functions, can provide rigorous safety guarantees when interactions are limited only to a small number of robots. However, conflicts between the constraints faced by different agents pose a challenge to safe multi-agent coordination.
  To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that integrates multiple layers of safety by combining MARL with safety filters. First, MARL is used to learn strategies that minimize multiple agent interactions, where multiple indicates more than two. Particularly, we focus on interactions likely to result in conflicting constraints within the engagement distance. Next, for agents that enter the engagement distance, we prioritize pairs requiring the most urgent corrective actions. Finally, a dedicated safety filter provides tactical corrective actions to resolve these conflicts. Crucially, the design decisions for all layers of this framework are grounded in reachability analysis and a control barrier-value function-based filtering mechanism.
  We validate our Layered Safe MARL framework in 1) hardware experiments using Crazyflie drones and 2) high-density advanced aerial mobility (AAM) operation scenarios, where agents navigate to designated waypoints while avoiding collisions. The results show that our method significantly reduces conflict while maintaining safety without sacrificing much efficiency (i.e., shorter travel time and distance) compared to baselines that do not incorporate layered safety.

      <title>Riemannian Direct Trajectory Optimization of Rigid Bodies on Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing dynamically feasible trajectories for rigid bodies is a fundamental problem in robotics. Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Filter for Motion Planning with Arbitrary Road Boundary Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time safety filter for motion planning, such as learning-based methods, using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), which provides formal guarantees for collision avoidance with road boundaries. A key feature of our approach is its ability to directly incorporate road geometries of arbitrary shape without resorting to conservative overapproximations. We formulate the safety filter as a constrained optimization problem in the form of a Quadratic Program (QP). It achieves safety by making minimal, necessary adjustments to the control actions issued by the nominal motion planner. We validate our safety filter through extensive numerical experiments across a variety of traffic scenarios featuring complex roads. The results confirm its reliable safety and high computational efficiency (execution frequency up to 40 Hz). Code &amp; Video Demo: github.com/bassamlab/SigmaRL</description>

      <title>Quadrupedal Spine Control Strategies: Exploring Correlations Between System Dynamic Responses and Human Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike their biological cousins, the majority of existing quadrupedal robots are constructed with rigid chassis. This results in motion that is either beetle-like or distinctly robotic, lacking the natural fluidity characteristic of mammalian movements. Existing literature on quadrupedal robots with spinal configurations primarily focuses on energy efficiency and does not consider the effects in human-robot interaction scenarios. Our contributions include an initial investigation into various trajectory generation strategies for a quadrupedal robot with a four degree of freedom spine, and an analysis on the effect that such methods have on human perception of gait naturalness compared to a fixed spine baseline. The strategies were evaluated using videos of walking, trotting and turning simulations. Among the four different strategies developed, the optimised time varying and the foot-tracking strategies were perceived to be more natural than the baseline in a randomised trial with 50 participants. Although none of the strategies demonstrated any energy efficiency improvements over the no-spine baseline, some showed greater footfall consistency at higher speeds. Given the greater likeability drawn from the more natural locomotion patterns, this type of robot displays potential for applications in social robot scenarios such as elderly care, where energy efficiency is not a primary concern.</description>

      <title>ReeM: Ensemble Building Thermodynamics Model for Efficient HVAC Control via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ZeloS, a research platform designed and built for practical validation of automated driving methods in an early stage of research. We overview ZeloS' hardware setup and automation architecture and focus on motion planning and control. ZeloS weighs 69 kg, measures a length of 117 cm, and is equipped with all-wheel steering, all-wheel drive, and various onboard sensors for localization. The hardware setup and the automation architecture of ZeloS are designed and built with a focus on modularity and the goal of being simple yet effective. The modular design allows the modification of individual automation modules without the need for extensive onboarding into the automation architecture. As such, this design supports ZeloS in being a versatile research platform for validating various automated driving methods. The motion planning component and control of ZeloS feature optimization-based methods that allow for explicitly considering constraints. We demonstrate the hardware and automation setup by presenting experimental data.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Energy Modeling of Industrial IoT Systems: A Benchmarking Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of IoT has driven the development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in industrial environments, leveraging Industrial IoTs (IIoTs) to automate manufacturing processes and enhance productivity. The transition to autonomous systems introduces significant operational costs, particularly in terms of energy consumption. Accurate modeling and prediction of IIoT energy requirements are critical, but traditional physics- and engineering-based approaches often fall short in addressing these challenges comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for benchmarking and analyzing IIoT devices and applications to uncover insights into their power demands, energy consumption, and performance. To demonstrate this methodology, we develop a comprehensive framework and apply it to study an industrial CPS comprising an educational robotic arm, a conveyor belt, a smart camera, and a compute node. By creating micro-benchmarks and an end-to-end application within this framework, we create an extensive performance and power consumption dataset, which we use to train and analyze ML models for predicting energy usage from features of the application and the CPS system. The proposed methodology and framework provide valuable insights into the energy dynamics of industrial CPS, offering practical implications for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of IIoT-driven automation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial hand amputations significantly affect the physical and psychosocial well-being of individuals, yet intuitive control of externally powered prostheses remains an open challenge. To address this gap, we developed a force-controlled prosthetic finger activated by electromyography (EMG) signals. The prototype, constructed around a wrist brace, functions as a supernumerary finger placed near the index, allowing for early-stage evaluation on unimpaired subjects. A neural network-based model was then implemented to estimate fingertip forces from EMG inputs, allowing for online adjustment of the prosthetic finger grip strength. The force estimation model was validated through experiments with ten participants, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting forces. Additionally, online trials with four users wearing the prosthesis exhibited precise control over the device. Our findings highlight the potential of using EMG-based force estimation to enhance the functionality of prosthetic fingers.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-Inertial SLAM-Based Navigation and Safety-Oriented AI-Driven Control System for Skid-Steer Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and stochastic technologies into the mobile robot navigation and control (MRNC) framework while adhering to rigorous safety standards presents significant challenges. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensively integrated MRNC framework for skid-steer wheeled mobile robots (SSWMRs), in which all components are actively engaged in real-time execution. The framework comprises: 1) a LiDAR-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm for estimating the current pose of the robot within the built map; 2) an effective path-following control system for generating desired linear and angular velocity commands based on the current pose and the desired pose; 3) inverse kinematics for transferring linear and angular velocity commands into left and right side velocity commands; and 4) a robust AI-driven (RAID) control system incorporating a radial basis function network (RBFN) with a new adaptive algorithm to enforce in-wheel actuation systems to track each side motion commands. To further meet safety requirements, the proposed RAID control within the MRNC framework of the SSWMR constrains AI-generated tracking performance within predefined overshoot and steady-state error limits, while ensuring robustness and system stability by compensating for modeling errors, unknown RBF weights, and external forces. Experimental results verify the proposed MRNC framework performance for a 4,836 kg SSWMR operating on soft terrain.</description>

      <title>Structured Estimators: A New Perspective on Information Freshness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent literature, when modeling for information freshness in remote estimation settings, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators, meaning the remote estimate at any time is equal to the most recently received update. This is mainly due to its simplicity and ease of analysis. However, these martingale estimators are far from optimal in some cases, especially in pull-based update systems. For such systems, maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimum, but can be challenging to analyze. Here, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which retain useful characteristics from a MAP estimate while still being analytically tractable. Our proposed estimators move seamlessly from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose conformal predictive programming (CPP), a framework to solve chance constrained optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems with constraints that are functions of random variables. CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Informed Deep Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02659</link>

Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to the net active and reactive power injections patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability, but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Defense Strategies for Autonomous Multi-agent Systems: Ensuring Safety and Resilience Under Exponentially Unbounded FDI Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: False data injection attacks pose a significant threat to autonomous multi-agent systems (MASs). Existing attack-resilient control strategies generally have strict assumptions on the attack signals and overlook safety constraints, such as collision avoidance. In practical applications, leader agents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a safe region to guide heterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated operations while addressing collision avoidance to prevent financial losses and mission failures. This letter addresses these gaps by introducing and solving the safety-aware and attack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel attack-resilient observer layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI attacks on the OL. Then, an attack-resilient compensational signal is designed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer (CIL). Finally, a SAAR controller is designed by solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem integrating control barrier function (CBF) certified collision-free safety constraints. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the SAAR controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience. This study also pioneers a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of the SAAR containment control problem for heterogeneous MASs, demonstrating its applicability in realistic multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review on Safety of the Intended Functionality for Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the automobile industry, ensuring the safety of automated vehicles equipped with the Automated Driving System (ADS) is becoming a significant focus due to the increasing development and deployment of automated driving. Automated driving depends on sensing both the external and internal environments of a vehicle, utilizing perception sensors and algorithms, and Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems for situational awareness and response. ISO 21448 is the standard for Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) that aims to ensure that the ADS operate safely within their intended functionality. SOTIF focuses on preventing or mitigating potential hazards that may arise from the limitations or failures of the ADS, including hazards due to insufficiencies of specification, or performance insufficiencies, as well as foreseeable misuse of the intended functionality. However, the challenge lies in ensuring the safety of vehicles despite the limited availability of extensive and systematic literature on SOTIF. To address this challenge, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on SOTIF for the ADS is performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The objective is to methodically gather and analyze the existing literature on SOTIF. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) presenting a summary of the literature by synthesizing and organizing the collective findings, methodologies, and insights into distinct thematic groups, and (ii) summarizing and categorizing the acknowledged limitations based on data extracted from an SLR of 51 research papers published between 2018 and 2023. Furthermore, research gaps are determined, and future research directions are proposed.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reachability Analysis for Piecewise Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid systems play a crucial role in modeling real-world applications where discrete and continuous dynamics interact, including autonomous vehicles, power systems, and traffic networks. Safety verification for these systems requires determining whether system states can enter unsafe regions under given initial conditions and uncertainties, a question directly addressed by reachability analysis. However, hybrid systems present unique difficulties because their state space is divided into multiple regions with distinct dynamic models, causing traditional data-driven methods to produce inadequate over-approximations of reachable sets at region boundaries where dynamics change abruptly. This paper introduces a novel approach using hybrid zonotopes for data-driven reachability analysis of piecewise affine systems. Our method addresses the boundary transition problem by developing computational algorithms that calculate the family of set models guaranteed to contain the true system trajectories. Additionally, we extend and evaluate three methods for set-based estimation that account for input-output data with measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks: A Peer-to-Peer ACIDE Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In mobile wireless networks, livestreaming in high user density areas presents two typical challenges: the wireless bandwidth is depleted and the number of users is limited. In this study, a media distribution model utilizing peer to peer communications, Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment, is proposed for bandwidth efficient livestreaming. The basic idea is to group users with identical livestream interest in a cluster of n peers. Instead of sending n copies of a livestream package, only one copy is sent to the cluster. A package is divided into n blocks. Each user receives one block from the base station and the remaining n-1 blocks from the other peers. Two optimization problems are addressed. The first problem is minimizing the bandwidth needed to guarantee a continuous live media play on all peers. A solution is proposed to find the optimal block sizes such that the wireless bandwidth is minimized. The second problem is maximizing the number of peers admitted to a cluster, given a fixed wireless bandwidth. This problem is NP-complete and a greedy strategy is proposed to calculate a feasible solution for peer selection. The proposed model improves the bandwidth efficiency and allows more users to be served.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Safety Guarantees in Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the integration of additional information sources into a Bayesian optimization framework while ensuring that safety constraints are satisfied. The interdependencies between these information sources are modeled using an unknown correlation matrix. We explore how uniform error bounds must be adjusted to maintain constraint satisfaction throughout the optimization process, considering both Bayesian and frequentist statistical perspectives. This is achieved by appropriately scaling the error bounds based on a confidence interval that can be estimated from the data. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark functions and a controller parameter optimization problem. Our results highlight a significant improvement in sample efficiency, demonstrating the methods suitability for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions.</description>

      <title>In vivo validation of Wireless Power Transfer System for Magnetically Controlled Robotic Capsule Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the in vivo validation of an inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) system integrated for the first time into a magnetically controlled robotic capsule endoscopy platform. The proposed system enables continuous power delivery to the capsule without the need for onboard batteries, thus extending operational time and reducing size constraints. The WPT system operates through a resonant inductive coupling mechanism, based on a transmitting coil mounted on the end effector of a robotic arm that also houses an external permanent magnet and a localization coil for precise capsule manipulation. To ensure robust and stable power transmission in the presence of coil misalignment and rotation, a 3D receiving coil is integrated within the capsule. Additionally, a closed-loop adaptive control system, based on load-shift keying (LSK) modulation, dynamically adjusts the transmitted power to optimize efficiency while maintaining compliance with specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits. The system has been extensively characterized in laboratory settings and validated through in vivo experiments using a porcine model, demonstrating reliable power transfer and effective robotic navigation in realistic gastrointestinal conditions: the average received power was 110 mW at a distance of 9 cm between the coils, with variable capsule rotation angles. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed WPT approach for autonomous, battery-free robotic capsule endoscopy, paving the way for enhanced diagnostic in gastrointestinal medicine.</description>

      <title>Safe Flow Matching: Robot Motion Planning with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have led to promising results in robot motion planning, particularly through diffusion and flow matching (FM)-based models that capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions. However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with new environments with constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, we propose Safe Flow Matching (SafeFlow), a motion planning framework, for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. SafeFlow leverages our proposed flow matching barrier functions (FMBF) to ensure the planned trajectories remain within safe regions across the entire planning horizon. Crucially, our approach enables training-free, real-time safety enforcement at test time, eliminating the need for retraining. We evaluate SafeFlow on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

      <title>Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.</description>

      <title>CarbonCall: Sustainability-Aware Function Calling for Large Language Models on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable real-time function calling in edge AI systems but introduce significant computational overhead, leading to high power consumption and carbon emissions. Existing methods optimize for performance while neglecting sustainability, making them inefficient for energy-constrained environments. We introduce CarbonCall, a sustainability-aware function-calling framework that integrates dynamic tool selection, carbon-aware execution, and quantized LLM adaptation. CarbonCall adjusts power thresholds based on real-time carbon intensity forecasts and switches between model variants to sustain high tokens-per-second throughput under power constraints. Experiments on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin show that CarbonCall reduces carbon emissions by up to 52%, power consumption by 30%, and execution time by 30%, while maintaining high efficiency.</description>
