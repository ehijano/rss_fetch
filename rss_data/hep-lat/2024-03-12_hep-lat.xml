      <title>f(R,T) Analogue Gravity in (2+1) D graphene sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the analogue gravity model within the context of f(R,T) gravity applied to graphene. The derivation of the Lagrangian density in two dimensions (2D) is undertaken, accounting for the altered gravitational effects as characterized by the function f(R,T). The Lagrangian encompasses the quasiparticle field $\psi(x)$, its adjoint $\overline{\psi}$, the effective metric tensor $g^{\mu\nu}$, and the gauge field $A_{\nu}$. The equations of motion are established through variational principles applied to the Lagrangian, resulting in modified Dirac equations. We discuss the interpretation of the additional terms in the equations of motion and their significance in capturing the modified gravitational dynamics in the graphene system. Our findings contribute to the understanding of analogue gravity models and their applications in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>First-Order Phase Transition of the Schwinger Model with a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the first-order phase transition in the lattice Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term by means of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Using two different fermion discretizations, Wilson and staggered fermions, we develop parametric ansatz circuits suitable for both discretizations, and compare their performance by simulating classically an ideal VQE optimization in the absence of noise. The states obtained by the classical simulation are then prepared on the IBM's superconducting quantum hardware. Applying state-of-the art error-mitigation methods, we show that the electric field density and particle number, observables which reveal the phase structure of the model, can be reliably obtained from the quantum hardware. To investigate the minimum system sizes required for a continuum extrapolation, we study the continuum limit using matrix product states, and compare our results to continuum mass perturbation theory. We demonstrate that taking the additive mass renormalization into account is vital for enhancing the precision that can be obtained with smaller system sizes. Furthermore, for the observables we investigate we observe universality, and both fermion discretizations produce the same continuum limit.</description>

      <title>New aspect of chiral and axial breaking in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry in QCD is stricter than the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, simply because of the presence of the quantum axial anomaly. If the QCD gauge coupling is sent to zero, the strength of the $U(1)$ axial breaking coincides with that of the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, which we shall in short call an axial-chiral coincidence. This coincidence is trivial since QCD then becomes a non-interacting theory. Actually, there exists another limit in the QCD parameter space, where an axial-chiral coincidence occurs even with nonzero QCD gauge coupling, that can be dubbed a nontrivial coincidence: it is the case with the massive light quarks $(m_l\neq 0)$ and the massless strange quark ($m_s=0$), due to the flavor-singlet nature of the topological susceptibility. This coincidence is robust and tied to the anomalous chiral Ward-Takahashi identity, which is operative even at hot QCD. This implies that the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry is restored simultaneously with the $U(1)$ axial symmetry at high temperatures. This simultaneous restoration is independent of $m_l (\neq 0)$, hence is irrespective to the order of the chiral phase transition. In this paper, we discuss how the real-life QCD can be evolved from the nontrivial chiral-axial coincidence limit, by working on a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with the $U(1)$ axial anomaly contribution properly incorporated. It is shown that at high temperatures the large differences between the restorations of the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry and the $U(1)$ axial symmetry for two light quarks and a sufficiently large current mass for the strange quark is induced by a significant interference of the topological susceptibility. Thus the deviation from the nontrivial coincidence, which is monitored by the strange quark mass controlling the topological susceptibility, provides a new way of understanding the chiral $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ axial breaking in QCD.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Transition Form Factors of Baryon Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical advancements have led to significant progress in our understanding of the electromagnetic structure of nucleons ($N$), nucleon excitations ($N^\ast$), and other baryons. These breakthroughs have been made possible by the capabilities of modern facilities, enabling the induction of photo- and electro-excitation of nucleon resonances. Recent experimental advances have sparked notable developments in theoretical approaches. New theoretical methods have been tested and proven to be robust, marking the beginning of a new era in our understanding on baryons. We present a comprehensive review of progress in experimental data on $\gamma^\ast N \to N^\ast$ reactions. Additionally, we discuss various analyses and theoretical results. Some of these methods have matured in their predictive power, offering new perspectives on exotic hadrons with multiquark components. We place special emphasis on both the low-$Q^2$ and large-$Q^2$ regions to reinforce crucial physical constraints on observables that hold in these limits. Furthermore, we illustrate that the combination of lattice QCD with chiral effective field theory and quark models, respectively, proves beneficial in interpreting data and applying constraints within those different regimes. As a practical contribution and for future reference, we review the formulas for helicity amplitudes, multipole form factors and the relations between these two sets of functions for transitions to resonances with general spin $J \geq \frac{1}{2}$. These formulas are ubiquitous and play a pivotal role in experimental and theoretical studies on baryon structure. Notably, the multipole transition form factors for $J \ge \frac{3}{2}$ resonances serve as valuable tools to test perturbative QCD results in the large-$Q^2$ region, thanks to the correlations between electric and magnetic transition form factors.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies as obstructions to gauging (non-on-site) symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. We consider anomalies in internal and lattice translation symmetries. We derive a microscopic formula for the "anomaly cocycle" using topological defects implementing twisted boundary conditions. The anomaly takes value in the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1)) \times H^2(G,U(1))$. The first factor captures the anomaly in the internal symmetry group $G$, and the second factor corresponds to a generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly involving $G$ and lattice translation. We present a systematic procedure to gauge internal symmetries (that may not act on-site) on the lattice. We show that the anomaly cocycle is the obstruction to gauging the internal symmetry while preserving the lattice translation symmetry. As an application, we construct anomaly-free chiral lattice gauge theories. We demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between (locality-preserving) symmetry operators and topological defects, which is essential for the results we prove. We also discuss the generalization to fermionic theories. Finally, we construct non-invertible lattice translation symmetries by gauging internal symmetries with a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly.</description>

      <title>The $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Green's functions $G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ and their self-consistent equations admit analytic continuations to complex $n$. The indeterminacy of bootstrap problems can be resolved by the principle of minimal singularity. We use the harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the bootstrap analysis, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we revisit the $\phi^n$ trajectories at non-integer $n$ by the standard wave function formulation. The results are in agreement with the minimally singular solutions. Using the matching procedure, we obtain accurate solutions for anharmonic oscillators with higher powers. In particular, the existence of $G_n$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant oscillators with non-integer powers.</description>
