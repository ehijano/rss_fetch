      <title>Impact of repetitive ELM transients on ITER monoblock top surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the high stored energy of ITER plasmas, the heat pulses due to uncontrolled Type I edge localized modes (ELMs) can be sufficient to melt the top surface of several poloidal rows of tungsten monoblocks in the divertor strike point regions. Coupled with the melt motion associated with tungsten in the strong tokamak magnetic fields, the resulting surface damage after even a comparatively small number of such repetitive transients may have a significant impact on long-term stationary power handling capability. The permissible numbers set important boundaries on operation and on the performance required from the plasma control system. Modelling is carried out with the recently updated MEMENTO melt dynamics code, which is tailored to tackle melt motion problems characterized by a vast spatio-temporal scale separation. The crucial role of coupling between surface deformation and shallow angle heat loading in aggravating melt damage is highlighted. As a consequence, the allowable operational space in terms of ELM-induced transient heat loads is history-dependent and once deformation has occurred, weaker heat loads, incapable of melting a pristine surface, can further extend the damage.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the $m=1$ rigid ballooning mode in a mirror trap with high-beta sloshing ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability of the ``rigid'' $m = 1$ ballooning mode in a mirror axisymmetric trap is studied for the case of oblique neutral beam injection (NBI), which creates an anisotropic population of fast sloshing ions. Since small-scale modes with azimuthal numbers $m&gt;1$ in long thin (paraxial) mirror traps are easily stabilized by finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects, suppression of the rigid ballooning and flute modes would mean stabilization of all MHD modes, with the exception of mirror and fire-hose disturbances, which are intensively studied in geophysics, but have not yet been identified in mirror traps.
  Large-scale ballooning mode can, in principle, be suppressed either by the lateral perfectly conducting wall, or by the end MHD anchors such as cusp, or by biased limiters, or by combination of these two methods. The effect of the wall shape, vacuum gap width between the plasma column and the lateral wall, angle of oblique NBI, radial profile of the plasma pressure, and axial profile of the vacuum magnetic field are studied.</description>

      <title>The coupling mechanism between crossed-beams energy transfer and stimulated Brillouin scattering in homogeneous plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling mechanism between crossed beams energy transfer and stimulated Brillouin scattering in homogeneous plasmas are studied by theoretical analysis, fluid simulations and particle in cell(PIC) simulations. The numerical models of laser plasma instabilities are constructed by solving coupling equations with Schodinger equations form, and the fluid simulation results are confirmed by fluid theory and PIC simulations.In the parameter regime when the pump depletion does not occur in CBET and the reflectivity of SBS is lower than 1%, SBS will be affected by CBET, the CBET energy gain will still agree with theoretical predications. However, In the parameter regime when the pump depletion does occur in CBET and the reflectivity of SBS is higher than 1%, the CBET spatial gain will be reduced by the interaction of CBET and SBS, and the huge difference of SBS reflectivity for two crossed laser beams is observed.In the PIC simulations, we found that lower ZTe=Ti will significantly reduce the interaction between CBET and SBS (Z is the ion charge, Teis the electron temperature, Ti is the ion temperature).</description>

      <title>Direct laser acceleration in varying plasma density profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct laser acceleration has proven to be an efficient source of high-charge electron bunches and high brilliance X-rays. However, an analytical description of the acceleration in the interaction with varying plasma density targets is still missing. Here, we provide an analytical estimate of the maximum energies that electrons can achieve in such a case. We demonstrate that the maximum energy depends on the local electron properties at the moment when the electron fulfills the resonant condition at the beginning of the acceleration. This knowledge enables density shaping for various purposes. One application is to decrease the required acceleration distance which has important implications for multi-petawatt laser experiments, where strong laser depletion could play a crucial role. Another use for density tailoring is to achieve acceleration beyond the radiation reaction limit. We derive the energy scaling law that is valid for arbitrary density profile that varies slowly compared with the betatron period. Our results can be applied to electron heating in exponential preplasma of thin foils, ablating plasma plumes, or gas jets with long-scale ramp-up.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Heating and Parallel Heat Flux in Electron-only Magnetic Reconnection with Intense Guide Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-only reconnection is a process recently observed in the Earth's magnetosheath, where magnetic reconnection occurs at electron kinetic scales with only electrons involved. Electron-only reconnection is likely to have a significant impact on the energy conversion and dissipation of turbulence cascades at kinetic scales. This paper investigates electron-only reconnection under different intensities of strong guide fields via two-dimensional fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, focusing on electron heating. The simulations are initialized with a force-free current sheet equilibrium under various intensities of strong guide fields. The quadrupolar structures of the out-of-plane magnetic field and asymmetric structures of density are found to become narrower in space as the guide field increases. Electron velocities are considerably larger than ion velocities, and the motion of both species is notably affected by the strength of guide fields. Similarly to previous experiments studies, electron temperature anisotropy along separatrices is observed, which is found to be mainly caused by the variations of parallel temperature. Both regions of anisotropy and parallel temperature increase/decrease along separatrices become thinner with increasing guide fields. Besides, we find a transition from a quadrupolar to a six-polar to an eight-polar structure in temperature anisotropy and parallel temperature as the guide field intensifies. Non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) at different locations in the three simulations are observed. Our results show that parallel electron velocity varies notably with different guide field intensities and strong parallel electron heat flux is observed.</description>

      <title>Collisional whistler instability and electron temperature staircase in inhomogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-beta magnetized plasmas often exhibit anomalously structured temperature profiles, as seen from galaxy cluster observations and recent experiments. It is well known that when such plasmas are collisionless, temperature gradients along the magnetic field can excite whistler waves that efficiently scatter electrons to limit their heat transport. Only recently has it been shown that parallel temperature gradients can excite whistler waves also in collisional plasmas. Here we develop a Wigner--Moyal theory for the collisional whistler instability starting from Braginskii-like fluid equations in a slab geometry. This formalism is necessary because, for a large region in parameter space, the fastest-growing whistler waves have wavelengths comparable to the background temperature gradients. We find additional damping terms in the expression for the instability growth rate involving inhomogeneous Nernst advection and resistivity. They (i) enable whistler waves to re-arrange the electron temperature profile via growth, propagation, and subsequent dissipation, and (ii) allow non-constant temperature profiles to exist stably. For high-beta plasmas, the marginally stable solutions take the form of a temperature staircase along the magnetic field lines. The electron heat flux can also be suppressed by the Ettingshausen effect when the whistler intensity profile is sufficiently peaked and oriented opposite the background temperature gradient. This mechanism allows cold fronts without magnetic draping, might reduce parallel heat losses in inertial fusion experiments, and generally demonstrates that whistler waves can regulate transport even in the collisional limit.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Space-Charge Field Screening of a Relativistic Particle Bunch in Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-charge field of a relativistic charged bunch propagating in plasma is screened due to the presence of mobile charge carriers. We experimentally investigate such screening by measuring the effect of dielectric wakefields driven by the bunch in a uncoated dielectric capillary where the plasma is confined. We show that the plasma screens the space-charge field and therefore suppresses the dielectric wakefields when the distance between the bunch and the dielectric surface is much larger than the plasma skin depth. Before full screening is reached, the effects of dielectric and plasma wakefields are present simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Anticathode effect on electron kinetics in electron beam generated $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron beam (e-beam) generated plasmas with applied crossed electric and magnetic $\left(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}\right)$ fields are promising for low damage processing of materials with applications to microelectronics and quantum information systems. In cylindrical e-beam $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ plasmas, radial confinement of electrons and ions is achieved by an axial magnetic field and radial electric field, respectively. To control the axial confinement of electrons, such e-beam generated plasma sources may incorporate a conducting boundary known as an anticathode, which is placed on the axially opposite side of the plasma from the cathode. In this work, it is shown that varying the anticathode voltage bias can control the degree to which the anticathode collects or repels incident electrons, allowing control of warm electron (electron energies in 10-30 eV range) and beam electron population confinement. It is suggested that the effect of the anticathode bias on the formation of these distinct electron populations is also associated with the transition between weak turbulence and strong Langmuir turbulence.</description>

      <title>Turbulent magnetic decay controlled by two conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of a turbulent magnetic field is slower with helicity than without. Furthermore, the magnetic correlation length grows faster for a helical than a nonhelical field. Both helical and nonhelical decay laws involve conserved quantities: the mean magnetic helicity density and the Hosking integral. Using direct numerical simulations, we show quantitatively that in the fractionally helical case the magnetic energy and correlation length are approximately given by the maximum of the values for the purely helical and purely nonhelical cases. The time of switch-over from one to the other decay law can be obtained on dimensional grounds and is approximately given by $I_\mathrm{H}^{1/2}I_\mathrm{M}^{-3/2}$, where $I_\mathrm{H}$ is the Hosking integral and $I_\mathrm{M}$ is the mean magnetic helicity density. An earlier approach based on the decay time is found to agree with our new result and suggests that the Hosking integral exceeds naive estimates by the square of the same resistivity-dependent factor by which the turbulent decay time exceeds the Alfv\'en time.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Third Harmonic of a Vacuum Response in a Subcritical Laser Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear response of the physical vacuum by the example of the third harmonic in radiation of the electron-positron-photon plasma excited by a strong time dependent electric field at the focus spot of counterpropagating laser pulses. The investigation was developed within the framework of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon kinetic theory nonperturbatively describing vacuum creation of the quasiparticle electron-positron plasma (EPP) and different channels of its interaction with the photon subsystem in the single-photon approximation that are opened in the presence of a strong semiclassical field. We investigate the radiation of EPP in the annihilation channel on the basis of the well known approximations and compare the obtained result with the semiclassical radiation of the plasma oscillations. In the high-frequency range for large adiabaticity parameter the quantum radiation dominates in comparison with the semiclassical one.</description>

      <title>Extended Cyclotron Resonant Heating of the Turbulent Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized, nearly parallel propagating waves are prevalent in the solar wind at ion-kinetic scales. At these scales, the spectrum of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind steepens, often called the transition-range, before flattening at sub-ion scales. Circularly polarized waves have been proposed as a mechanism to couple electromagnetic fluctuations to ion gyromotion, enabling ion-scale dissipation that results in observed ion-scale steepening. Here, we study Parker Solar Probe observations of an extended stream of fast solar wind ranging from 15-55 solar radii. We demonstrate that, throughout the stream, transition-range steepening at ion-scales is associated with the presence of significant left handed ion-kinetic scale waves, which are thought to be ion-cyclotron waves. We implement quasilinear theory to compute the rate at which ions are heated via cyclotron resonance with the observed circularly polarized waves given the empirically measured proton velocity distribution functions. We apply the Von Karman decay law to estimate the turbulent decay of the large-scale fluctuations, which is equal to the turbulent energy cascade rate. We find that the ion-cyclotron heating rates are correlated with, and amount to a significant fraction of, the turbulent energy cascade rate, implying that cyclotron heating is an important dissipation mechanism in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Temperature inversion in a non-homogeneous collisionless plasma with a thermal boundary: the temporal coarse-graining method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompted by the relevant problem of temperature inversion (i.e. gradient of density anti-correlated to the gradient of temperature) in astrophysics, we introduce a novel method to model a gravitationally confined multi-component collisionless plasma in contact with a fluctuating thermal boundary. We focus on systems with anti-correlated (inverted) density and temperature profiles, with applications to solar physics. The dynamics of the plasma is analytically described via the coupling of an appropriated coarse-grained distribution function and temporally coarse-grained Vlasov dynamics. We derive a stationary solution of the system and predict the inverted density and temperature profiles of the two-species for scenarios relevant for the corona. We validate our method by comparing the analytical results with kinetic numerical simulations of the plasma dynamics in the context of the two-species Hamiltonian mean-field model (HMF). Finally, we apply our theoretical framework to the problem of the temperature inversion in the solar corona obtaining density and temperature profiles in remarkably good agreement with the observations.</description>

      <title>Energy exchange between electrons and ions in ion temperature gradient turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microturbulence in magnetic confined plasmas contributes to energy exchange between particles of different species as well as the particle and heat fluxes. Although the effect of turbulent energy exchange has not been considered significant in previous studies, it is anticipated to have a greater impact than collisional energy exchange in low collisional plasmas such as those in future fusion reactors. In this study, gyrokinetic simulations are performed to evaluate the energy exchange in ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence. The energy exchange due to the ITG turbulence mainly consists of the cooling of ions in the $\nabla B$-curvature drift motion and the heating of electrons streaming along a field line. It is found that the ITG turbulence transfers energy from ions to electrons regardless of whether the ions or electrons are hotter, which is in marked contrast to the energy transfer by Coulomb collisions. This implies that the ITG turbulence should be suppressed from the viewpoint of sustaining the high ion temperature required for fusion reactions since it prevents energy transfer from alpha-heated electrons to ions as well as enhancing ion heat transport toward the outside of the reactor. Furthermore, linear and nonlinear simulation analyses confirm the feasibility of quasilinear modeling for predicting the turbulent energy exchange in addition to the particle and heat fluxes.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the type-III radiation observed near the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textit{AIMS.}$ (1) To use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data to test the accepted theory that type-III radiation is produced by counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the electromagnetic wave at twice the Langmuir frequency. (2) To use the new data obtained from the PSP to improve or modify the model of type-III wave generation.
  $\textit{METHODS.}$ To obtain new properties of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics, their phase velocities and density fluctuations were measured. If the harmonic wave was electromagnetic, as in the accepted theory, these quantities would not be measurable. However, in an electrostatic wave, they would be measurable by the PSP instruments.
  $\textit{RESULTS.}$ The Langmuir wave and its harmonics at frequencies of $n\omega_p$, where $\omega_p = 2\pi\times125$ kHz is the Langmuir frequency and $n \in \{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$, were measured in an active type-III event. The lowest harmonics contained density fluctuations, so they were electrostatic waves and not type-III emissions. This result was bolstered by measuring their very slow phase velocities ($&lt; 20,000$ km/sec) which are not those of a type-III wave. Thus, the harmonic waves were not a result of the three-wave interaction (as required by the accepted theory) but they were electrostatic antenna waves produced by radiation of the Langmuir wave. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation. It is also found that there is no evidence for or against the conventional model for generation of the type-III emissions.</description>

      <title>Whistler waves in the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Earth's magnetosheath (MSH), several processes contribute to energy dissipation and plasma heating, one of which is wave-particle interactions between whistler waves and electrons. However, the overall impact of whistlers on electron dynamics in the MSH remains to be quantified. We analyze 18 hours of burst-mode measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, including data from the unbiased magnetosheath campaign during February-March 2023. We present a statistical study of 34,409 whistler waves found using automatic detection. We compare wave occurrence in the different MSH geometries and find three times higher occurrence in the quasi-perpendicular MSH compared to the quasi-parallel case. We also study the wave properties and find that the waves propagate quasi-parallel to the background magnetic field, have a median frequency of 0.2 times the electron cyclotron frequency, median amplitude of 0.03-0.06 nT (30-60 pT), and median duration of a few tens of wave periods. The whistler waves are preferentially observed in local magnetic dips and density peaks and are not associated with an increased temperature anisotropy. Also, almost no whistlers are observed in regions with parallel electron plasma beta lower than 0.1. Importantly, when estimating pitch-angle diffusion times we find that the whistler waves cause significant pitch-angle scattering of electrons in the MSH.</description>
