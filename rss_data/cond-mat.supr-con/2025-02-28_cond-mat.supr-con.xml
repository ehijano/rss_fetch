      <title>Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We find that the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic, has a spin-texture with an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy that is revealed in measurements of the in-plane critical field in the superconducting state, as well as from quantum corrections to the magnetoresistance in the normal state. This spin texture is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic overlayers provide a unique probe of spin textures and related phenomena in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>First-principles study on Pr-doped Bilayer Nickelate La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Pr-doped Ruddlesden-Popper phase of bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been reported to exhibit a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 82.5 K and superconducting volume fraction of about 57 % at high pressure. However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</description>

      <title>Extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated layered superconductors using an extended 2D Tinkham model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk two dimensional (2D) superconductivity has gained considerable attention due to its intricate interplay between symmetry breaking, nontrivial topology, 2D phase fluctuations, and unconventional superconductivity. However, certain intercalated layered superconductors, despite their short c-axis superconducting coherence length, have been misclassified as anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) superconductors. Here, we investigate (Li,Fe)OHFeSe superconductors with varying degrees of interlayer misalignment, revealing sample-dependent superconducting dimensionality while consistently observing Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transitions. To resolve this discrepancy, we develop an extended 2D Tinkham model that quantitatively captures the blurring effects induced by interlayer misalignment. We further demonstrate the validity of this model in both (Li,Fe)OHFeSe and cetyltrimethyl ammonium (CTA+) intercalated (CTA)0.5SnSe2 superconductors, highlighting its broad applicability. This work provides valuable insights into bulk 2D superconductivity and establishes an extended 2D Tinkham model for quantitatively extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated layered superconductors, particularly those exhibiting significant interlayer misalignments.</description>

      <title>Phonon anomalies within the polar charge density wave phase of superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to study the lattice dynamics of the polar charge density wave phase of the superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality. We show the phononic signatures of the charge density wave transition at $T^*$=155K in Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. The detailed temperature dependence of these phonon modes' frequency, half-width-at-half-maximum, and the integrated area below $T^*$ reveal anomalies at an intermediate temperature $T'\sim$100K, especially for the low-energy modes at 130cm$^{-1}$ and 180cm$^{-1}$. Since these low-energy modes are dominated by Mo-related lattice vibration, we propose that lattice anomalies at $T'$ within the charge density wave phase are related to a modification of the Mo displacements while preserving the crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Robust $s_\pm$-wave pairing in a bilayer two-orbital model of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ without the $\gamma$ Fermi surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the superconducting pairing symmetry based on a newly constructed tight-binding model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, where the $\gamma$ band sinks below the Fermi level and does not form the Fermi surface. The superconducting pairing symmetry is $s_\pm$-wave and is robust against the variation of the interaction strength. In this model, although the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are away from the Fermi level, the superconducting pairing function on them is not tiny. Instead, since the top of the $\gamma$ band and bottom of the $\delta$ band are both located at $\sim$500 meV away from the Fermi level, and they are almost nested by the peak structure in the spin fluctuation, thus by forming an anti-phase pairing function on them, these two bands act constructively to superconductivity. Finally with detailed derivation and numerical calculation, we demonstrate that the Fermi surface approximated Eliashberg equation may lead to deviation of the pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Detecting Topological Phase Transition in Superconductor-Semiconductor Hybrids by Electronic Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, applying a magnetic field closes a trivial bulk gap and causes a topological phase transition (TPT), resulting in the emergence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of the wires. However, trivial Andreev bound states formed at the interface with metallic leads mimic the local Majorana properties, making it difficult to detect the TPT through local conductance measurements. In this work, we investigate the detection of the bulk TPT by exploiting the static and dynamic density response of the hybrid system. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamical renormalized responses reveal the characteristic electronic structure and detect the TPT, which we then show to produce strong intensities of Raman scattering. Furthermore, we find that gapless plasmons emerge in the normal state, signaling the bulk Lifshitz transition. Our results thus predict that the bulk response of superconducting nanowires is a powerful spectroscopic approach to detect the bulk topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in superconductors with chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological transitions in one dimensional superconductors that can harbor multiple edge Majorana bound states protected by chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry arises due to the structure of the internal spin degrees of freedom of the superconductor and it can be guided by the coupling of the superconductor with sources of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then consider distinct regions of the phase diagram in the parameters space that are marked by gapless excitations in the spectrum and evaluate the conditions for inducing a topological transition. We show that for gapless chiral symmetric superconductors one can identify a class of physical perturbations that enable a gap opening in the spectrum, without breaking chirality, and turn the system into a topological state. This type of superconductor is dubbed marginal topological superconductor because an infinitesimally small perturbation is able to induce a transition into a topological nontrivial phase. To explicitly demonstrate and evaluate the character of the transitions from gapless to topological gapfull phases we explore different physical cases including $p$-wave superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field or proximity-coupled to a ferromagnet, and $s$-wave superconductor in a noncollinear magnetic ordering.</description>

      <title>Search for magnetic field expulsion in optically driven K$_3$C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoexcited K$_3$C$_{60}$ displays several properties reminiscent of equilibrium superconductivity, including transient optical spectra, pressure dependence, and I-V characteristics. However, these observations do not decisively establish non-equilibrium superconductivity, which would be conclusively evidenced by transient Meissner diamagnetism, as shown recently in driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$. Here, we search for transient magnetic field expulsion in K$_3$C$_{60}$ by measuring Faraday rotation in a magneto-optic material placed in its vicinity. Unlike in the case of homogeneous, insulating YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$, inhomogeneous, metallic K$_3$C$_{60}$ powders reduce the size of the effect. With the $\sim50$ nT magnetic field resolution achieved in our experiments, we provide an upper limit for the photo-induced diamagnetic volume susceptibility ($\chi_v&gt;-0.1$). On this basis, we conclude that the photo-induced phase has weaker diamagnetism than superconducting K$_3$C$_{60}$ at zero temperature. Yet, from recent nonlinear transport measurements in this granular material, we expect a light-induced state similar to the equilibrium superconductor near 0.8 T$_c$, for which $\chi_v&gt;-0.1$. A definitive conclusion on the presence or absence of Meissner diamagnetism cannot be made for K$_3$C$_{60}$ with the current resolution.</description>

      <title>Topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the $d_{xy}$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle $\theta$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally. Overall, this work establishes altermagnets as a versatile paradigm for realizing topological superconductivity, bridging conceptual innovations with scalable quantum architectures devoid of orbital effects and stray fields.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Comment on "InAs-Al hybrid devices passing the topological gap protocol", Microsoft Quantum, Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological gap protocol (TGP) is presented as "a series of stringent experimental tests" for the presence of topological superconductivity and associated Majorana bound states. Here, we show that the TGP, 'passed' by Microsoft Quantum [PRB 107, 245423 (2023)], lacks a consistent definition of 'gap' or 'topological', and even utilises different parameters when applied to theoretical simulations compared to experimental data. Furthermore, the TGP's outcome is sensitive to the choice of magnetic field range, bias voltage range, data resolution, and number of cutter voltage pairs - data parameters that, in PRB 107, 245423 (2023), vary significantly, even for measurements of the same device. As a result, the core claims of PRB 107, 245423 (2023) are primarily based on unexplained measurement choices and inconsistent definitions, rather than on intrinsic properties of the studied devices. As such, Microsoft Quantum's claim in PRB 107, 245423 (2023) that their devices have a "high probability of being in the topological phase" is not reliable and must be revisited. Our findings also suggest that subsequent studies, e.g. Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), that are based on tuning up devices via the TGP are built on a flawed protocol and should also be revisited.</description>

      <title>Impurity States in Altermagnetic Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose non-magnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether the impurity respects the bulk symmetries or not, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the N\'eel vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling a new approach for in-situ control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements like scanning tunneling microscopy and open new avenues for designing tunable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Friedel oscillations and chiral superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign, a key to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two degenerate solutions at the critical temperature Tc, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below Tc is in excellent agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Andreev non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for open Josephson junctions from Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of open Josephson junctions (JJs) through a minimal effective non-Hermitian (NH) approach derived from the equilibrium Green's function (GF) formalism. Specifically, we consider a JJ with a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling introduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be naturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar problems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for deriving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we compute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of applicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot density of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in different transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH description is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound states (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS energies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their line-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but also offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a superconductor electrons form pairs despite the Coulomb repulsion as a result of an effective attractive interaction mediated by, for example phonons. In the present paper DeGennes' description of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction is adopted for the effective interaction. This model is generalized by including the elastic response of the charge-compensating background and the BCS gap equation is solved for the resulting effective electron-electron interaction. It is demonstrated that the superconducting critical temperature becomes strongly enhanced when the material is tuned close to a structural instability.</description>

      <title>Non Linear Hall Effects induced by Berry Curvature Dipole in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure featuring flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and a refined tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations reveal that LK-99 hosts Weyl points near the Fermi level, which contribute significantly to Berry curvature. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further splits these bands, generating additional Weyl points and enhancing the Berry curvature distribution. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Emulating Novel Topological Phases with Ultracold Fermions in Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a feasible scheme utilizing the Floquet engineering platform with ultracold atoms in optical lattices to emulate both pair-hopping processes and singlet/triplet pairing interactions, aiming to simulate and control novel topologically nontrivial phases. Our large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal three distinct topological regimes: (i) a Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase characterized by exponentially localized edge charges, non-local single-fermion edge correlations, a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum; (ii) a $z$-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase manifesting fractionalized edge spin; and (iii) a novel x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase exhibiting fractional edge spins along the $x$-direction and non-local single-particle edge correlations, merging characteristics of the edge states from both MS and TS phases. Therefore, our work establishes a versatile framework for exploring exotic quantum phases and non-Abelian edge states in number-conserving systems.</description>
