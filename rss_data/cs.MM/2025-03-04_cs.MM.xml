      <title>Perceptual Visual Quality Assessment: Principles, Methods, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multimedia services such as video streaming, video conferencing, virtual reality (VR), and online gaming continue to expand, ensuring high perceptual visual quality becomes a priority to maintain user satisfaction and competitiveness. However, multimedia content undergoes various distortions during acquisition, compression, transmission, and storage, resulting in the degradation of experienced quality. Thus, perceptual visual quality assessment (PVQA), which focuses on evaluating the quality of multimedia content based on human perception, is essential for optimizing user experiences in advanced communication systems. Several challenges are involved in the PVQA process, including diverse characteristics of multimedia content such as image, video, VR, point cloud, mesh, multimodality, etc., and complex distortion scenarios as well as viewing conditions. In this paper, we first present an overview of PVQA principles and methods. This includes both subjective methods, where users directly rate their experiences, and objective methods, where algorithms predict human perception based on measurable factors such as bitrate, frame rate, and compression levels. Based on the basics of PVQA, quality predictors for different multimedia data are then introduced. In addition to traditional images and videos, immersive multimedia and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) content are also discussed. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions of PVQA research.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution Encoding for HTTP Adaptive Streaming using VVenC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is a widely adopted method for delivering video content over the Internet, requiring each video to be encoded at multiple bitrates and resolution pairs, known as representations, to adapt to various network conditions and device capabilities. This multi-bitrate encoding introduces significant challenges due to the computational and time-intensive nature of encoding multiple representations. Conventional approaches often encode these videos independently without leveraging similarities between different representations of the same input video. This paper proposes an accelerated multi-resolution encoding strategy that utilizes representations of lower resolutions as references to speed up the encoding of higher resolutions when using Versatile Video Coding (VVC); specifically in VVenC, an optimized open-source software implementation. For multi-resolution encoding, a mid-bitrate representation serves as the reference, allowing interpolated encoded partition data to efficiently guide the partitioning process in higher resolutions. The proposed approach uses shared encoding information to reduce redundant calculations, optimizing partitioning decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves a reduction of up to 17% compared to medium preset in encoding time across videos of varying complexities with minimal BDBR/BDT of 0.12 compared to the fast preset.</description>

      <title>Improving the Efficiency of VVC using Partitioning of Reference Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the growing demand for high-quality videos, Versatile Video Coding (VVC) was released in 2020, building on the hybrid coding architecture of its predecessor, HEVC, achieving about 50% bitrate reduction for the same visual quality. It introduces more flexible block partitioning, enhancing compression efficiency at the cost of increased encoding complexity. To make efficient use of VVC in practical applications, optimization is essential. VVenC, an optimized open-source VVC encoder, introduces multiple presets to address the trade-off between compression efficiency and encoder complexity. Although an optimized set of encoding tools has been selected for each preset, the rate-distortion (RD) search space in the encoder presets still poses a challenge for efficient encoder implementations. In this paper, we propose Early Termination using Reference Frames (ETRF), which improves the trade-off between encoding efficiency and time complexity and positions itself as a new preset between medium and fast presets. The CTU partitioning map of the reference frames in lower temporal layers is employed to accelerate the encoding of frames in higher temporal layers. The results show a reduction in the encoding time of around 21% compared to the medium preset. Specifically, for videos with high spatial and temporal complexities, which typically require longer encoding times, the proposed method achieves a better trade-off between bitrate savings and encoding time compared to the fast preset.</description>

      <title>I see what you mean: Co-Speech Gestures for Reference Resolution in Multimodal Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In face-to-face interaction, we use multiple modalities, including speech and gestures, to communicate information and resolve references to objects. However, how representational co-speech gestures refer to objects remains understudied from a computational perspective. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal reference resolution task centred on representational gestures, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of learning robust gesture embeddings. We propose a self-supervised pre-training approach to gesture representation learning that grounds body movements in spoken language. Our experiments show that the learned embeddings align with expert annotations and have significant predictive power. Moreover, reference resolution accuracy further improves when (1) using multimodal gesture representations, even when speech is unavailable at inference time, and (2) leveraging dialogue history. Overall, our findings highlight the complementary roles of gesture and speech in reference resolution, offering a step towards more naturalistic models of human-machine interaction.</description>

      <title>PodAgent: A Comprehensive Framework for Podcast Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Existing automatic audio generation methods struggle to generate podcast-like audio programs effectively. The key challenges lie in in-depth content generation, appropriate and expressive voice production. This paper proposed PodAgent, a comprehensive framework for creating audio programs. PodAgent 1) generates informative topic-discussion content by designing a Host-Guest-Writer multi-agent collaboration system, 2) builds a voice pool for suitable voice-role matching and 3) utilizes LLM-enhanced speech synthesis method to generate expressive conversational speech. Given the absence of standardized evaluation criteria for podcast-like audio generation, we developed comprehensive assessment guidelines to effectively evaluate the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate PodAgent's effectiveness, significantly surpassing direct GPT-4 generation in topic-discussion dialogue content, achieving an 87.4% voice-matching accuracy, and producing more expressive speech through LLM-guided synthesis.

      <title>Unbiased Video Scene Graph Generation via Visual and Semantic Dual Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to capture dynamic relationships among entities by sequentially analyzing video frames and integrating visual and semantic information. However, VidSGG is challenged by significant biases that skew predictions. To mitigate these biases, we propose a VIsual and Semantic Awareness (VISA) framework for unbiased VidSGG. VISA addresses visual bias through memory-enhanced temporal integration that enhances object representations and concurrently reduces semantic bias by iteratively integrating object features with comprehensive semantic information derived from triplet relationships. This visual-semantics dual debiasing approach results in more unbiased representations of complex scene dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where VISA outperforms existing unbiased VidSGG approaches by a substantial margin (e.g., +13.1% improvement in mR@20 and mR@50 for the SGCLS task under Semi Constraint).</description>

      <title>HOP: Heterogeneous Topology-based Multimodal Entanglement for Co-Speech Gesture Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-speech gestures are crucial non-verbal cues that enhance speech clarity and expressiveness in human communication, which have attracted increasing attention in multimodal research. While the existing methods have made strides in gesture accuracy, challenges remain in generating diverse and coherent gestures, as most approaches assume independence among multimodal inputs and lack explicit modeling of their interactions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning method named HOP for co-speech gesture generation that captures the heterogeneous entanglement between gesture motion, audio rhythm, and text semantics, enabling the generation of coordinated gestures. By leveraging spatiotemporal graph modeling, we achieve the alignment of audio and action. Moreover, to enhance modality coherence, we build the audio-text semantic representation based on a reprogramming module, which is beneficial for cross-modality adaptation. Our approach enables the trimodal system to learn each other's features and represent them in the form of topological entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HOP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering more natural and expressive co-speech gesture generation.

      <title>Streaming Piano Transcription Based on Consistent Onset and Offset Decoding with Sustain Pedal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a streaming audio-to-MIDI piano transcription approach that aims to sequentially translate a music signal into a sequence of note onset and offset events. The sequence-to-sequence nature of this task may call for the computationally-intensive transformer model for better performance, which has recently been used for offline transcription benchmarks and could be extended for streaming transcription with causal attention mechanisms. We assume that the performance limitation of this naive approach lies in the decoder. Although time-frequency features useful for onset detection are considerably different from those for offset detection, the single decoder is trained to output a mixed sequence of onset and offset events without guarantee of the correspondence between the onset and offset events of the same note. To overcome this limitation, we propose a streaming encoder-decoder model that uses a convolutional encoder aggregating local acoustic features, followed by an autoregressive Transformer decoder detecting a variable number of onset events and another decoder detecting the offset events for the active pitches with validation of the sustain pedal at each time frame. Experiments using the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed streaming method performed comparably with or even better than the state-of-the-art offline methods while significantly reducing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Kiss3DGen: Repurposing Image Diffusion Models for 3D Asset Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved great success in generating 2D images. However, the quality and generalizability of 3D content generation remain limited. State-of-the-art methods often require large-scale 3D assets for training, which are challenging to collect. In this work, we introduce Kiss3DGen (Keep It Simple and Straightforward in 3D Generation), an efficient framework for generating, editing, and enhancing 3D objects by repurposing a well-trained 2D image diffusion model for 3D generation. Specifically, we fine-tune a diffusion model to generate ''3D Bundle Image'', a tiled representation composed of multi-view images and their corresponding normal maps. The normal maps are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh, and the multi-view images provide texture mapping, resulting in a complete 3D model. This simple method effectively transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task, maximizing the utilization of knowledge in pretrained diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Kiss3DGen model is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as 3D editing, mesh and texture enhancement, etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce high-quality 3D models efficiently.</description>

      <title>CorrNetDroid: Android Malware Detector leveraging a Correlation-based Feature Selection for Network Traffic features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copious mobile operating systems exist in the market, but Android remains the user's choice. Meanwhile, its growing popularity has also attracted malware developers. Researchers have proposed various static solutions for Android malware detection. However, stealthier malware evade static analysis. This raises the need for a robust Android malware detection system capable of dealing with advanced threats and overcoming the shortcomings of static analysis.
  Hence, this work proposes a dynamic analysis-based Android malware detection system, CorrNetDroid, that works over network traffic flows. Many traffic features exhibit overlapping ranges in normal and malware datasets. Therefore, we first rank the features using two statistical measures, crRelevance and Normalized Mean Residue Similarity (NMRS), to assess feature-class and feature-feature correlations. Thereafter, we introduce a novel correlation-based feature selection algorithm that applies NMRS on crRelevance rankings to identify the optimal feature subset for Android malware detection.
  Experimental results highlight that our model effectively reduces the feature set while detecting Android malware with 99.50 percent accuracy when considering only two network traffic features. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the NMRS-based algorithm on crRelevance rankings outperforms statistical tests such as chi-square, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. In addition, our model surpasses various state-of-the-art Android malware detection techniques in terms of detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal task, termed audio-visual instance segmentation (AVIS), which aims to simultaneously identify, segment and track individual sounding object instances in audible videos. To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models. Unfortunately, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding. Dataset and code is available at https://github.com/ruohaoguo/avis.</description>

      <title>Video-Foley: Two-Stage Video-To-Sound Generation via Temporal Event Condition For Foley Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor alignment and controllability, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope closely related to audio semantics, acts as a temporal event feature to guide audio generation from video. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Source code, model weights and demos are available on our companion website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)</description>

      <title>FoodMLLM-JP: Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models for Japanese Recipe Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on food image understanding using recipe data has been a long-standing focus due to the diversity and complexity of the data. Moreover, food is inextricably linked to people's lives, making it a vital research area for practical applications such as dietary management. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, not only in their vast knowledge but also in their ability to handle languages naturally. While English is predominantly used, they can also support multiple languages including Japanese. This suggests that MLLMs are expected to significantly improve performance in food image understanding tasks. We fine-tuned open MLLMs LLaVA-1.5 and Phi-3 Vision on a Japanese recipe dataset and benchmarked their performance against the closed model GPT-4o. We then evaluated the content of generated recipes, including ingredients and cooking procedures, using 5,000 evaluation samples that comprehensively cover Japanese food culture. Our evaluation demonstrates that the open models trained on recipe data outperform GPT-4o, the current state-of-the-art model, in ingredient generation. Our model achieved F1 score of 0.531, surpassing GPT-4o's F1 score of 0.481, indicating a higher level of accuracy. Furthermore, our model exhibited comparable performance to GPT-4o in generating cooking procedure text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL), a special decentralized machine learning paradigm, has recently gained significant attention. OSFL requires only a single round of client data or model upload, which reduces communication costs and mitigates privacy threats compared to traditional FL. Despite these promising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data heterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL systems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on large-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these issues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results in significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance degradation in classification models trained on such data. This issue is particularly pronounced in rare domains, such as medical imaging, which are underrepresented in LDM's pretraining data. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the pretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP synthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without compromising the privacy regulations. FedBiP is also the first approach to simultaneously address feature space heterogeneity and client data scarcity in OSFL. Our method is validated through extensive experiments on three OSFL benchmarks with feature space heterogeneity, as well as on challenging medical and satellite image datasets with label heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiP, which substantially outperforms other OSFL methods.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has enabled them to generate unprecedented results from given texts. However, as text inputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and aligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding method for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization method for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts are divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method overcomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For preference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to fine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference models for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that the preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant part that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other visual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the text-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns different weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and enhancing alignment. After fine-tuning $512 \times 512$ Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 for about 20 hours using our method, the fine-tuned SD outperforms stronger foundation models in T2I alignment, such as PixArt-$\alpha$ and Kandinsky v2.2.
