      <title>No Algorithmic Collusion in Two-Player Blindfolded Game with Thompson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two players are engaged in a repeated game with unknown payoff matrices, they may be completely unaware of the existence of each other and use multi-armed bandit algorithms to choose the actions, which is referred to as the ``blindfolded game'' in this paper. We show that when the players use Thompson sampling, the game dynamics converges to the Nash equilibrium under a mild assumption on the payoff matrices. Therefore, algorithmic collusion doesn't arise in this case despite the fact that the players do not intentionally deploy competitive strategies. To prove the convergence result, we find that the framework developed in stochastic approximation doesn't apply, because of the sporadic and infrequent updates of the inferior actions and the lack of Lipschitz continuity. We develop a novel sample-path-wise approach to show the convergence.</description>

      <title>Bias Detection Via Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of detecting whether an agent is updating their prior beliefs given new evidence in an optimal way that is Bayesian, or whether they are biased towards their own prior. In our model, biased agents form posterior beliefs that are a convex combination of their prior and the Bayesian posterior, where the more biased an agent is, the closer their posterior is to the prior. Since we often cannot observe the agent's beliefs directly, we take an approach inspired by information design. Specifically, we measure an agent's bias by designing a signaling scheme and observing the actions they take in response to different signals, assuming that they are maximizing their own expected utility; our goal is to detect bias with a minimum number of signals. Our main results include a characterization of scenarios where a single signal suffices and a computationally efficient algorithm to compute optimal signaling schemes.</description>

      <title>Learning Social Welfare Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is it possible to understand or imitate a policy maker's rationale by looking at past decisions they made? We formalize this question as the problem of learning social welfare functions belonging to the well-studied family of power mean functions. We focus on two learning tasks; in the first, the input is vectors of utilities of an action (decision or policy) for individuals in a group and their associated social welfare as judged by a policy maker, whereas in the second, the input is pairwise comparisons between the welfares associated with a given pair of utility vectors. We show that power mean functions are learnable with polynomial sample complexity in both cases, even if the comparisons are social welfare information is noisy. Finally, we design practical algorithms for these tasks and evaluate their performance.</description>

      <title>Expectation in Stochastic Window Mean-Payoff Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic two-player games model systems with an environment that is both adversarial and stochastic. In this paper, we study the expected value of the window mean-payoff measure in stochastic games. The window mean-payoff measure strengthens the classical mean-payoff measure by measuring the mean-payoff over a window of bounded length that slides along an infinite path. Two variants have been considered: in one variant, the maximum window length is fixed and given, while in the other, it is not fixed but is required to be bounded. For both variants, we show that the decision problem to check if the expected value is at least a given threshold is in NP $\cap$ coNP. The result follows from guessing the expected values of the vertices, partitioning them into so-called value classes, and proving that a short certificate for the expected values exists. Finally, we also show that the memory required by the players to play optimally is no more than that in non-stochastic two-player games with the corresponding window objectives.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Computing in a Network of Data Centers: A Hierarchical Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the continuous surge in cloud computing demand has intensified data center workloads, leading to significant carbon emissions and driving the need for improving their efficiency and sustainability. This paper focuses on the optimal allocation problem of batch compute loads with temporal and spatial flexibility across a global network of data centers. We propose a bilevel game-theoretic solution approach that captures the inherent hierarchical relationship between supervisory control objectives, such as carbon reduction and peak shaving, and operational objectives, such as priority-aware scheduling. Numerical simulations with real carbon intensity data demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully reduces carbon emissions while simultaneously ensuring operational reliability and priority-aware scheduling.</description>

      <title>Apportionment with Weighted Seats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apportionment is the task of assigning resources to entities with different entitlements in a fair manner, and specifically a manner that is as proportional as possible. The best-known application concerns the assignment of parliamentary seats to political parties based on their share in the popular vote. Here we enrich the standard model of apportionment by associating each seat with a weight that reflects the value of that seat, for example because seats come with different roles, such as chair or treasurer, that have different (objective) values. We define several apportionment methods and natural fairness requirements for this new setting, and study the extent to which our methods satisfy our requirements. Our findings show that full fairness is harder to achieve than in the standard apportionment setting. At the same time, for relaxations of those requirements we can achieve stronger results than in the more general model of weighted fair division, where the values of objects are subjective.</description>

      <title>Feature-Based Online Bilateral Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilateral trade models the problem of facilitating trades between a seller and a buyer having private valuations for the item being sold. In the online version of the problem, the learner faces a new seller and buyer at each time step, and has to post a price for each of the two parties without any knowledge of their valuations. We consider a scenario where, at each time step, before posting prices the learner observes a context vector containing information about the features of the item for sale. The valuations of both the seller and the buyer follow an unknown linear function of the context. In this setting, the learner could leverage previous transactions in an attempt to estimate private valuations. We characterize the regret regimes of different settings, taking as a baseline the best context-dependent prices in hindsight. First, in the setting in which the learner has two-bit feedback and strong budget balance constraints, we propose an algorithm with $O(\log T)$ regret. Then, we study the same set-up with noisy valuations, providing a tight $\widetilde O(T^{\frac23})$ regret upper bound. Finally, we show that loosening budget balance constraints allows the learner to operate under more restrictive feedback. Specifically, we show how to address the one-bit, global budget balance setting through a reduction from the two-bit, strong budget balance setup. This established a fundamental trade-off between the quality of the feedback and the strictness of the budget constraints.</description>

      <title>Truthful Dataset Valuation by Pointwise Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common way to evaluate a dataset in ML involves training a model on this dataset and assessing the model's performance on a test set. However, this approach has two issues: (1) it may incentivize undesirable data manipulation in data marketplaces, as the self-interested data providers seek to modify the dataset to maximize their evaluation scores; (2) it may select datasets that overfit to potentially small test sets. We propose a new data valuation method that provably guarantees the following: data providers always maximize their expected score by truthfully reporting their observed data. Any manipulation of the data, including but not limited to data duplication, adding random data, data removal, or re-weighting data from different groups, cannot increase their expected score. Our method, following the paradigm of proper scoring rules, measures the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of the test dataset and the evaluated dataset. However, computing the PMI of two datasets is challenging. We introduce a novel PMI measuring method that greatly improves tractability within Bayesian machine learning contexts. This is accomplished through a new characterization of PMI that relies solely on the posterior probabilities of the model parameter at an arbitrarily selected value. Finally, we support our theoretical results with simulations and further test the effectiveness of our data valuation method in identifying the top datasets among multiple data providers. Interestingly, our method outperforms the standard approach of selecting datasets based on the trained model's test performance, suggesting that our truthful valuation score can also be more robust to overfitting.</description>

      <title>Metric distortion Under Probabilistic Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric distortion in social choice provides a framework for assessing how well voting rules minimize social cost in scenarios where voters and candidates exist in a shared metric space, with voters submitting rankings and the rule outputting a single winner. We expand this framework to include probabilistic voting. Our extension encompasses a broad range of probability functions, including widely studied models like Plackett-Luce (PL) and Bradley-Terry, and a novel "pairwise quantal voting" model inspired by quantal response theory.
  We demonstrate that distortion results under probabilistic voting better correspond with conventional intuitions regarding popular voting rules such as Plurality, Copeland, and Random Dictator (RD) than those under deterministic voting. For example, in the PL model with candidate strength inversely proportional to the square of their metric distance, we show that Copeland's distortion is at most 2, whereas that of RD is $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ in large elections, where $m$ is the number of candidates. This contrasts sharply with the classical model, where RD beats Copeland with a distortion of 3 versus 5 [1].</description>

      <title>Game Theory in Distributed Systems Security: Foundations, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many of our critical infrastructure systems and personal computing systems have a distributed computing systems structure. The incentives to attack them have been growing rapidly as has their attack surface due to increasing levels of connectedness. Therefore, we feel it is time to bring in rigorous reasoning to secure such systems. The distributed system security and the game theory technical communities can come together to effectively address this challenge. In this article, we lay out the foundations from each that we can build upon to achieve our goals. Next, we describe a set of research challenges for the community, organized into three categories -- analytical, systems, and integration challenges, each with "short term" time horizon (2-3 years) and "long term" (5-10 years) items. This article was conceived of through a community discussion at the 2022 NSF SaTC PI meeting.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Informative Text Evaluations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media.
  We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</description>

      <title>STRIDE: A Tool-Assisted LLM Agent Framework for Strategic and Interactive Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized natural language processing, showing remarkable linguistic proficiency and reasoning capabilities. However, their application in strategic multi-agent decision-making environments is hampered by significant limitations including poor mathematical reasoning, difficulty in following instructions, and a tendency to generate incorrect information. These deficiencies hinder their performance in strategic and interactive tasks that demand adherence to nuanced game rules, long-term planning, exploration in unknown environments, and anticipation of opponents' moves. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a novel LLM agent framework equipped with memory and specialized tools to enhance their strategic decision-making capabilities. We deploy the tools in a number of economically important environments, in particular bilateral bargaining and multi-agent and dynamic mechanism design. We employ quantitative metrics to assess the framework's performance in various strategic decision-making problems. Our findings establish that our enhanced framework significantly improves the strategic decision-making capability of LLMs. While we highlight the inherent limitations of current LLM models, we demonstrate the improvements through targeted enhancements, suggesting a promising direction for future developments in LLM applications for interactive environments.</description>
