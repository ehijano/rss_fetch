      <title>RNA-binding antiterminators: regulation of metabolism and pathogenicity in bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiterminators are essential components of bacterial transcriptional regulation, allowing the control of gene expression in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Among them, RNA-binding antiterminator proteins play a major role in preventing transcription termination by binding to specific RNA sequences. These RNA-binding antiterminators have been extensively studied for their role in regulating various metabolic pathways. However, their function in modulating the physiology of pathogens requires further investigation. This review focuses on RNA-binding proteins displaying CAT (Co-AntiTerminator) or ANTAR (AmiR and NasR Transcription Antitermination Regulators) domains reported in model bacteria. In particular, their structures, mechanism of action, and target genes will be described. The involvement of the antitermination mechanisms in bacterial pathogenicity is also discussed. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control bacterial virulence, and opens up exciting prospects for future research, and potentially new alternative strategies to combat infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>An exact tau-leaping method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gillespie algorithm and its extensions are commonly used for the simulation of chemical reaction networks. A limitation of these algorithms is that they have to process and update the system after every reaction, requiring significant computation. Another class of algorithms, based on the tau-leaping method, is able to simulate multiple reactions at a time at the cost of decreased accuracy. We present a new algorithm for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks that is capable of sampling multiple reactions at a time via a first-order approximation similarly to the tau-leaping methods. We prove that the algorithm has an improved runtime complexity compared to existing methods for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks, and present an efficient and easy to use implementation that outperforms existing methods in practice.</description>
