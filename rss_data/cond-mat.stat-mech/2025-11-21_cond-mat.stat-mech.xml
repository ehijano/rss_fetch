      <title>Effects of Non-reciprocity on Coupled Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All the fundamental interactions (such as gravity or electromagnetic interactions) are reciprocal in nature. However, in the macroscopic world, in particular outside equilibrium, non-reciprocal or non-mutual interactions are quite ubiquitous. Understanding the impact of such non-reciprocal interactions has drawn a significant amount of interest in physics and other fields of sciences in recent years. We explore a non-reciprocal version of coupled oscillators (known as the Kuramoto model) with the aim of understanding the role of non-reciprocity, particularly in relation to chimera states, where oscillators spontaneously break into mutually synchronous and asynchronous groups. Our findings suggest that non-reciprocity not only alters the state diagram of the chimera state significantly but can also lead to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase and coexistence phases.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann-Kolmogorov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a Kolmogorov equation governing the time evolution of the probability distribution defined in phase space. Energy is strictly conserved along a trajectory in phase space, meaning the equation is appropriate to describe an isolated system, and the stationary state is the Gibbs microcanonical distribution. The equation predicts the increase in entropy in agreement with thermodynamics, and in contrast with the Liouville equation, which conserves entropy. Using an approximation in which the distribution is a product of one-particle distributions, we derive the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. We also consider a Kolmogorov equation to describe an open system in contact with the external environment. In this case the equation describes not only the situation in which the system is found in thermodynamic equilibrium with a Gibbs canonical distribution in the stationary state, but also the nonequilibrium steady state with a continuous production of entropy.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium phase transition in single-file transport at high crowding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven particle transport in crowded and confining environments is fundamental to diverse phenomena across physics, chemistry, and biology. A main objective in studying such systems is to identify novel emergent states and phases of collective dynamics. Here, we report on a nonequilibrium phase transition occurring in periodic structures at high particle densities. This transition separates a weak-current phase of thermally activated transport from a high-current phase of solitary wave propagation. It is reflected also in a change of universality classes characterizing correlations of particle current fluctuations. Our findings demonstrate that sudden changes to high current states can occur when increasing particle densities beyond critical values.</description>

      <title>Collective Buckling in Metal-Organic Framework Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework to describe collective buckling in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Starting from the microscopic structure of a single organic linker, we define a buckling coordinate governed by an effective double-well potential. Coupling between linkers arises from dipole-dipole interactions, leading to a lattice Hamiltonian. We analyze the transition between ordered and disordered phases within a mean-field approximation and determine the critical temperature. As an example for our theory, we discuss the collective buckling instability for the prototypical cubic framework MOF-5 under different values of uniaxial strain. Our approach enables a quantitative description of collective buckling in framework materials.</description>

      <title>Resolving Speed and Encoding Bottlenecks in Fast Heteromeric Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cytoplasm is a heterogeneous mixture containing many types of proteins that self-assemble into a wide variety of complexes. The accuracy and speed of cytoplasmic self-assembly is astonishing because it involves the correct identification of components shared among different structures, despite pervasive thermal fluctuations. Typical toy models of self-assembly are based on the specificity of binding energies among components and neglect kinetic effects. However, kinetics plays a key role in biological self-assembly, often catalyzed by a plethora of assembly factors. Building on this observation, we extend a previous heteropolymer growth model to describe the retrieval of two-dimensional structures. We find that the self-assembly of structures in this model is subject to strong speed and encoding bottlenecks. Moreover, we show that these bottlenecks can be suppressed by increasing the connectivity of a small fraction of components. This mechanism of kinetically controlling a small number of critical binding events provides a simple explanation for the timely assembly of large protein, and suggests a unifying principle for the role of assembly factors.</description>

      <title>Height distribution of elastic interfaces in quenched random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic interfaces in quenched random media driven by external forces exhibit a continuous depinning phase transition between pinned and moving phases at a critical external force. Recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 175701 (2022)] has shown that the distribution of local interface heights at depinning displays negative skewness. Here, by considering local, long-range and fully-coupled (mean-field) elasticity, we expand on this result by demonstrating the robustness of the negative skewness at depinning when approaching the thermodynamic limit and considering different values of the spring stiffness controlling the avalanche cutoff. Additionally, we investigate the evolution of the height distribution as the external force is ramped up from zero, approaching the critical force from below. Starting from a symmetric height distribution at zero force, the distribution initially develops positive skewness increasing with the external force, followed by a steep drop to the negative value characteristic of the critical point as the depinning transition is reached.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing thermal versus quantum annealing using probability-flux signatures across interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped to the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which may correspond to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it difficult to design problem instances that fairly compare the two methods. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Comment on: "Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ref. Ansari et al., dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) -- non-analyticities in the Loschmidt return rate at critical times -- are investigated in the presence of noise for a two-band model. The authors report that DQPTs persist even after averaging over the noise and they use their results to derive dynamical phase diagrams. In this comment we rigorously prove that in any two-dimensional Hilbert space the Loschmidt echo of two density matrices can only become zero if and only if both density matrices are pure. As a consequence, the existence of DQPTs in the considered scenario is strictly ruled out for non-zero noise because the considered averaging leads to a mixed state. We also investigate alternative natural ways to average over noise realizations and show that in all of them DQPTs are smoothed out.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors at the thermal first-order transitions of three-dimensional q-state Potts models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like dynamics of three-dimensional $q$-state Potts systems driven across their thermal first-order transition in the thermodynamic limit, by a relaxational (heat-bath) dynamics. During the evolution, the inverse temperature $\beta$ increases linearly with time, as $\delta\beta(t)\equiv \beta(t)- \beta_{\rm fo} \sim t/t_s$, where $\beta_{\rm fo}$ is the inverse temperature at the transition point, $t$ is the time and $t_s$ is a time scale. The dynamics starts at $t_i&lt; 0$ from an ensemble of disordered configurations equilibrated at inverse temperature $\beta(t_i)&lt;\beta_{\rm fo}$ and ends at positive values of $t$, when the system is ordered (this is analogous to a standard Kibble-Zurek protocol). The time-dependent energy density shows an out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit, in terms of the scaling variable $t(\ln t)^\kappa/t_s$. The corresponding exponent turns out to be consistent with $\kappa=3/2$ (with a good accuracy), which is the value obtained by assuming that the initial nucleation of ordered regions provides the relevant mechanism for the passage from one phase to the other. The scaling behavior implies a spinodal-like phenomenon close to the transition point: the passage from the disordered to the ordered phase, composed of large ordered regions of different color, occurs at $\delta\beta(t)=\delta\beta_*&gt;0$, where $\delta\beta_*$ decreases as $1/(\ln t_s)^{3/2}$ in the large-$t_s$ limit.</description>

      <title>Universal TT- and TQ-relations via centrally extended q-Onsager algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We first classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, on which spin-j K-operators constructed in [LBG] act as K-matrices. Using the K-operators and these K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all conserved quantities (Hamiltonians and higher logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix) in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators, which shows existence of non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, in the sense that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As a yet another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. In view of application to diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a certain degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra.</description>

      <title>Universal work statistics in quenched gapless quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the universality of work statistics performed during a quench in gapless quantum systems. We show that the cumulants of work scale separately in the fast and slow quench regimes, following a power law analogous to the universal scaling in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for topological defect formation in phase transition. As an example, we analyze the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quenched Heisenberg XXZ chain at its critical gapless state using the bosonization picture, resulting in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The analytical scaling is in agreement with the exact numerical calculation for the fast and slow quench regimes. In finite systems, the characteristic function display an oscillatory pattern which disappears in the thermodynamic limit. This study is particularly useful for understanding the thermodynamics of adiabatic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Neural optimization of the most probable paths of 3D active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized version of the Wilson-Cowan (WC) model is proposed which accounts for the evolution of the synaptic resources. Adiabatic elimination of the fast variables is performed to yield a simplified framework for the coupled interaction between active excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The latter model is shown to smoothly converge to the benchmark WC model, when the appropriate limit is performed. Different dynamical regimes are identified for the reduced model and commented upon with reference to the original formulation of the generalized dynamics. This includes identifying limit cycle oscillations for population of available resources.</description>

      <title>$c=-2$ conformal field theory in quadratic band touching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic band touching in fermionic systems defines a universality class distinct from that of linear Dirac points, yet its characterization as a quantum critical point remains incomplete. In this work, I show that a $(d+1)$-dimensional free-fermion model with quadratic band touching exhibits spatial conformal invariance, and that its equal-time ground-state correlation functions are exactly captured by the $d$-dimensional symplectic fermion theory. I establish this correspondence by constructing explicit mappings between physical fermionic operators and the fields of the symplectic fermion theory. I further explore the implications of this correspondence in two spatial dimensions, where the symplectic fermion theory is a logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge $c=-2$. In the corresponding $(2+1)$-dimensional systems, I identify anyonic excitations originating from the underlying symplectic fermion theory, even though the Hamiltonian is gapless. Transporting these excitations along non-contractible loops generates transitions among topologically degenerate ground states, in close analogy with those in topologically ordered phases. Moreover, the action of a $2\pi$ rotation on these excitations is represented by a Jordan block, reflecting the logarithmic character of the associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Charge-Ordered States and the Phase Diagram of the Extended Hubbard Model on the Bethe lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extended Hubbard model (EHM) with both onsite Hubbard interaction and the intersite density-density interaction between nearest-neighbors using the standard Hartree mean-field approximation (MFA) on the Bethe lattice. We found that, at the ground state, the system can be in a charge-ordered insulating (COI), a charge-order metallic (COM) or a non-charge-ordered (NO) state. Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches. The method used for the EHM on the Bethe lattice also allows for a series of analytical derivations and simplification to see general geometry-independent features and analytical results, avoiding the numerical inaccuracies and other issues that appear with a purely numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Exact Work Distribution and Jarzynski's Equality of a Relativistic Particle in an Expanding Piston</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium work in a pedagogical model of relativistic ideal gas. We obtain the exact work distribution and verify the Jarzynski's equality. In the non-relativistic limit, our results recover the non-relativistic results [arXiv:cond-mat/0502434]. We also find that, unlike the non-relativistic case, the work distribution no longer has zeros and the number of collisions in this relativistic gas model is finite. In addition, based on an analysis of the experimental parameters, we conclude that it is difficult to detect the relativistic effects of the work distribution of the ideal gas in a piston system with the current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of thermodynamic laws from microscopic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically show that a deep neural network (DNN) can learn macroscopic thermodynamic laws purely from microscopic data. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we generate the data of snapshot images of gas particles undergoing adiabatic processes. We train a DNN to determine the temporal order of input image pairs. We observe that the trained network induces an order relation between states consistent with adiabatic accessibility, satisfying the axioms of thermodynamics. Furthermore, the internal representation learned by the DNN act as an entropy. These results suggest that machine learning can discover emergent physical laws that are valid at scales far larger than those of the underlying constituents -- opening a pathway to data-driven discovery of macroscopic physics.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors across the magnetic first-order transitions of 2D and 3D Ising systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Ising systems, when they are slowly driven across their {\em magnetic} first-order transitions at low temperature $T&lt;T_c$, where $T_c$ is the temperature of their continuous transition. We consider Kibble-Zurek (KZ) protocols in which a spatially homogenous magnetic field $h$ varies as $h(t)=t/t_s$ with a time scale $t_s$. The KZ dynamics starts from negatively-magnetized configurations equilibrated at $h_i&lt;0$ and stops at a positive value of $h$ where the configurations acquire a positive average magnetization. We consider the Metropolis and the heat-bath dynamics, which are two specific examples of a purely relaxational dynamics. We focus on two different dynamic regimes. We consider the out-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) limit in which the system size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$ diverge simultaneously, keeping an appropriate combination fixed. Then, we analyze the KZ dynamics in the thermodynamic limit (TL), obtained by taking first the $L\to\infty$ limit at fixed $t$ and $t_s$, and then considering the scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit. Our numerical results provide evidence of OFSS, as predicted by general scaling arguments. The results in the TL show the emergence of spinodal-like behaviors: The passage from the negatively-magnetized phase to the positively-magnetized one occurs at positive values $h_*&gt;0$ of the magnetic field, which decrease as $h_* \sim 1/(\ln t_s)^\kappa$, with $\kappa = 2$ and $\kappa=1$ in two and three dimensions, respectively, for $t_s\to\infty$. We identify $\sigma \equiv t (\ln t)^\kappa/t_s$ as the relevant scaling variable associated with the KZ dynamics in the TL.</description>

      <title>Evanescent random walker on networks: Hitting times, budget renewal, and survival dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution and Correlation Functions of Generalized Double Ising Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the exact solution and correlation functions for a double-chain Ising model with multi-spin interactions and symmetric Hamiltonian density are obtained. The study employs the transfer matrix method to derive fundamental thermodynamic characteristics of the system. The main results include exact expressions for the partition function, free energy, internal energy, specific heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and entropy in a strip of finite length and in the thermodynamic limit. The work provides explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and shows structure of eigenvectors of the transfer matrix. The expression for magnetization in the thermodynamic limit using components of normalized eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue is obtained. A detailed analysis is conducted for a special case of interactions involving all kinds of two- and four-spin interactions. This gives the simplified formula for free energy, it is calculated using the root of quadratic equation. Using special relation between parameters the solution for gonihedric model on the plane is obtained. The research reveals properties of the system, including specific features of ground states and phase diagram characteristics. Particular attention is given to the behavior of physical quantities near frustration points and the investigation of spin correlation functions. Plots of physical characteristics, including inverse correlation length, illustrating the obtained results are constructed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bounded by crossover lines exhibiting universal scaling, the supercritical regime above the critical endpoint is characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercritical crossover to the quantum critical endpoint (QCEP), by studying the prototypical mixed-field quantum Ising and Potts models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities, near the QCEP. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is found, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is the so-called gap exponent of the QCEP. Moreover, we demonstrate that the QSC crossover line acts as a boundary for the emergence of dynamical singularities in quench dynamics. This singularity manifests as a distinctive cusp with a critical exponent of 1/2, signaling a new dynamical universality class. We also propose utilizing Rydberg atom arrays as an experimental platform to observe these QSC crossovers and dynamical singularities. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the role of QCEP and associated supercritical crossovers in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free-energy differences from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using flow-based generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating the dissipation along an alchemical switching process in terms of a nonadiabatic force field that can be learned through stochastic flow matching. The learned field can be used in conjunction with short-time trajectory data to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the alchemical free energy that variationally converge to the exact value if the field is optimal. Applying the method to evaluate the alchemical free energy of atomistic models shows that it can substantially reduce the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at negligible loss of accuracy when compared with thermodynamic integration.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics in local Lindbladians with chaotic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical consequences of having a spectrum that satisfies random matrix theory (RMT) for generic Lindbladians, and compare its implications for spatially local and completely random Lindblad dynamics in one spatial dimension. We find that Lindbladians whose spectrum is described by RMT exhibit quasi-universal early-time dynamics for quantities non-linear in the density matrix, in the sense that for generic, highly entangled initial states, the early time evolution is independent of the choice of initial state. We numerically investigate how locality generically imposes constraints on the size-dependence of Lindblad eigenoperators. This size dependence implies that linear observables, such as expectation values of local operators, are highly sensitive to eigenmodes outside the bulk of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit, and plays a central role in limiting operator growth in the presence of dissipation. We find that when single-site dissipation dominates, an operator's decoherence scales approximately linearly with its Pauli weight, even in the presence of 2-site jump operators. When two-site only dissipation dominates, however, this generic trend in operator size can be violated for numerically accessible system sizes, leading to long-lived high Pauli-weight operators.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</description>

      <title>Threshold model of language competition including the bilingual state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a threshold model of language competition which includes intermediate bilingual state. The model is based on the Minett-Wang model but through the introduction of thresholds in the language shift rates it incorporates the effects of memory and learning. The model is piecewise-linear, allowing the exact analytical treatment. We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We hybridize the swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation methods to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of the lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. However, ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. Most Nb ions collapse into a single percolating cluster with a mesh-like structure. This specific geometry serves to prevent large space charges, and this behavior differs from typical phase separation in metallic alloys. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function that is consistent with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric properties of PMN.</description>
