      <title>Linnik point spread functions, time-reversed logarithmic diffusion equations, and blind deconvolution of electron microscope imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non iterative direct blind deconvolution procedure, previously used successfully to sharpen Hubble Space Telescope imagery, is now found useful in sharpening nanoscale scanning electron microscope (SEM) and helium ion microscope (HIM) images. The method is restricted to images $g(x,y)$, whose Fourier transforms $\hat{g}(\xi,\eta)$ are such that $log~|\hat{g}(\xi,0)|$ is globally monotone decreasing and convex. The method is not applicable to defocus blurs. A point spread function in the form of a Linnik probability density function is postulated, with parameters obtained by least squares fitting the Fourier transform of the preconditioned microscopy image. Deconvolution is implemented in slow motion by marching backward in time, in Fourier space, from $t = 1$ to $t = 0$, in an associated logarithmic diffusion equation. Best results are usually found in a partial deconvolution at time $\bar{t}$, with $0 &lt; \bar{t} &lt; 1$, rather than in total deconvolution at $t=0$. The method requires familarity with microscopy images, as well as interactive search for optimal parameters.</description>

      <title>Low-energy neutron cross-talk between organic scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of measurements have been performed with low-energy monoenergetic neutrons to characterise cross-talk between two organic scintillator detectors. Cross-talk time-of-flight spectra and probabilities were determined for neutron energies from 1.4 to 15.5 MeV and effective scattering angles ranging from $\sim$50{\deg} to $\sim$100{\deg}. Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating both the active and inactive materials making up the detectors showed reasonable agreement with the measurements. Whilst the time-of-flight spectra were very well reproduced, the cross-talk probabilities were only in approximate agreement with the measurements, with the most significant discrepancies ($\sim$40 %) occurring at the lowest energies. The neutron interaction processes producing cross-talk at the energies explored here are discussed in the light of these results.</description>

      <title>A Milli-Kelvin Atomic Force Microscope Made of Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milli-Kelvin atomic force microscopy (mK-AFM) presents an ongoing experimental challenge due to the intense vibrations in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator and the low cooling power available at mK temperatures. A viable approach is to make the system exceptionally rigid and thermally insulating to decouple external vibrations and isolate heat dissipation from the piezo elements. Here, we present a low-cost and large scan-range mK-AFM that operates below 100 mK. All the essential parts of our mK-AFM, including the scanners, tip assembly, and microscope body, are custom-made of fused silica glass by taking advantage of its high specific modulus, extremely low thermal expansion coefficient, and excellent thermal insulation properties. We carefully balance the scan range (25 ${\mu}$m $\times$ 25 ${\mu}$m), heat dissipation, and stiffness of the system to reach optimal performance at mK temperatures.</description>

      <title>Fiber-based Ultra-High Speed Diffuse Speckle Contrast Analysis System for Deep Blood Flow Sensing Using a Large SPAD Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse speckle contrast analysis (DSCA), also called speckle contrast optical spectroscopy(SCOS), has emerged as a groundbreaking optical imaging technique for tracking dynamic biological processes, including blood flow and tissue perfusion. Recent advancements in single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) cameras have unlocked exceptional capabilities in sensitivity, time resolution, and high frame rate imaging. Despite this, the application of large-format SPAD arrays in speckle contrast analysis is still relatively uncommon. In this study, we introduce a pioneering use of a large format SPAD camera for DSCA. By harnessing the camera's high temporal resolution and photon detection efficiency, we significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of speckle contrast measurements. Our experimental results demonstrate the system's remarkable ability to capture rapid temporal variations over a broad field of view, enabling detailed spatiotemporal analysis. Through simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo studies, we validate the approach's potential for a wide range of biomedical applications, such as cuff occlusion tests and functional tissue monitoring. This work highlights the transformative impact of large SPAD cameras on DSCA, paving the way for new breakthroughs in optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Reservoir Computing and Photoelectrochemical Sensors: A Marriage of Convenience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing technology is an important aspect of information processing. Current development in artificial intelligence systems (especially those aimed at medical and environmental applications) requires a lot of data on the chemical composition of biological fluids or environmental samples. These complex matrices require advanced sensing devices, and photoelectrochemical ones seem to have potential to overcome at least some of the obstacles. Furthermore, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology for autonomous robotics requires technology mimicking human senses, also those operating at the molecular level, such as gustation and olfaction. Again, photoelectrochemical sensing can provide some suitable solutions. In this review, we introduce the idea of integration of photoelectrochemical sensors with some unconventional computing paradigm - reservoir computing. This approach should not only boost the performance of the sensors itself, but also open new pathways through science. Integration of sensing devices with computing systems will also contribute to a better understanding (or at least mimicking) of the human senses and neuromorphic sensory information processing. Although reservoir systems can be considered magic "black boxes" and their operation is at the same time simple and hard to comprehend, this combination is expected to open a new era of effective information harvesting and processing systems.</description>

      <title>Sequential acquisition of fluorescence signals with changing fluorophore concentrations. Multivariate Curve Resolution with time measurements assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential registering of fluorescence signals in conventional Excitation-Emission Matrices (EEMs), followed by modeling based on multilinear properties of the data, requires stable fluorophore concentrations throughout the acquisition of each EEM. Rapid concentration changes, as seen in chromatography or certain kinetics, can disrupt the conventional bilinearity of EEMs. This deviation depends on the relative rates of concentration changes versus spectral scanning speeds. Although entire scans can be slow, individual data points are acquired almost instantaneously, maintaining linear dependencies. Within specific time intervals, concentrations can be assumed constant. By using time-based localization, partial EEM data can be organized into partially filled cubes that allow for the correct modeling of third-order data. Additionally, Multivariate Curve Resolution requires reshaping operations. Two third-order datasets were analyzed using a time-assisted MCR implementation, following a strategy similar to one reported for chromatographic data (LC-EEM) with Parallel Factor Analysis. The second dataset comes from Diclofenac reaction kinetics (Kin-EEM). The results suggest that time-assisted MCR resolves such data effectively. The solutions found were similar to those obtained when processing the same data as cubes. Predictions from calibration models based on MCR results were comparable to those obtained when deriving higher order models from the same data. High degrees of similarity were achieved between resolved and reference spectral profiles. Both chromatographic and kinetic profiles were accurate and physically meaningful. The proposed strategy highlights the potential of incorporating time-based localization to enhance the analysis of fluorescence data in dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Overview of ATLAS forward proton detectors: status, performance and new physics results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key focus of the physics program at the LHC is the study of head-on proton-proton collisions. However, an important class of physics can be studied for cases where the protons narrowly miss one another and remain intact. In such cases, the electromagnetic fields surrounding the protons can interact producing high-energy photon-photon collisions. Alternatively, interactions mediated by the strong force can also result in intact forward scattered protons, providing probes of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In order to aid identification and provide unique information about these rare interactions, the instrumentation to detect and measure protons scattered through very small angles is installed in the beam pipe far downstream of the interaction point. We describe the ATLAS Forward Proton `Roman Pot' detectors (AFP and ALFA), their performance of Tracking and Time-of-Flight detectors, and first results.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the ISOLPHARM gamma camera for Ag-111 imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One consolidated technique for the treatment of cancer is Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT). With this technique, radionuclides are attached to a specific drug that is able to bring them to the target tumor site. The ISOLPHARM project is currently developing a radiopharmaceutical for TRT based on Ag-111, an innovative radionuclide. Ag-111 has a half-life of 7.45 days and decays emitting both electrons and gamma-rays. The emission of gamma-rays, mainly with energy of 342\,keV, allows the Ag-111 nuclei to be visualized through the use of a gamma camera. In this contribution, we describe the Monte Carlo simulation built to optimize the parameters of this imaging device. The software used for this aim is the Geant4 toolkit, which is able to simulate the interaction between particles and matter.</description>

      <title>Simulation Study of Photon-to-Digital Converter (PDC) Timing Specifications for LoLX Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Light only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) experiment is a prototype detector aimed to study liquid xenon (LXe) light properties and various photodetection technologies. LoLX is also aimed to quantify LXe's time resolution as a potential scintillator for 10~ps time-of-flight (TOF) PET. Another key goal of LoLX is to perform a time-based separation of Cerenkov and scintillation photons for new background rejection methods in LXe experiments. To achieve this separation, LoLX is set to be equipped with photon-to-digital converters (PDCs), a photosensor type that provides a timestamp for each observed photon. To guide the PDC design, we explore requirements for time-based Cerenkov separation. We use a PDC simulator, whose input is the light information from the Geant4-based LoLX simulation model, and evaluate the separation quality against time-to-digital converter (TDC) parameters. Simulation results with TDC parameters offer possible configurations supporting a good separation. Compared with the current filter-based approach, simulations show Cerenkov separation level increases from 54% to 71% when using PDC and time-based separation. With the current photon time profile of LoLX simulation, the results also show 71% separation is achievable with just 4 TDCs per PDC. These simulation results will lead to a specification guide for the PDC as well as expected results to compare against future PDC-based experimental measurements. In the longer term, the overall LoLX results will assist large LXe-based experiments and motivate the assembly of a LXe-based TOF-PET demonstrator system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Material Screening at Boulby Underground Laboratory with XIA UltraLo-1800 Alpha Particle Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06925v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boulby UnderGround Screening (BUGS) facility, located at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, has significantly advanced its material screening capabilities by installing two XIA UltraLo-1800 alpha particle detectors. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of one of these detectors, operated 1,100 meters underground at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, which provides significant shielding from cosmic radiation and maintains a low ambient radon activity of 2.30 $\pm$ 0.03 Bq/m$^3$. Our evaluation focuses on energy reconstruction accuracy, background radiation rates, and operational stability. The XIA UltraLo-1800 detector demonstrates remarkable stability in energy reconstruction, with less than 0.1 MeV variation over four years. Moreover, the implementation of a graphite-filled PTFE liner in the sample tray resulted in a significant reduction in background radiation levels compared to measurements with the original stainless steel tray, achieving an average activity of 0.15 $\pm$ 0.01 $\alpha$/cm$^2$/khr. Copper sample assays, performed before and after radon exposure, demonstrated the detector's ability to accurately identify and quantify $^{210}$Po contamination. By implementing the robust cleanliness procedures and protocols described in this article, we observed a reduction in $^{210}$Po activity from 0.504 $\pm$ 0.022 mBq to 0.336 $\pm$ 0.013 mBq, highlighting the crucial role of refined cleaning methods in minimizing background for sensitive experiments. Additionally, observations of elevated background activity levels post-high-activity sample measurements illustrate the need for careful management of assay conditions and environment to maintain low background levels. These results highlight the potential of the XIA UltraLo-1800 in enhancing the precision of material assays essential for reducing background interference in rare event experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) are widely used in particle physics experiments. They use light and charge released in events to reconstruct and analyze them. Light information collected by the Photon Detection System (PDS) is used mainly to determine the initial time stamp, $t_0$, and to support determining the total energy of the event. For these purposes, it is important to simulate and predict the propagation of light inside the detector. There are several approaches to this, and this work discusses some of the options.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Neutron Whispering Gallery States Using a Pulsed Neutron Beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neutron whispering gallery state is a quantum state localized on a material surface bound by the centrifugal force and the material potential. Precise measurements of such quantum states enable tests of quantum mechanics in non-inertial frames, characterization of the surface potential, and searches for hypothetical short-range interactions at the nanometer scale. We observed a neutron whispering gallery state on a $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ concave mirror using a pulsed cold neutron beam. The measured results agree with theoretical calculations within $1.9\%$ for the centrifugal acceleration $a \approx 7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, which is due to unmodeled deviations of the shape of the concave mirror edge from an ideal one. We found that the sensitivity itself was $1\times 10^{-4}$, which is two orders of magnitude better than the above agreement.</description>
