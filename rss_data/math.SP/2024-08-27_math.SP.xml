      <title>Random eigenvalues of nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hexagonal lattice and its dual, the triangular lattice, serve as powerful models for comprehending the atomic and ring connectivity, respectively, in \textit{graphene} and \textit{carbon $(p,q)$--nanotubes}. The chemical and physical attributes of these two carbon allotropes are closely linked to the average number of closed paths of different lengths $k\in\mathbb{N}_0$ on their respective graph representations. Considering that a carbon $(p,q)$--nanotube can be thought of as a graphene sheet rolled up in a matter determined by the \textit{chiral vector} $(p,q)$, our findings are based on the study of \textit{random eigenvalues} of both the hexagonal and triangular lattices presented in \cite{bille2023random}. This study reveals that for any given \textit{chiral vector} $(p,q)$, the sequence of counts of closed paths forms a moment sequence derived from a functional of two independent uniform distributions. Explicit formulas for key characteristics of these distributions, including probability density function (PDF) and moment generating function (MGF), are presented for specific choices of the chiral vector. Moreover, we demonstrate that as the \textit{circumference} of a $(p,q)$--nanotube approaches infinity, i.e., $p+q\rightarrow \infty$, the $(p,q)$--nanotube tends to converge to the hexagonal lattice with respect to the number of closed paths for any given length $k$, indicating weak convergence of the underlying distributions.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex hypersurfaces in the half-space with capillary boundary. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to [16, Conjecture 1.5] on the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for quermassintegrals for convex capillary hypersurfaces in the Euclidean half-space. More generally, we establish a theory for capillary convex bodies in the half-space and prove a general Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for mixed volumes of capillary convex bodies. The conjecture [16, Conjecture 1.5] follows as its consequence.</description>

      <title>The free energy of dilute Bose gases at low temperatures interacting via strong potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dilute Bose gas in the thermodynamic limit and prove a lower bound on the free energy for low temperatures which is in agreement with the conjecture of Lee-Huang-Yang on the excitation spectrum of the system. Combining techniques of \cite{FS2} and \cite{HHNST}, we give a simpler and shorter proof resolving the case of strong interactions, including the hard-core potential.</description>

      <title>Trace formulas and inverse spectral theory for generalized indefinite strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized indefinite strings provide a canonical model for self-adjoint operators with simple spectrum (other classical models are Jacobi matrices, Krein strings and 2x2 canonical systems). We prove a number of Szeg\H{o}-type theorems for generalized indefinite strings and related spectral problems (including Krein strings, canonical systems and Dirac operators). More specifically, for several classes of coefficients (that can be regarded as Hilbert-Schmidt perturbations of model problems), we provide a complete characterization of the corresponding set of spectral measures. In particular, our results also apply to the isospectral Lax operator for the conservative Camassa-Holm flow and allow us to establish existence of global weak solutions with various step-like initial conditions of low regularity via the inverse spectral transform.</description>

      <title>Mourre theory and spectral analysis of energy-momentum operators in relativistic quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central task of theoretical physics is to analyse spectral properties of quantum mechanical observables. In this endeavour, Mourre's conjugate operator method emerged as an effective tool in the spectral theory of Schr\"odinger operators. This paper introduces a novel class of examples from relativistic quantum field theory that are amenable to Mourre's method. By assuming Lorentz covariance and the spectrum condition, we derive a limiting absorption principle for the energy-momentum operators and provide new proofs of the absolute continuity of the energy-momentum spectra. Moreover, under the assumption of dilation covariance, we show that the spectrum of the relativistic mass operator is purely absolutely continuous in $(0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization for random scattering zippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a proof of dynamical localization for a random scattering zipper model. The scattering zipper operator is the product of two unitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right by random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this configuration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To prove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of fractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the Lyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the exponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices. We then establish an explicit formula of the coefficients of the finite resolvent in terms of the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's complement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential decay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization.</description>
