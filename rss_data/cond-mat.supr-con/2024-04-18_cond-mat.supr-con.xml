      <title>Investigation of Quasi-particle Relaxation in Strongly Disordered Superconductor Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quasi-particle (QP) relaxation of strongly disordered superconducting resonators under optical illumination at different bath temperatures with the Rothwarf and Taylor equations and the gap-broadening theory described by the Usadal equation. The analysis is validated with various single-photon responses of Titanium Nitride (TiN) microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) under pulsed 405~nm laser illumination. The QP relaxation in TiN is dominated by QPs with energy below the energy gap smeared by the disorder, and its duration is still inversely proportional to the QP density. The QP lifetime versus temperature can be fitted. The relaxation of the resonator can be further modeled with QP diffusion. The fitted QP diffusion coefficient of TiN is significantly smaller than expected. Our result also shows a significant increase in QP generation efficiency as the bath temperature increases.</description>

      <title>Existence of Hebel-Slichter peak in unconventional kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical investigation of the spin susceptibility of unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice. Despite the existence of a sign-changing gap structure, which sums to zero over the Fermi surface, we show that such unconventional pairing states may exhibit a Hebel-Slichter peak in the temperature-dependent spin-lattice relaxation rate. It originates from destructive sublattice interference effects. For the same reason, unconventional pairing states on the kagome lattice tend not to exhibit a neutron resonance peak. These results supplement previous theoretical studies of the surprising robustness of sign-changing gap structures to disorder on the kagome lattice. Taken together these findings imply that unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice is deceptive in the sense that its properties may appear similar to conventional non-sign-changing superconductivity. These results may be of relevance to the superconducting state of the kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$: K, Rb, Cs) and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$.</description>

      <title>Modulation of the Octahedral Structure and Potential Superconductivity of La3Ni2O7 at Ambient Pressure by Compressive Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity at Tc = 80 K has recently been reported above 14 GPa in La3Ni2O7, which thus introduces a new family of high-temperature superconductors. Using a first-principles calculation with Coulomb repulsion, we unveil a surprising new route to obtain superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure by introducing compressive strain along the [001] direction. The shape of the NiO6 octahedra affect the Ni-3dz2 density of states (DOS) at Fermi level, and it can be modulated by applying compressive strain instead of hydrostatic pressure. Notably, when the octahedral regularity parameter defined herein is R ~ 4%, La3Ni2O7 acquires a high Ni-3dz2 DOS and hole Fermi pocket. Our study thus indicates a path for obtaining superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure and elucidates the relationship between structural properties and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Exact Demonstration of pair-density-wave superconductivity in the $\sigma_z$-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing and achieving `unconventional' superconductivity remains a forefront challenge in quantum many-body physics. Here we use a unitary mapping, combined with the well-established properties of the attractive Hubbard model to demonstrate rigorously a Hamiltonian with a low temperature pair-density-wave (PDW) phase. We also show that the same mapping, when applied to the widely accepted properties of the repulsive Hubbard model, leads to a Hamiltonian exhibiting triplet $d$-wave PDW superconductivity and an unusual combination of ferro- and antiferro-magnetic spin correlations. We then demonstrate the persistence of the $d$-wave PDW in a Hamiltonian derived from the mapping of the extended $t$-$J$ model in the large-$U$ limit. Furthermore, through strategic manipulation of the nearest-neighbor hopping signs of spin-down electrons, we illustrate the attainability of PDW superconductivity at other momenta. The intertwining of different magnetic and exotic pairing correlations noted here may have connections to experimental observations in spin-triplet candidates like UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling superconductivity and weak vortex pinning in Ta-doped CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By measuring magnetizations of pristine and Ta-doped CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ single crystals, we have carried out systematic studies on the lower critical field, critical current density, and equilibrium magnetization of this kagome system. The lower critical field has been investigated in the two typical samples, and the temperature dependent lower critical field obtained in Ta-doped sample can be fitted by using the model with two $s$-wave superconducting gaps yielding the larger gap of $2\Delta_{s1}/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{c}=7.9\;(\pm1.8)$. This indicates a strong-coupling feature of the V-based superconductors. The measured magnetization hysteresis loops allow us to calculate the critical current density, which shows a very weak bulk vortex pinning. The magnetization hysteresis loops measured in these two kinds of samples can be well described by a recently proposed generalized phenomenological model, which leads to the determination of many fundamental parameters for these superconductors. Our systematic results and detailed analysis conclude that this V-based kagome system has features of strong-coupling superconductivity, relatively large Ginzburg-Landau parameter and weak vortex coupling.</description>

      <title>Local pairing versus bulk superconductivity intertwined by the charge density wave order in Cs(V$_{1-x}$Ta$_{x}$)$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a common belief that superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) order accommodate homogenously in real space but compete with each other for the effective density of states in momentum space in CDW superconductors. By measuring resistivity along the $c$-axis in Cs(V$_{1-x}$Ta$_{x}$)$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, we observe strong superconducting fluctuation behavior coexisting with the CDW order in the pristine CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, and the fluctuation region becomes narrowed when the Ta doping suppresses the CDW order. The onset transition temperature barely changes with the Ta doping. Therefore, the bulk superconductivity may be established by a doping-independent local pairing, and it can be suppressed in some regions by the spatially variable CDW order along the $c$-axis. Our results violate the above-mentioned belief about CDW superconductors and demonstrate the intricate interaction between superconductivity and CDW order in this kagome superconductor.</description>

      <title>A numerical approach to levitated superconductors and its application to a superconducting cylinder in a quadrupole field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically levitated superconductors in the Meissner state can be utilized as micro-mechanical oscillators with large mass, high quality factors and long coherence times. In previous works analytical solutions for the magnetic field distribution around a superconducting sphere in a quadrupole field have been found and used to derive the trap parameters, while non-spherical geometries have only been investigated in a few idealized cases. However, superconductors of almost arbitrary shape can be used as levitators in a magnetic trap and, as the trap's properties depend strongly on the superconductors shape, allow for a wider parameter regime to be accessed. Finite element models are suitable to obtain the field distribution around arbitrarily shaped superconductors in arbitrary fields, but have not yet been used widely in the context of levitated superconductors. Here we present a simple numerical model for this purpose and use it to calculate the field distribution around cylindrical superconductors in a quadrupole field and to evaluate the trap parameters. We find that the cylindrical shape, compared to spherical levitators, allows for substantially higher trap frequencies and coupling strengths. This in turn reduces the demands on vibration isolation and significantly eases the requirements for feedback cooling to the ground state. The numerical model is provided as supplemental material and can easily be adapted to various geometries and trap fields.</description>

      <title>Pressure-driven dome-shaped superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistivity, and ac magnetic susceptibility in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, with a hydrostatic pressure up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a bilayer orthorhombic structure (space group $Amam$) at ambient pressure and a transformation into a tetragonal phase (space group $I4/mmm$) at a critical pressure of $\sim$14 GPa. The transport measurements reveal a dome-shaped superconducting region with a maximum $T_c$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. The superconductivity is gradually suppressed when applying a higher pressure, but it can persist up to 90 GPa. Importantly, from our high-pressure $ac$ magnetic susceptibility measurements, the estimated maximum superconducting volume fraction is 48$\%$ at 19.4 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. The intimate connection among the superconductivity, the oxygen content, and the tetragonal structure are discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic solutions for vortex clustering in two-band type-1.5 superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that two-band superconductors exhibit a distinct phase characterized by two correlation lengths, where one is smaller and the other larger than the magnetic field penetration length. This regime was coined type-1.5 superconductivity, with a number of unconventional properties, such as vortex clustering. However a fully microscopic solution for vortex clusters has remained challenging due to computational complexities beyond quasiclassical models. In this work, we present numerical solutions obtained in a fully self-consistent two-band Bogoliubov-de-Gennes model. We show the presence of discrepant correlation lengths leading to vortex clustering in two-band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Efficient anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg calculations with the Intermediate Representation basis and Wannier interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we combine the ab initio Migdal-Eliashberg approach with the intermediate representation for the Green's function, enabling accurate and efficient calculations of the momentum-dependent superconducting gap function while fully considering the effect of the Coulomb retardation. Unlike the conventional scheme that relies on a uniform sampling across Matsubara frequencies - demanding hundreds to thousands of points - the intermediate representation works with fewer than 100 sampled Matsubara Green's functions. The developed methodology is applied to investigate the superconducting properties of three representative low-temperature elemental metals: aluminum (Al), lead (Pb), and niobium (Nb). The results demonstrate the power and reliability of our computational technique to accurately solve the ab initio anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations even at extremely low temperatures, below 1 Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian zero-energy pinning of Andreev and Majorana bound states in superconductor-semiconductor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Majorana bound states in finite length superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems has been predicted to occur in the form of oscillatory energy levels with parity crossings around zero energy. Each zero-energy crossing is expected to produce a quantized zero-bias conductance peak but several studies have reported conductance peaks pinned at zero energy over a range of Zeeman fields, whose origin, however, is not clear. In this work we consider superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling under a Zeeman field and demonstrate that non-Hermitian effects, due to coupling to ferromagnet leads, induce zero-energy pinning of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states. We find that this zero-energy pinning effect occurs due to the formation of non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points, whose emergence can be controlled by the interplay of non-Hermiticity, the applied Zeeman field, and chemical potentials. Moreover, depending on the non-Hermitian spatial profile, we find that non-Hermiticity changes the single point Hermitian topological phase transition into a flattened zero energy line bounded by exceptional points from multiple low energy levels. This seemingly innocent change notably enables a gap closing well below the Hermitian topological phase transition, which can be in principle simpler to achieve. Furthermore, we reveal that the energy gap separating Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states from the quasicontinuum remains robust for the values that give rise to the zero-energy pinning effect. While reasonable values of non-Hermiticity can be indeed beneficial, very strong non-Hermitian effects can be detrimental as it might destroy superconductivity. Our findings can be therefore useful for understanding the zero-energy pinning of trivial and topological states in Majorana devices.</description>

      <title>Negatively enhanced thermopower near a Van Hove singularity in electron-doped Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered perovskite Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ serves as a model material of the two-dimensional (2D) Fermi liquid but also exhibits various emergent phenomena including the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior under external perturbations such as uniaxial pressure and chemical substitutions. Here we present the thermoelectric transport of electron-doped system Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$, in which a filling-induced Lifshitz transition occurs at the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point of $y\approx 0.2$. We find that the sign of the low-temperature thermopower becomes negative only near the VHS point, where the NFL behavior has been observed in the earlier work. This observation is incompatible with either a numerical calculation within a constant relaxation-time approximation or a toy-model calculation for the 2D Lifshitz transition adopting an elastic carrier scattering. As a promising origin of the observed negatively enhanced thermopower, we propose a skewed NFL state, in which an inelastic scattering with a considerable odd-frequency term plays a crucial role to negatively enhance the thermopower.</description>

      <title>Second Dome of Superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ at High Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence is growing that a second dome of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity can be accessed in the cuprates by increasing the doping beyond the first dome. Here we use \emph{ab initio} methods without invoking any free parameters, such as the Hubbard $U$, to reveal that pressure could turn YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ into an ideal candidate for second-dome-superconductivity, displaying the predicted signature of strongly hybridized $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Notably, pressure is found to induce a phase transition replacing the antiferromagnetic phases with an orbitally-degenerate $d$--$d$ phase. Our study suggests that the origin of the second dome is correlated with the oxygen-hole fraction in the CuO$_2$ planes and the collapse of the pseudogap phase.</description>

      <title>Theory of Majorana zero modes in unconventional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana fermions are spin-1/2 neutral particles that are their own antiparticles and were initially predicted by Ettore Majorana in particle physics but their observation still remains elusive. The concept of Majorana fermions has been borrowed into condensed matter physics, where, unlike particle physics, Majorana fermions emerge as zero-energy quasiparticles that can be engineered by combining electrons and holes and have therefore been coined Majorana zero modes. In this review, we provide a pedagogical explanation of the basic properties of Majorana zero modes in unconventional superconductors and their consequences in experimental observables, putting a special emphasis on the initial theoretical discoveries. In particular, we first show that Majorana zero modes are self-conjugated and emerge as a special type of zero energy surface Andreev bound states at the boundary of unconventional superconductors. We then explore Majorana zero modes in one-dimensional spin-polarized $p$-wave superconductors, where we address the formation of topological superconductivity and the physical realization in superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this part we highlight that Majorana quasiparticles appear as zero-energy edge states, exhibiting charge neutrality, spin-polarized, and spatial nonlocality as unique properties that can be already seen from their energies and wavefunctions. Next, we discuss analytically obtained Green's functions of $p$-wave superconductors and demonstrate that the emergence of Majorana zero modes is always accompanied by the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing as a unique result of the self-conjugate nature of Majorana zero modes. We finally address the signatures of Majorana zero modes in tunneling spectroscopy, including the anomalous proximity effect, and the phase-biased Josephson effect.</description>
