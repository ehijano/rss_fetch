      <title>Global strong solution of the 3D inhomogeneous liquid crystal flows with density-dependent viscosity and large velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the initial boundary value problem of three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible liquid crystal flows with density-dependent viscosity. When the viscosity coefficient $\mu(\rho)$ is a power function of the density with the power larger than $1$, that is $\mu(\rho)=\mu\rho^\alpha$ with $\alpha&gt;1$, it is proved that the system exists a unique global strong solution as long as the initial density is sufficiently large and $L^3$-norm of the derivative of the initial director is sufficiently small. This is the first result concerning the global strong solution for three-dimensional inhomogeneous liquid crystal flows without smallness of velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the generalized fractional Korteweg-de Vries equation $$ u_t+D^\alpha u_x + u^p u_x= 0, \quad 1&lt;\alpha\le 2, \quad p\in {\mathbb N}\setminus\{0\}, $$ with homogeneous initial data $\Phi$. We show that, under smallness assumption on $\Phi$, and for a wide range of $(\alpha, p)$, including $p=3$, we can construct a self-similar solution of this problem.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness and Scattering for the Focusing Energy-critical Inhomogeneous Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation with Non-radial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the focusing energy-critical inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation \[ iu_t + \Delta u = -|x|^{-b}|u|^{\alpha}u \] where $n \geq 3$, $0&lt;b&lt;\min(2, n/2)$, and $\alpha=(4-2b)/(n-2)$. We prove the global well-posedness and scattering for every $n \geq 3$, $0&lt;b&lt;\min(2, n/2)$, and every non-radial initial data $\phi \in \dot{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ by the concentration compactness arguments of Kenig and Merle (2006) as in the work of Guzman and Murphy (2021). Lorentz spaces are adopted during the development of the stability theory in critical spaces as in Killip and Visan (2013). The result improves multiple earlier works by providing a unified approach to the scattering problem, accepting both focusing and defocusing cases, and eliminating the radial-data assumption and additional restrictions to the range of $n$ and $b$.</description>

      <title>An inverse Cauchy problem of a stochastic hyperbolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an inverse Cauchy problem for a stochastic hyperbolic equation. A Lipschitz type observability estimate is established using a pointwise Carleman identity. By minimizing the constructed Tikhonov-type functional, we obtain a regularized approximation to the problem. The properties of the approximation are studied by means of the Carleman estimate and Riesz representation theorem. Leveraging kernel-based learning theory, we simulate numerical algorithms based on the proposed regularization method. These reconstruction algorithms are implemented and validated through several numerical experiments, demonstrating their feasibility and accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of liquid jets plays an important role in physics and engineering, and needs rigorous mathematical investigations. Recently, Huang-Karakhanyan proved the first local well-posedness in Sobolev spaces for axisymmetric jets. In this paper, we will extend this result to general jets, namely without any axisymmetry condition.</description>

      <title>Calculus for parametric boundary problems with global projection conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pseudodifferential calculus for parameter-dependent operators on smooth manifolds with boundary in the spirit of Boutet de Monvel's algebra is constructed. The calculus contains, in particular, the resolvents of realizations of differential operators subject to global projection boundary conditions (spectral boundary conditions are a particular example); resolvent trace asymptotics are easily derived. The calculus is related to but different from the calculi developed by Grubb and Grubb-Seeley. We use ideas from the theory of pseudodifferential operators on manifolds with edges due to Schulze, in particular the concept of operator-valued symbols twisted by a group-action. Parameter-ellipticity in the calculus is characterized by the invertibility of three principal symbols: the homogeneous principal symbol, the principal boundary symbol, and the so-called principal limit symbol. The principal boundary symbol has, in general, a singularity in the co-variable/parameter space, the principal limit symbol is a new ingredient of our calculus.</description>

      <title>On solutions to a class of degenerate equations with the Grushin operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grushin Laplacian $- \Delta_\alpha $ is a degenerate elliptic operator in $\mathbb{R}^{h+k}$ that degenerates on $\{0\} \times \mathbb{R}^k$. We consider weak solutions of $- \Delta_\alpha u= Vu$ in an open bounded connected domain $\Omega$ with $V \in W^{1,\sigma}(\Omega)$ and $\sigma &gt; Q/2$, where $Q = h + (1+\alpha)k$ is the so-called homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{R}^{h+k}$. By means of an Almgren-type monotonicity formula we identify the exact asymptotic blow-up profile of solutions on degenerate points of $\Omega$. As an application we derive strong unique continuation properties for solutions.</description>

      <title>Solvability for the Ginzburg-Landau equation linearized at the degree-one vortex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the plane linearized around the standard degree-one vortex solution $W(x)=w(r)e^{i\theta}$. Using explicit representation formulae for the Fourier modes in $\theta$, we obtain sharp estimates for the inverse of the linearized operator which hold for a large class of right-hand sides. This theory can be applied, for example, to estimate the inverse after dropping the usual orthogonality conditions.</description>

      <title>A note on traces for the Heisenberg calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we gave a local formula for the index of Heisenberg elliptic operators on contact manifolds. We constructed a cocycle in periodic cyclic cohomology which, when paired with the Connes-Chern character of the principal Heisenberg symbol, calculates the index. A crucial ingredient of our index formula was a new trace on the algebra of Heisenberg pseudodifferential operators. The construction of this trace was rather involved. In the present paper, we clarify the nature of this trace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Plateau's problem seeks to determine a surface of minimal area which spans a given boundary. It is widely studied for its varied mathematical formulations, applications and relevance to physical models such as soap films. We revisit the problem and study a soap film model in the spirit of capillarity formulations in two dimensions. Our approach introduces a nonlocal geometric potential in the variational length minimization scheme. This incorporates effects of thickness of soap films and provides insight into addressing the so-called collapsing phenomenon and other observable physical phenomena and properties.</description>

      <title>A finite difference method with symmetry properties for the high-dimensional Bratu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the three-dimensional (3D) Bratu equation is highly challenging due to the presence of multiple and sharp solutions. Research on this equation began in the late 1990s, but there are no satisfactory results to date. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric finite difference method (SFDM) which embeds the symmetry properties of the solutions into a finite difference method (FDM). This SFDM is primarily used to obtain more accurate solutions and bifurcation diagrams for the 3D Bratu equation. Additionally, we propose modifying the Bratu equation by incorporating a new constraint that facilitates the construction of bifurcation diagrams and simplifies handling the turning points. The proposed method, combined with the use of sparse matrix representation, successfully solves the 3D Bratu equation on grids of up to $301^3$ points. The results demonstrate that SFDM outperforms all previously employed methods for the 3D Bratu equation. Furthermore, we provide bifurcation diagrams for the 1D, 2D, 4D, and 5D cases, and accurately identify the first turning points in all dimensions. All simulations indicate that the bifurcation diagrams of the Bratu equation on the cube domains closely resemble the well-established behavior on the ball domains described by Joseph and Lundgren [1]. Furthermore, when SFDM is applied to linear stability analysis, it yields the same largest real eigenvalue as the standard FDM despite having fewer equations and variables in the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>An elliptic proof of the splitting theorems from Lorentzian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the splitting theorems from Lorentzian geometry, in which simplicity is gained by sacrificing linearity of the d'Alembertian to recover ellipticity. We exploit a negative homogeneity (non-uniformly) elliptic $p$-d'Alembert operator for this purpose. This allows us to bring the Eschenburg, Galloway, and Newman Lorentzian splitting theorems into a framework closer to the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Solvability for non-smooth Schr\"{o}dinger equations with singular potentials and square integrable data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.11901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a holomorphic functional calculus for first-order operators $DB$ to solve boundary value problems for Schr\"{o}dinger equations $-\mathrm{div}\, A \nabla u + a V u = 0$ in the upper half-space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This relies on quadratic estimates for $DB$, which are proved for coefficients $A,a,V$ that are independent of the transversal direction to the boundary, and comprised of a complex-elliptic pair $(A,a)$ that are bounded and measurable, and a singular potential $V$ in either $L^{n/2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ or the reverse H\"{o}lder class $B^{q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $q\geq\max\{\tfrac{n}{2},2\}$. In the latter case, square function bounds are also shown to be equivalent to non-tangential maximal function bounds. This allows us to prove that the (Dirichlet) Regularity and Neumann boundary value problems with $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$-data are well-posed if and only if certain boundary trace operators defined by the functional calculus are isomorphisms. We prove this property when the principal coefficient matrix $A$ has either a Hermitian or block structure. More generally, the set of all complex coefficients for which the boundary value problems are well-posed is shown to be open.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00395v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for multiscale analysis of elliptic operators with high-contrast random coefficients. For a general class of such operators, we provide a detailed spectral analysis of the corresponding homogenised limit operator. Under some lenient assumptions on the configuration of the random inclusions, we fully characterise the limit of the spectra of the high-contrast operators in question, which unlike in the periodic setting is shown to be different to the spectrum of the homogenised operator. Introducing a new notion of the relevant limiting spectrum, we describe the connection between these two sets.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of the pressure for weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations on a bounded domain $\Omega$ with $C^4$ boundary. We prove that if the velocity field $u \in C^{0,\alpha} (\Omega)$ with $\alpha &gt; 0$ (where we are omitting the time dependence), it follows that the corresponding pressure $p$ of a weak solution to the Euler equations belongs to the H\"older space $C^{0, \alpha} (\Omega)$. We also prove that away from the boundary $p$ has $C^{0,2\alpha}$ regularity.
  In order to prove these results we use a local parametrisation of the boundary and a very weak formulation of the boundary condition for the pressure of the weak solution, as was introduced in [C. Bardos and E.S. Titi, Philos. Trans. Royal Soc. A, 380 (2022), 20210073], which is different than the commonly used boundary condition for classical solutions of the Euler equations. Moreover, we provide an explicit example illustrating the necessity of this new very weak formulation of the boundary condition for the pressure. Furthermore, we also provide a rigorous derivation of this new formulation of the boundary condition for weak solutions of the Euler equations.
  This result is of importance for the proof of the first half of the Onsager Conjecture, the sufficient conditions for energy conservation of weak solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in bounded domains. In particular, the results in this paper remove the need for separate regularity assumptions on the pressure in the proof of the Onsager conjecture.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional approximation of measures in Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational approach to approximate measures with measures uniformly distributed over a 1 dimentional set. The problem consists in minimizing a Wasserstein distance as a data term with a regularization given by the length of the support. As it is challenging to prove existence of solutions to this problem, we propose a relaxed formulation, which always admits a solution. In the sequel we show that if the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^2$ , under techinical assumptions, any solution to the relaxed problem is a solution to the original one. Finally we manage to prove that any optimal solution to the relaxed problem, and hence also to the original, is Ahlfors regular.</description>

      <title>Geometry and analytic properties of the sliced Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein metric compares probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by taking averages of the Wasserstein distances between projections of the measures to lines. The distance has found a range of applications in statistics and machine learning, as it is easier to approximate and compute in high dimensions than the Wasserstein distance. While the geometry of the Wasserstein metric is quite well understood, and has led to important advances, very little is known about the geometry and metric properties of the sliced Wasserstein (SW) metric. Here we show that when the measures considered are ``nice'' (e.g. within a positive multiples of the Lebesgue measure) then the SW metric is comparable to the (homogeneous) negative Sobolev norm $\dot H^{-(d+1)/2}$. On the other hand when the measures considered are close in the infinity transportation metric to a discrete measure, then the SW metric between them is close to a multiple of the Wasserstein metric. We characterize the tangent space of the SW space, show that the speed of curves in the space can be described by a quadratic form, but that the SW space is not a length space. We establish a number of properties of the metric given by the minimal length of curves between measures -- the SW length. Finally we highlight the consequences of these properties to the gradient flows in the SW metric.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing concentration phenomena of an anisotropic sinh-Poisson type equation with a Hardy or H\'{e}non term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following anisotropic sinh-Poisson tpye equation with a Hardy or H\'{e}non term:
  $$-\mathrm{div} (a(x)\nabla u)+ a(x)u=\varepsilon^2a(x)|x-q|^{2\alpha}(e^u-e^{-u}) \quad\mathrm{in}\quad \Omega,$$ $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0,\quad \mathrm{on}\quad \partial\Omega,$$ where $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $q\in \bar\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, $\alpha \in(-1,\infty)- \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a smooth bounded domain, $n$ is the unit outward normal vector of $\partial \Omega$ and $a(x)$ is a smooth positive function defined on $\bar\Omega$. From finite dimensional reduction method, we proved that this problem has a sequence of sign-changing solutions with arbitrarily many interior spikes accumulating to $q$, provided $q\in \Omega$ is a local maximizer of $a(x)$. However, if $q\in \partial \Omega$ is a strict local maximum point of $a(x)$ and satisfies $\langle \nabla a(q),n \rangle=0$, we proved that this problem has a family of sign-changing solutions with arbitrarily many mixed interior and boundary spikes accumulating to $q$.
  Under the same condition, we could also construct a sequence of blow-up solutions for the following problem $$ -\mathrm{div} (a(x)\nabla u)+ a(x)u=\varepsilon^2a(x)|x-q|^{2\alpha}e^u\quad \mathrm{in} \quad\Omega,$$ $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0, \quad \mathrm{on}\quad \partial\Omega.$$</description>

      <title>The 2D Muskat Problem I: Local Regularity on the Half-plane, Plane, and Strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove local well-posedness for the Muskat problem on the half-plane, which models motion of an interface between two fluids of distinct densities (e.g., oil and water) in a porous medium (e.g., an aquifer) that sits atop an impermeable layer (e.g., bedrock). Our result allows for the interface to touch the bottom, and hence applies to the important scenario of the heavier fluid invading a region occupied by the lighter fluid along the impermeable layer. We use this result in the companion paper [43] to prove existence of finite time stable regime singularities in this model, including for arbitrarily small initial data. We do not require the interface and its derivatives to vanish at $\pm\infty$ or be periodic, and even allow it to be $O(|x|^{1-})$, which is an optimal bound on the power of growth. We also extend our results to the cases of the Muskat problem on the whole plane and on horizontal strips, where almost all previous works did impose such limiting requirements.</description>

Abstract: We study the Muskat problem on the half-plane, which models motion of an interface between two fluids of distinct densities (e.g., oil and water) in a porous medium (e.g., an aquifer) that sits atop an impermeable layer (e.g., bedrock). Existence of finite time stable regime interface curve singularities is still open on the whole plane, but we show that they do arise on the half-plane, including from arbitrarily small smooth initial data. To obtain this result, we establish maximum principles for both the potential energy and the slope of solutions in this model, as well as develop a general local well-posedness theory in the companion paper [25].</description>

      <title>Boundary unique continuation in planar domains by conformal mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a chord arc domain. We give a simple proof of the the following fact, which is commonly known to be true: a nontrivial harmonic function which vanishes continuously on a relatively open set of the boundary cannot have the norm of the gradient which vanishes on a subset of positive surface measure (arc length). This result is conjectured to be true in higher dimensions by Lin, in Lipschitz domains. Let now $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a $C^1$ domain with Dini mean oscillations. We prove that a nontrivial harmonic function which vanishes continuously on a relatively open subset of the boundary $\partial\Omega\cap B_1$ has a finite number of critical points in $\overline\Omega\cap B_{1/2}$. The latter improves some recent results by Kenig and Zhao. Our technique involves a conformal mapping which moves the boundary where the harmonic function vanishes into an interior nodal line of a new harmonic function, after a further reflection. Then, size estimates of the critical set - up to the boundary - of the original harmonic function can be understood in terms of estimates of the \emph{interior} critical set of the new harmonic function and of the critical set - up to the boundary - of the conformal mapping.</description>

      <title>Standing waves for nonlinear Hartree type equations: existence and qualitative properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider systems of the form \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} -\Delta u + u = \frac{2p}{p+q}(I_\alpha \ast |v|^{q})|u|^{p-2}u \ \ \textrm{ in } \mathbb{R}^N, \\ -\Delta v + v = \frac{2q}{p+q}(I_\alpha \ast |u|^{p})|v|^{q-2}v \ \ \textrm{ in } \mathbb{R}^N, \end{array} \right. \] for $\alpha\in (0, N)$, $\max\left\{\frac{2\alpha}{N}, 1\right\} &lt; p, q &lt; 2^*$ and $\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N} &lt; p+ q &lt; 2^{*}_{\alpha}$, where $I_\alpha$ denotes the Riesz potential, \[ 2^* = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}\frac{2N}{N-2} \ \ \text{for} \ \ N\geq 3,\\ +\infty \ \ \text{for} \ \ N =1,2, \end{array}\right. \quad \text{and} \quad 2^*_{\alpha} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N-2} \ \ \text{for} \ \ N\geq 3,\\ +\infty \ \ \text{for} \ \ N =1,2. \end{array} \right. \] This type of systems arises in the study of standing wave solutions for a certain approximation of the Hartree theory for a two-component attractive interaction. We prove existence and some qualitative properties for ground state solutions, such as definite sign for each component, radial symmetry and sharp asymptotic decay at infinity, and a regularity/integrability result for the (weak) solutions. Moreover, we show that the straight lines $p+q=\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N}$ and $ p+ q = 2^{*}_{\alpha}$ are critical for the existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for Serrin's overdetermined problems in Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in studying Serrin's overdetermined problems in Riemannian manifolds. For manifolds endowed with a conformal vector field, we prove a Pohozoaev-type identity to show a Serrin's type rigidity result using the P-function approach introduced by Weinberger. We proceed with a conformal change to achieve this goal, starting from a geometric Pohozaev identity due to Schoen. Moreover, we obtain a symmetry result for the associated Dirichlet problem by using a generalized normalized wall shear stress bound.</description>
