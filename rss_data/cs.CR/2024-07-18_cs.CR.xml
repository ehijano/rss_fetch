      <title>The Elephant in the Room: Software and Hardware Security Vulnerabilities of Portable Sequencing Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portable genome sequencing technology is revolutionizing genomic research by providing a faster, more flexible method of sequencing DNA and RNA [1, 2]. The unprecedented shift from bulky stand-alone benchtop equipment confined in a laboratory setting to small portable devices which can be easily carried anywhere outside the laboratory network and connected to untrusted external computers to perform sequencing raises new security and privacy threats not considered before. Current research primarily addresses the privacy of DNA/RNA data in online databases [3] and the security of stand-alone sequencing devices such as Illumina [4]. However, it overlooks the security risks arising from compromises of computer devices directly connected to portable sequencers as illustrated in Fig. 1. While highly sensitive data, such as the human genome, has become easier to sequence, the networks connecting to these smaller devices and the hardware running basecalling can no longer implicitly be trusted, and doing so can deteriorate the confidentiality and integrity of the genomic data being processed.
  Here, we present new security and privacy threats of portable sequencing technology and recommendations to aid in ensuring sequencing data is kept private and secure. First, to prevent unauthorized access to sequencing devices, IP addresses should not be considered a sufficient authentication mechanism. Second, integrity checks are necessary for all data passed from the sequencer to external computers to avoid data manipulation. Finally, encryption should be considered as data is passed from the sequencer to such external computers to prevent eavesdropping on data as it is sent and stored. As devices and technology rapidly change, it becomes paramount to reevaluate security requirements alongside them or risk leaving some of our most sensitive data exposed.</description>

      <title>The IoT Breaches your Household Again</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their apparent simplicity, devices like smart light bulbs and electrical plugs are often perceived as exempt from rigorous security measures. However, this paper challenges this misconception, uncovering how vulnerabilities in these seemingly innocuous devices can expose users to significant risks. This paper extends the findings outlined in previous work, introducing a novel attack scenario. This new attack allows malicious actors to obtain sensitive credentials, including the victim's Tapo account email and password, as well as the SSID and password of her local network. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these findings can be replicated, either partially or fully, across other smart devices within the same IoT ecosystem, specifically those manufactured by Tp-Link. Our investigation focused on the Tp-Link Tapo range, encompassing smart bulbs (Tapo L530E, Tapo L510E V2, and Tapo L630), a smart plug (Tapo P100), and a smart camera (Tapo C200). Utilizing similar communication protocols, or slight variants thereof, we found that the Tapo L530E, Tapo L510E V2, and Tapo L630 are susceptible to complete exploitation of all attack scenarios, including the newly identified one. Conversely, the Tapo P100 and Tapo C200 exhibit vulnerabilities to only a subset of attack scenarios. In conclusion, by highlighting these vulnerabilities and their potential impact, we aim to raise awareness and encourage proactive steps towards mitigating security risks in smart device deployment.</description>

      <title>The Latency Price of Threshold Cryptosystem in Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold cryptography is essential for many blockchain protocols. For example, many protocols rely on threshold common coin to implement asynchronous consensus, leader elections, and provide support for randomized applications. Similarly, threshold signature schemes are frequently used for protocol efficiency and state certification, and threshold decryption and threshold time-lock puzzles are often necessary for privacy.
  In this paper, we study the interplay between threshold cryptography and a class of blockchains that use Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols with a focus on latency. More specifically, we focus on blockchain-native threshold cryptosystem, where the blockchain validators seek to run a threshold cryptographic protocol once for every block with the block contents as an input to the threshold cryptographic protocol. All existing approaches for blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems introduce a latency overhead of at least one message delay for running the threshold cryptographic protocol. In this paper, we first propose a mechanism to eliminate this overhead for blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems with tight thresholds, i.e., in threshold cryptographic protocols where the secrecy and reconstruction thresholds are the same. However, many real-world proof-of-stake-based blockchain-native threshold cryptosystems rely on ramp thresholds, where reconstruction thresholds are strictly greater than secrecy thresholds. For these blockchains, we formally demonstrate that the additional delay is unavoidable. We then introduce a mechanism to minimize this delay in the optimistic case. We implement our optimistic protocol for the proof-of-stake distributed randomness scheme on the Aptos blockchain. Our measurements from the Aptos mainnet show that the optimistic approach reduces latency overhead by 71%.</description>

      <title>L2AI: lightweight three-factor authentication and authorization in IOMT blockchain-based environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Internet of Things (IoMT) is the next frontier in the digital revolution and is utilized in healthcare. In this context, IoT enables individuals to remotely manage their essential activities with minimal interaction. However, the limitations of network resources and the challenges of establishing a secure channel, as well as sharing and collecting sensitive information through an insecure public channel, pose security challenges for the medical IoT. This paper presents a lightweight multi-factor authentication and anonymous user authentication scheme to access real-time data in a blockchain-based environment. The scheme utilizes an insecure channel called L2AI. L2AI ensures security and efficiency while enhancing user anonymity through the use of pseudo-identity and dynamic indexing. The proposed method supports highly scalable systems with an efficient user registration process, allowing authenticated users to access both existing and newly added system entities without additional processes. Although the scheme is primarily designed for large systems, such as health infrastructure, it is also suitable for resource-constrained devices. The scheme relies on one-way cryptographic hashing functions and bitwise XOR operations. Additionally, a fuzzy mining algorithm is employed on the user side to verify the user's biometric information. L2AI adopts the "Real-Or-Random (ROR)" model for security proof and employs BAN logic for proof of authenticity. Formal security verification is conducted using the "Automatic Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Programs" (Proverif) tool, complemented by informal security analysis demonstrating the proper functionality of L2AI.</description>

      <title>Turning Generative Models Degenerate: The Power of Data Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12281v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) trained by third parties raises significant security concerns. In particular, malicious actors can introduce backdoors through poisoning attacks to generate undesirable outputs. While such attacks have been extensively studied in image domains and classification tasks, they remain underexplored for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. To address this gap, we conduct an investigation of various poisoning techniques targeting the LLM's fine-tuning phase via prefix-tuning, a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method. We assess their effectiveness across two generative tasks: text summarization and text completion; and we also introduce new metrics to quantify the success and stealthiness of such NLG poisoning attacks. Through our experiments, we find that the prefix-tuning hyperparameters and trigger designs are the most crucial factors to influence attack success and stealthiness. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing popular defenses are ineffective against our poisoning attacks. Our study presents the first systematic approach to understanding poisoning attacks targeting NLG tasks during fine-tuning via PEFT across a wide range of triggers and attack settings. We hope our findings will aid the AI security community in developing effective defenses against such threats.</description>

      <title>WebAssembly and Security: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WebAssembly is revolutionizing the approach to developing modern applications. Although this technology was born to create portable and performant modules in web browsers, currently, its capabilities are extensively exploited in multiple and heterogeneous use-case scenarios. With the extensive effort of the community, new toolkits make the use of this technology more suitable for real-world applications. In this context, it is crucial to study the liaisons between the WebAssembly ecosystem and software security. Indeed, WebAssembly can be a medium for improving the security of a system, but it can also be exploited to evade detection systems or for performing cryptomining activities. In addition, programs developed in low-level languages such as C can be compiled in WebAssembly binaries, and it is interesting to evaluate the security impacts of executing programs vulnerable to attacks against memory in the WebAssembly sandboxed environment. Also, WebAssembly has been designed to provide a secure and isolated environment, but such capabilities should be assessed in order to analyze their weaknesses and propose new mechanisms for addressing them. Although some research works have provided surveys of the most relevant solutions aimed at discovering WebAssembly vulnerabilities or detecting attacks, at the time of writing, there is no comprehensive review of security-related literature in the WebAssembly ecosystem. We aim to fill this gap by proposing a comprehensive review of research works dealing with security in WebAssembly. We analyze 121 papers by identifying seven different security categories.
  We hope that our work will provide insights into the complex landscape of WebAssembly and guide researchers, developers, and security professionals towards novel avenues in the realm of the WebAssembly ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Cabin: Confining Untrusted Programs within Confidential VMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12334v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidential computing safeguards sensitive computations from untrusted clouds, with Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) providing a secure environment for guest OS. However, CVMs often come with large and vulnerable operating system kernels, making them susceptible to attacks exploiting kernel weaknesses. The imprecise control over the read/write access in the page table has allowed attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. The lack of security hierarchy leads to insufficient separation between untrusted applications and guest OS, making the kernel susceptible to direct threats from untrusted programs. This study proposes Cabin, an isolated execution framework within guest VM utilizing the latest AMD SEV-SNP technology. Cabin shields untrusted processes to the user space of a lower virtual machine privilege level (VMPL) by introducing a proxy-kernel between the confined processes and the guest OS. Furthermore, we propose execution protection mechanisms based on fine-gained control of VMPL privilege for vulnerable programs and the proxy-kernel to minimize the attack surface. We introduce asynchronous forwarding mechanism and anonymous memory management to reduce the performance impact. The evaluation results show that the Cabin framework incurs a modest overhead (5% on average) on Nbench and WolfSSL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>SENTAUR: Security EnhaNced Trojan Assessment Using LLMs Against Undesirable Revisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A globally distributed IC supply chain brings risks due to untrusted third parties. The risks span inadvertent use of hardware Trojan (HT), inserted Intellectual Property (3P-IP) or Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flows. HT can introduce stealthy HT behavior, prevent an IC work as intended, or leak sensitive data via side channels. To counter HTs, rapidly examining HT scenarios is a key requirement. While Trust-Hub benchmarks are a good starting point to assess defenses, they encompass a small subset of manually created HTs within the expanse of HT designs. Further, the HTs may disappear during synthesis. We propose a large language model (LLM) framework SENTAUR to generate a suite of legitimate HTs for a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design by learning its specifications, descriptions, and natural language descriptions of HT effects. Existing tools and benchmarks are limited; they need a learning period to construct an ML model to mimic the threat model and are difficult to reproduce. SENTAUR can swiftly produce HT instances by leveraging LLMs without any learning period and sanitizing the HTs facilitating their rapid assessment. Evaluation of SENTAUR involved generating effective, synthesizable, and practical HTs from TrustHub and elsewhere, investigating impacts of payloads/triggers at the RTL. While our evaluation focused on HT insertion, SENTAUR can generalize to automatically transform an RTL code to have defined functional modifications.</description>

      <title>An Efficient TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol with VC Certificate Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a step forward in the design and implementation of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake protocol that enables the use of Verifiable Credential (VC) while maintaining full compliance with RFC-8446 and preserving all the security features of TLS 1.3. The improvement over our previous work lies in the handshake design, which now only uses messages already defined for TLS 1.3. The design has an incredibly positive impact on the implementation, as we made minimal changes to the OpenSSL library and relied mostly on a novel external provider to handle VC and Decentralized IDentifier related operations. The experimental results prove the feasibility of the design and show comparable performance to the original solution based on PKI and X.509 certificates. These results pave the way for the adoption of Self-Sovereign Identity in large-scale IoT systems, with a clear benefit in terms of reducing the cost of identity management.</description>

      <title>A High-Speed Hardware Algorithm for Modulus Operation and its Application in Prime Number Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel high-speed hardware algorithm for the modulus operation for FPGA implementation. The proposed algorithm use only addition, subtraction, logical, and bit shift operations, avoiding the complexities and hardware costs associated with multiplication and division. It demonstrates consistent performance across operand sizes ranging from 32-bit to 2048-bit, addressing scalability challenges in cryptographic applications. Implemented in Verilog HDL and tested on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 family FPGA, the algorithm shows a predictable linear scaling of cycle count with bit length difference (BLD), described by the equation $y=2x+2$, where $y$ represents the cycle count and $x$ represents the BLD. The application of this algorithm in prime number calculation up to 500,000 shows its practical utility and performance advantages. Comprehensive evaluations reveal efficient resource utilization, robust timing performance, and effective power management, making it suitable for high-performance and resource-constrained platforms. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of modular arithmetic operations, with potential implications for cryptographic protocols and secure computing.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Unsafe Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) have demonstrated the capability to synthesize high-quality output. It is important to understand their potential to produce unsafe content, such as violent or terrifying videos. In this work, we provide a comprehensive understanding of unsafe video generation.
  First, to confirm the possibility that these models could indeed generate unsafe videos, we choose unsafe content generation prompts collected from 4chan and Lexica, and three open-source SOTA VGMs to generate unsafe videos. After filtering out duplicates and poorly generated content, we created an initial set of 2112 unsafe videos from an original pool of 5607 videos. Through clustering and thematic coding analysis of these generated videos, we identify 5 unsafe video categories: Distorted/Weird, Terrifying, Pornographic, Violent/Bloody, and Political. With IRB approval, we then recruit online participants to help label the generated videos. Based on the annotations submitted by 403 participants, we identified 937 unsafe videos from the initial video set. With the labeled information and the corresponding prompts, we created the first dataset of unsafe videos generated by VGMs.
  We then study possible defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of unsafe videos. Existing defense methods in image generation focus on filtering either input prompt or output results. We propose a new approach called Latent Variable Defense (LVD), which works within the model's internal sampling process. LVD can achieve 0.90 defense accuracy while reducing time and computing resources by 10x when sampling a large number of unsafe prompts.</description>

      <title>The revised boomerang connectivity tables and their connection to the Difference Distribution Table</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that functions over finite fields play a crucial role in designing substitution boxes (S-boxes) in modern block ciphers. In order to analyze the security of an S-box, recently, three new tables have been introduced: the Extended Boomerang Connectivity Table (EBCT), the Lower Boomerang Connectivity Table (LBCT), and the Upper Boomerang Connectivity Table (UBCT). In fact, these tables offer improved methods over the usual Boomerang Connectivity Table (BCT) for analyzing the security of S-boxes against boomerang-style attacks. Here, we put in context these new EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT concepts by connecting them to the DDT for a differentially $\delta$-uniform function and also determine the EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT entries of three classes of differentially $4$-uniform power permutations, namely, Gold, Kasami and Bracken-Leander. We also determine the Double Boomerang Connectivity Table (DBCT) entries of the Gold function. As byproducts of our approach, we obtain some previously published results quite easily.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Parallel Row-Layered Min-Sum MDPC Decoder for McEliece Cryptosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The medium-density parity-check (MDPC) code-based McEliece cryptosystem remains a finalist of the post-quantum cryptography standard. The Min-sum decoding algorithm achieves better performance-complexity tradeoff than other algorithms for MDPC codes. However, the prior Min-sum MDPC decoder requires large memories, whose complexity dominates the overall complexity. Besides, its actual achievable parallelism is limited. This paper has four contributions: For the first time, the row-layered scheduling scheme is exploited to substantially reduce the memory requirement of MDPC decoders; A low-complexity scheme is developed to mitigate the performance loss caused by finite precision representation of the messages and high column weights of MDPC codes in row-layered decoding; Constraints are added to the parity check matrix construction to enable effective parallel processing with negligible impacts on the decoder performance and resilience towards attacks; A novel parity check matrix division scheme for highly efficient parallel processing is proposed and the corresponding parallel row-layered decoder architecture is designed. The number of clock cycles for each decoding iteration is reduced by a factor of L using the proposed L-parallel decoder with very small memory overhead. For an example 2-parallel decoder, the proposed design leads to 26% less memory requirement and 70% latency reduction compared to the prior decoder.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Flexible Differet-Radix Montgomery Modular Multiplication for Hardware Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Montgomery modular multiplication is widely-used in public key cryptosystems (PKC) and affects the efficiency of upper systems directly. However, modulus is getting larger due to the increasing demand of security, which results in a heavy computing cost. High-performance implementation of Montgomery modular multiplication is urgently required to ensure the highly-efficient operations in PKC. However, existing high-speed implementations still need a large amount redundant computing to simplify the intermediate result. Supports to the redundant representation is extremely limited on Montgomery modular multiplication. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel variant of iterative Montgomery modular multiplication, called DRMMM, that allows the quotient can be computed in multiple iterations. In this variant, terms in intermediate result and the quotient in each iteration are computed in different radix such that computation of the quotient can be pipelined. Based on proposed variant, we also design high-performance hardware implementation architecture for faster operation. In the architecture, intermediate result in every iteration is denoted as three parts to free from redundant computations. Finally, to support FPGA-based systems, we design operators based on FPGA underlying architecture for better area-time performance. The result of implementation and experiment shows that our method reduces the output latency by 38.3\% than the fastest design on FPGA.</description>

      <title>Private prediction for large-scale synthetic text generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach for generating differentially private synthetic text using large language models (LLMs), via private prediction. In the private prediction framework, we only require the output synthetic data to satisfy differential privacy guarantees. This is in contrast to approaches that train a generative model on potentially sensitive user-supplied source data and seek to ensure the model itself is safe to release.
  We prompt a pretrained LLM with source data, but ensure that next-token predictions are made with differential privacy guarantees. Previous work in this paradigm reported generating a small number of examples (&lt;10) at reasonable privacy levels, an amount of data that is useful only for downstream in-context learning or prompting. In contrast, we make changes that allow us to generate thousands of high-quality synthetic data points, greatly expanding the set of potential applications. Our improvements come from an improved privacy analysis and a better private selection mechanism, which makes use of the equivalence between the softmax layer for sampling tokens in LLMs and the exponential mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a novel use of public predictions via the sparse vector technique, in which we do not pay privacy costs for tokens that are predictable without sensitive data; we find this to be particularly effective for structured data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), recently proposed as an alternative to the classical Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in the application for differentially private model training. Using the DP-SGD algorithm, we demonstrate that KAN can be made private in a straightforward manner and evaluated its performance across several datasets. Our results indicate that the accuracy of KAN is not only comparable with MLP but also experiences similar deterioration due to privacy constraints, making it suitable for differentially private model training.</description>

      <title>AgentPoison: Red-teaming LLM Agents via Poisoning Memory or Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, primarily due to their advanced capabilities in reasoning, utilizing external knowledge and tools, calling APIs, and executing actions to interact with environments. Current agents typically utilize a memory module or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, retrieving past knowledge and instances with similar embeddings from knowledge bases to inform task planning and execution. However, the reliance on unverified knowledge bases raises significant concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. To uncover such vulnerabilities, we propose a novel red teaming approach AgentPoison, the first backdoor attack targeting generic and RAG-based LLM agents by poisoning their long-term memory or RAG knowledge base. In particular, we form the trigger generation process as a constrained optimization to optimize backdoor triggers by mapping the triggered instances to a unique embedding space, so as to ensure that whenever a user instruction contains the optimized backdoor trigger, the malicious demonstrations are retrieved from the poisoned memory or knowledge base with high probability. In the meantime, benign instructions without the trigger will still maintain normal performance. Unlike conventional backdoor attacks, AgentPoison requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and the optimized backdoor trigger exhibits superior transferability, in-context coherence, and stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentPoison's effectiveness in attacking three types of real-world LLM agents: RAG-based autonomous driving agent, knowledge-intensive QA agent, and healthcare EHRAgent. On each agent, AgentPoison achieves an average attack success rate higher than 80% with minimal impact on benign performance (less than 1%) with a poison rate less than 0.1%.</description>

      <title>CatchBackdoor: Backdoor Detection via Critical Trojan Neural Path Fuzzing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications has benefited from abundant pre-trained models. However, the backdoored pre-trained models can pose a significant trojan threat to the deployment of downstream DNNs. Numerous backdoor detection methods have been proposed but are limited to two aspects: (1) high sensitivity on trigger size, especially on stealthy attacks (i.e., blending attacks and defense adaptive attacks); (2) rely heavily on benign examples for reverse engineering. To address these challenges, we empirically observed that trojaned behaviors triggered by various trojan attacks can be attributed to the trojan path, composed of top-$k$ critical neurons with more significant contributions to model prediction changes. Motivated by it, we propose CatchBackdoor, a detection method against trojan attacks. Based on the close connection between trojaned behaviors and trojan path to trigger errors, CatchBackdoor starts from the benign path and gradually approximates the trojan path through differential fuzzing. We then reverse triggers from the trojan path, to trigger errors caused by diverse trojaned attacks. Extensive experiments on MINST, CIFAR-10, and a-ImageNet datasets and 7 models (LeNet, ResNet, and VGG) demonstrate the superiority of CatchBackdoor over the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of (1) \emph{effective} - it shows better detection performance, especially on stealthy attacks ($\sim$ $\times$ 2 on average); (2) \emph{extensible} - it is robust to trigger size and can conduct detection without benign examples.</description>

Abstract: The improvements on quantum technology are threatening our daily cybersecurity, as a capable quantum computer can break all currently employed asymmetric cryptosystems. In preparation for the quantum-era the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated in 2016 a standardization process for public-key encryption (PKE) schemes, key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEM) and digital signature schemes. In 2023, NIST made an additional call for post-quantum signatures. With this chapter we aim at providing a survey on code-based cryptography, focusing on PKEs and signature schemes. We cover the main frameworks introduced in code-based cryptography and analyze their security assumptions. We provide the mathematical background in a lecture notes style, with the intention of reaching a wider audience.</description>

Abstract: In this age of digitalization, Internet services face more attacks than ever. An attacker's objective is to exploit systems and use them for malicious purposes. Such efforts are rising as vulnerable systems can be discovered and compromised through Internet-wide scanning. One known methodology besides traditional security leverages is to learn from those who attack it. A honeypot helps to collect information about an attacker by pretending to be a vulnerable target. Thus, how honeypots can contribute to a more secure infrastructure makes an interesting topic of research. This thesis will present a honeypot solution to investigate malicious activities in heiCLOUD and show that attacks have increased significantly. To detect attackers in restricted network zones at Heidelberg University, a new concept to discover leaks in the firewall will be created. Furthermore, to consider an attacker's point of view, a method for detecting honeypots at the transport level will be introduced. Lastly, a customized OpenSSH server that works as an intermediary instance will be presented to mitigate these efforts.</description>

      <title>SSL-Cleanse: Trojan Detection and Mitigation in Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a prevalent approach for encoding data representations. Using a pre-trained SSL image encoder and subsequently training a downstream classifier, impressive performance can be achieved on various tasks with very little labeled data. The growing adoption of SSL has led to an increase in security research on SSL encoders and associated Trojan attacks. Trojan attacks embedded in SSL encoders can operate covertly, spreading across multiple users and devices. The presence of backdoor behavior in Trojaned encoders can inadvertently be inherited by downstream classifiers, making it even more difficult to detect and mitigate the threat. Although current Trojan detection methods in supervised learning can potentially safeguard SSL downstream classifiers, identifying and addressing triggers in the SSL encoder before its widespread dissemination is a challenging task. This challenge arises because downstream tasks might be unknown, dataset labels may be unavailable, and the original unlabeled training dataset might be inaccessible during Trojan detection in SSL encoders. We introduce SSL-Cleanse as a solution to identify and mitigate backdoor threats in SSL encoders. We evaluated SSL-Cleanse on various datasets using 1200 encoders, achieving an average detection success rate of 82.2% on ImageNet-100. After mitigating backdoors, on average, backdoored encoders achieve 0.3% attack success rate without great accuracy loss, proving the effectiveness of SSL-Cleanse. The source code of SSL-Cleanse is available at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/SSL-Cleanse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we reexamine the vulnerability of Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) to bribing attacks, where an adversary incentivizes blockchain miners to deliberately ignore a specific transaction to undermine the punishment mechanism of PCNs. While previous studies have posited a prohibitive cost for such attacks, we show that this cost may be dramatically reduced (to approximately \$125), thereby increasing the likelihood of these attacks. To this end, we introduce Bribe &amp; Fork, a modified bribing attack that leverages the threat of a so-called feather fork which we analyze with a novel formal model for the mining game with forking. We empirically analyze historical data of some real-world blockchain implementations to evaluate the scale of this cost reduction. Our findings shed more light on the potential vulnerability of PCNs and highlight the need for robust solutions.</description>

      <title>Robust-Wide: Robust Watermarking against Instruction-driven Image Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing allows users to quickly edit an image according to text instructions in a forward pass. Nevertheless, malicious users can easily exploit this technique to create fake images, which could cause a crisis of trust and harm the rights of the original image owners. Watermarking is a common solution to trace such malicious behavior. Unfortunately, instruction-driven image editing can significantly change the watermarked image at the semantic level, making current state-of-the-art watermarking methods ineffective. To remedy it, we propose Robust-Wide, the first robust watermarking methodology against instruction-driven image editing. Specifically, we follow the classic structure of deep robust watermarking, consisting of the encoder, noise layer, and decoder. To achieve robustness against semantic distortions, we introduce a novel Partial Instruction-driven Denoising Sampling Guidance (PIDSG) module, which consists of a large variety of instruction injections and substantial modifications of images at different semantic levels. With PIDSG, the encoder tends to embed the watermark into more robust and semantic-aware areas, which remains in existence even after severe image editing. Experiments demonstrate that Robust-Wide can effectively extract the watermark from the edited image with a low bit error rate of nearly 2.6% for 64-bit watermark messages. Meanwhile, it only induces a neglectable influence on the visual quality and editability of the original images. Moreover, Robust-Wide holds general robustness against different sampling configurations and other popular image editing methods such as ControlNet-InstructPix2Pix, MagicBrush, Inpainting, and DDIM Inversion. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/hurunyi/Robust-Wide.</description>

      <title>BISON: Blind Identification with Stateless scOped pseudoNyms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delegating authentication to identity providers like Google or Facebook, while convenient, compromises user privacy. These identity providers can record users' every move; the global identifiers they provide also enable internet-wide tracking.
  We show that neither is a necessary evil by presenting the BISON pseudonym derivation protocol, inspired by Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions. It hides the service provider's identity from the identity provider yet produces a trusted, scoped, immutable pseudonym. Colluding service providers cannot link BISON pseudonyms; this prevents user tracking. BISON does not require a long-lived state on the user device and does not add additional actors to the authentication process.
  BISON is practical. It is easy to understand, implement, and reason about, and is designed to integrate into existing authentication protocols. To demonstrate this, we provide an OpenID Connect extension that allows OIDC's PPID pseudonyms to be derived using BISON. Additionally, BISON uses lightweight cryptography. Pseudonym derivation requires a total of four elliptic curve scalar-point multiplications and four hash function evaluations, taking ~3 ms in our proof of concept implementation. Thus, BISON's privacy guarantees can be realized in practice.
  This makes BISON a crucial stepping stone towards the privacy-preserving internet of tomorrow.</description>

      <title>KESIC: Kerberos Extensions for Smart, IoT and CPS Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure and efficient multi-user access mechanisms are increasingly important for the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being used today.
  Kerberos is a well-known and time-tried security authentication and access control system for distributed systems wherein many users securely access various distributed services. Traditionally, these services are software applications or devices, such as printers. However, Kerberos is not directly suitable for IoT devices due to its relatively heavy-weight protocols and the resource-constrained nature of the devices.
  This paper presents KESIC, a system that enables efficient and secure multi-user access for IoT devices. KESIC aims to facilitate mutual authentication of IoT devices and users via Kerberos without modifying the latter's protocols. To facilitate that, KESIC includes a special Kerberized service, called IoT Server, that manages access to IoT devices. KESIC presents two protocols for secure and comprehensive multi-user access system for two types of IoT devices: general and severely power constrained. In terms of performance, KESIC onsumes $\approx~47$ times less memory, and incurs $\approx~135$ times lower run-time overhead than Kerberos.</description>

      <title>UEFI Vulnerability Signature Generation using Static and Symbolic Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since its major release in 2006, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) has become the industry standard for interfacing a computer's hardware and operating system, replacing BIOS. UEFI has higher privileged security access to system resources than any other software component, including the system kernel. Hence, identifying and characterizing vulnerabilities in UEFI is extremely important for computer security. However, automated detection and characterization of UEFI vulnerabilities is a challenging problem. Static vulnerability analysis techniques are scalable but lack precision (reporting many false positives), whereas symbolic analysis techniques are precise but are hampered by scalability issues due to path explosion and the cost of constraint solving. In this paper, we introduce a technique called STatic Analysis guided Symbolic Execution (STASE), which integrates both analysis approaches to leverage their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. We begin with a rule-based static vulnerability analysis on LLVM bitcode to identify potential vulnerability targets for symbolic execution. We then focus symbolic execution on each target to achieve precise vulnerability detection and signature generation. STASE relies on the manual specification of reusable vulnerability rules and attacker-controlled inputs. However, it automates the generation of harnesses that guide the symbolic execution process, addressing the usability and scalability of symbolic execution, which typically requires manual harness generation to reduce the state space. We implemented and applied STASE to the implementations of UEFI code base. STASE detects and generates vulnerability signatures for 5 out of 9 recently reported PixieFail vulnerabilities and 13 new vulnerabilities in Tianocore's EDKII codebase.</description>

Abstract: This study sheds light on the imperative need to bolster safety and privacy measures in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, by identifying and mitigating their vulnerabilities through explainable analysis of prompt attacks. We propose Counterfactual Explainable Incremental Prompt Attack (CEIPA), a novel technique where we guide prompts in a specific manner to quantitatively measure attack effectiveness and explore the embedded defense mechanisms in these models. Our approach is distinctive for its capacity to elucidate the reasons behind the generation of harmful responses by LLMs through an incremental counterfactual methodology. By organizing the prompt modification process into four incremental levels: (word, sentence, character, and a combination of character and word) we facilitate a thorough examination of the susceptibilities inherent to LLMs. The findings from our study not only provide counterfactual explanation insight but also demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the effectiveness of attack prompts.</description>

      <title>Security Matrix for Multimodal Agents on Mobile Devices: A Systematic and Proof of Concept Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress in the reasoning capability of the Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has triggered the development of autonomous agent systems on mobile devices. MLLM-based mobile agent systems consist of perception, reasoning, memory, and multi-agent collaboration modules, enabling automatic analysis of user instructions and the design of task pipelines with only natural language and device screenshots as inputs. Despite the increased human-machine interaction efficiency, the security risks of MLLM-based mobile agent systems have not been systematically studied. Existing security benchmarks for agents mainly focus on Web scenarios, and the attack techniques against MLLMs are also limited in the mobile agent scenario. To close these gaps, this paper proposes a mobile agent security matrix covering 3 functional modules of the agent systems. Based on the security matrix, this paper proposes 4 realistic attack paths and verifies these attack paths through 8 attack methods. By analyzing the attack results, this paper reveals that MLLM-based mobile agent systems are not only vulnerable to multiple traditional attacks, but also raise new security concerns previously unconsidered. This paper highlights the need for security awareness in the design of MLLM-based systems and paves the way for future research on attacks and defense methods.</description>

      <title>GROOT: Generating Robust Watermark for Diffusion-Model-Based Audio Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amid the burgeoning development of generative models like diffusion models, the task of differentiating synthesized audio from its natural counterpart grows more daunting. Deepfake detection offers a viable solution to combat this challenge. Yet, this defensive measure unintentionally fuels the continued refinement of generative models. Watermarking emerges as a proactive and sustainable tactic, preemptively regulating the creation and dissemination of synthesized content. Thus, this paper, as a pioneer, proposes the generative robust audio watermarking method (Groot), presenting a paradigm for proactively supervising the synthesized audio and its source diffusion models. In this paradigm, the processes of watermark generation and audio synthesis occur simultaneously, facilitated by parameter-fixed diffusion models equipped with a dedicated encoder. The watermark embedded within the audio can subsequently be retrieved by a lightweight decoder. The experimental results highlight Groot's outstanding performance, particularly in terms of robustness, surpassing that of the leading state-of-the-art methods. Beyond its impressive resilience against individual post-processing attacks, Groot exhibits exceptional robustness when facing compound attacks, maintaining an average watermark extraction accuracy of around 95%.</description>

Abstract: Amid growing concerns over the ease of theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for fingerprinting models has increased. Fingerprinting, in this context, means that the model owner can link a given model to their original version, thereby identifying if their model is being misused or has been completely stolen. In this paper, we first define a set five properties a successful fingerprint should satisfy; namely, the fingerprint should be Transparent, Efficient, Persistent, Robust, and Unforgeable. Next, we propose Chain &amp; Hash, a new, simple fingerprinting approach that implements a fingerprint with a cryptographic flavor, achieving all these properties. Chain &amp; Hash involves generating a set of questions (the fingerprints) along with a set of potential answers. These elements are hashed together using a secure hashing technique to select the value for each question, hence providing an unforgeability property-preventing adversaries from claiming false ownership. We evaluate the Chain &amp; Hash technique on multiple models and demonstrate its robustness against benign transformations, such as fine-tuning on different datasets, and adversarial attempts to erase the fingerprint. Finally, our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of implementing Chain &amp; Hash and its utility, where fingerprinted models achieve almost the same performance as non-fingerprinted ones across different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Building Intelligence Identification System via Large Language Model Watermarking: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into diverse industries, posing substantial security risks due to unauthorized replication and misuse. To mitigate these concerns, robust identification mechanisms are widely acknowledged as an effective strategy. Identification systems for LLMs now rely heavily on watermarking technology to manage and protect intellectual property and ensure data security. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on the basic principles of algorithms and lacked a comprehensive analysis of watermarking theory and practice from the perspective of intelligent identification. To bridge this gap, firstly, we explore how a robust identity recognition system can be effectively implemented and managed within LLMs by various participants using watermarking technology. Secondly, we propose a mathematical framework based on mutual information theory, which systematizes the identification process to achieve more precise and customized watermarking. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of performance metrics for LLM watermarking, reflecting participant preferences and advancing discussions on its identification applications. Lastly, we outline the existing challenges in current watermarking technologies and theoretical frameworks, and provide directional guidance to address these challenges. Our systematic classification and detailed exposition aim to enhance the comparison and evaluation of various methods, fostering further research and development toward a transparent, secure, and equitable LLM ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Position: Considerations for Differentially Private Learning with Large-Scale Public Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of differentially private machine learning can be boosted significantly by leveraging the transfer learning capabilities of non-private models pretrained on large public datasets. We critically review this approach.
  We primarily question whether the use of large Web-scraped datasets should be viewed as differential-privacy-preserving. We caution that publicizing these models pretrained on Web data as "private" could lead to harm and erode the public's trust in differential privacy as a meaningful definition of privacy.
  Beyond the privacy considerations of using public data, we further question the utility of this paradigm. We scrutinize whether existing machine learning benchmarks are appropriate for measuring the ability of pretrained models to generalize to sensitive domains, which may be poorly represented in public Web data. Finally, we notice that pretraining has been especially impactful for the largest available models -- models sufficiently large to prohibit end users running them on their own devices. Thus, deploying such models today could be a net loss for privacy, as it would require (private) data to be outsourced to a more compute-powerful third party.
  We conclude by discussing potential paths forward for the field of private learning, as public pretraining becomes more popular and powerful.</description>

      <title>Investigating Adversarial Vulnerability and Implicit Bias through Frequency Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performance in classification tasks, neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, subtle perturbations of the input data designed to deceive the model. In this work, we investigate the relation between these perturbations and the implicit bias of neural networks trained with gradient-based algorithms. To this end, we analyse the network's implicit bias through the lens of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we identify the minimal and most critical frequencies necessary for accurate classification or misclassification respectively for each input image and its adversarially perturbed version, and uncover the correlation among those. To this end, among other methods, we use a newly introduced technique capable of detecting non-linear correlations between high-dimensional datasets. Our results provide empirical evidence that the network bias in Fourier space and the target frequencies of adversarial attacks are highly correlated and suggest new potential strategies for adversarial defence.</description>

      <title>DIFFender: Diffusion-Based Adversarial Defense against Patch Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09124v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks, particularly patch attacks, pose significant threats to the robustness and reliability of deep learning models. Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks is crucial for real-world applications. This paper introduces DIFFender, a novel defense framework that harnesses the capabilities of a text-guided diffusion model to combat patch attacks. Central to our approach is the discovery of the Adversarial Anomaly Perception (AAP) phenomenon, which empowers the diffusion model to detect and localize adversarial patches through the analysis of distributional discrepancies. DIFFender integrates dual tasks of patch localization and restoration within a single diffusion model framework, utilizing their close interaction to enhance defense efficacy. Moreover, DIFFender utilizes vision-language pre-training coupled with an efficient few-shot prompt-tuning algorithm, which streamlines the adaptation of the pre-trained diffusion model to defense tasks, thus eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Our comprehensive evaluation spans image classification and face recognition tasks, extending to real-world scenarios, where DIFFender shows good robustness against adversarial attacks. The versatility and generalizability of DIFFender are evident across a variety of settings, classifiers, and attack methodologies, marking an advancement in adversarial patch defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bias in Text-to-Image Generation with Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of Text-to-Image (T2I) models in content generation requires careful examination of their safety, including their robustness to adversarial attacks. Despite extensive research on adversarial attacks, the reasons for their effectiveness remain underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study on adversarial attacks against T2I models, focusing on analyzing factors associated with attack success rates (ASR). We introduce a new attack objective - entity swapping using adversarial suffixes and two gradient-based attack algorithms. Human and automatic evaluations reveal the asymmetric nature of ASRs on entity swap: for example, it is easier to replace "human" with "robot" in the prompt "a human dancing in the rain." with an adversarial suffix, but the reverse replacement is significantly harder. We further propose probing metrics to establish indicative signals from the model's beliefs to the adversarial ASR. We identify conditions that result in a success probability of 60% for adversarial attacks and others where this likelihood drops below 5%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure multiparty computation (MPC) schemes allow two or more parties to conjointly compute a function on their private input sets while revealing nothing but the output. Existing state-of-the-art number-theoretic-based designs face the threat of attacks through quantum algorithms. In this context, we present secure MPC protocols that can withstand quantum attacks. We first present the design and analysis of an information-theoretic secure oblivious linear evaluation (OLE), namely ${\sf qOLE}$ in the quantum domain, and show that our ${\sf qOLE}$ is safe from external attacks. In addition, our scheme satisfies all the security requirements of a secure OLE. We further utilize ${\sf qOLE}$ as a building block to construct a quantum-safe multiparty private set intersection (MPSI) protocol.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words: On Large Language Models Actionability in Mission-Critical Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks.
  Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in risk analysis. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis.
  Method. We manually curated 193 unique scenarios leading to 1283 representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned counterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and three other human experts to review the models and the former human experts' analysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses.
  Results and Conclusions. Human experts demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks and complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on specific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and base models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can leverage LLMs as an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a condensed timeframe. They can also save costs by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Investigating and Defending Shortcut Learning in Personalized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized diffusion models have gained popularity for adapting pre-trained text-to-image models to generate images of specific topics with minimal training data. However, these models are vulnerable to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to degraded performance on corrupted datasets. Such vulnerabilities are further exploited to craft protective perturbations on sensitive images like portraits that prevent unauthorized generation. In response, diffusion-based purification methods have been proposed to remove these perturbations and retain generation performance. However, existing works turn to over-purifying the images, which causes information loss. In this paper, we take a closer look at the fine-tuning process of personalized diffusion models through the lens of shortcut learning. And we propose a hypothesis explaining the manipulation mechanisms of existing perturbation methods, demonstrating that perturbed images significantly deviate from their original prompts in the CLIP-based latent space. This misalignment during fine-tuning causes models to associate noisy patterns with identifiers, resulting in performance degradation. Based on these insights, we introduce a systematic approach to maintain training performance through purification. Our method first purifies the images to realign them with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive learning with negative tokens to decouple the learning of clean identities from noisy patterns, which shows a strong potential capacity against adaptive perturbation. Our study uncovers shortcut learning vulnerabilities in personalized diffusion models and provides a firm evaluation framework for future protective perturbation research.

      <title>Backdoor Graph Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, graph condensation has emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on a large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), the security issues of graph condensation have not been studied. To bridge this research gap, we propose the task of backdoor graph condensation. While graph backdoor attacks have been extensively explored, applying existing graph backdoor methods for graph condensation is not practical since they can undermine the model utility and yield low attack success rate.
  To alleviate these issues, we introduce two primary objectives for backdoor attacks against graph condensation: 1) the injection of triggers cannot affect the quality of condensed graphs, maintaining the utility of GNNs trained on them; and 2) the effectiveness of triggers should be preserved throughout the condensation process, achieving high attack success rate. To pursue the objectives, we devise the first backdoor attack against graph condensation, denoted as BGC. Specifically, we inject triggers during condensation and iteratively update the triggers to ensure effective attacks. Further, we propose a poisoned node selection module to minimize the influence of triggers on condensed graphs' quality. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results demonstrate our method's resilience against multiple defense methods. Finally, we conduct comprehensive studies to analyze the factors that influence the attack performance.</description>
