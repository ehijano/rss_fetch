      <title>Tensionless AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and Single Trace $T\overline{T}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the few cases of AdS/CFT where both sides of the duality are under good control relates tensionless $k=1$ strings on AdS$_3$ to a two-dimensional symmetric product CFT. Building on prior observations, we propose an exact duality between string theory on a spacetime which is not asymptotically AdS and a non-conformal field theory. The bulk theory is constructed as a marginal deformation of the $k=1$ AdS$_3$ string while the spacetime dual is a single trace $T\overline{T}$-deformed symmetric orbifold theory. As evidence for the duality, we match the one-loop bulk and boundary torus partition functions. This correspondence provides a framework to both learn about quantum gravity beyond AdS and understand how to define physical observables in $T\overline{T}$-deformed field theories.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purification maps a mixed state to a pure state and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We link the operator complexity of the density matrix to the state/operator complexity of purified states using three purification schemes: time-independent, time-dependent, and instantaneous purification. We propose inequalities among the operator and state complexities of mixed states and their purifications, demonstrated with a single qubit, two-qubit Werner states, and infinite-dimensional diagonal mixed states. We find that the complexity of a vacuum evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles created between left and right Rindler wedges. Finally, for the thermofield double state evolving from zero to finite temperature, we show that 1) the state complexity follows the Lloyd bound, and 2) the Krylov state/operator complexities are subadditive in contrast to the holographic volume complexity.</description>

      <title>Attractors, Geodesics, and the Geometry of Moduli Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We connect recent conjectures and observations pertaining to geodesics, attractor flows, Laplacian eigenvalues and the geometry of moduli spaces by using that attractor flows are geodesics. For toroidal compactifications, attractor points are related to (degenerate) masses of the Laplacian on the target space, and also to the Laplacian on the moduli space. We also explore compactifications of M-Theory to $5$D on a Calabi-Yau threefold and argue that geodesics are unique in a special set of classes, providing further evidence for a recent conjecture by Raman and Vafa. Finally, we describe the role of the marked moduli space in $4$d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ compactifications. We study split attractor flows in an explicit example of the one-parameter family of quintics and discuss setups where flops to isomorphic Calabi-Yau manifolds exist.</description>

      <title>Notes on Characterizations of 2d Rational SCFTs: Algebraicity, Mirror Symmetry and Complex Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes combine results from two papers by the present authors viz., Part I (arXiv:2205.10299) and Part II (arXiv:2212.13028) into one streamlined version for better readability, along with a review on theory of complex multiplication for non-singular complex projective varieties and complex tori that is aimed at string theorists. We think that it is worth posting this edition as a separate entry in arXiv for those reasons, although this edition contains no essential progress beyond Part I and Part II.
  S. Gukov and C. Vafa proposed a characterization of rational N=(1,1) superconformal field theories (SCFTs) on 1+1 dimensions with Ricci-flat Kahler target spaces in terms of the Hodge structure of the target space, extending an earlier observation by G. Moore. We refined this idea and obtained a conjectural statement on necessary and sufficient conditions for such SCFTs to be rational, which we indeed prove to be true in the case the target space is T^4. In the refined statement, the algebraicity of the geometric data of the target space turns out to be essential, and the Strominger--Yau--Zaslow fibration in the mirror correspondence also plays a vital role.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Bosonic and Fermionic One-Form Symmetries in $2+1$d and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the fundamental role that bosonic and fermionic symmetries play in physics, we study (non-invertible) one-form symmetries in $2 + 1$d consisting of topological lines with bosonic and fermionic self-statistics. We refer to these lines as Bose-Fermi-Braided (BFB) symmetries and argue that they can be classified. Unlike the case of generic anyonic lines, BFB symmetries are closely related to groups. In particular, when BFB lines are non-invertible, they are non-intrinsically non-invertible. Moreover, BFB symmetries are, in a categorical sense, weakly group theoretical. Using this understanding, we study invariants of renormalization group flows involving non-topological QFTs with BFB symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the localized and delocalized modes in kink-antikink interactions: a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study deals with a piecewise $\phi^2$ scalar field theory in $(1+1)$ dimensions. The scalar field potential is designed with a triple-well shape, engendering kink solutions with asymmetric square-well linearized potentials. Thus, the localized and delocalized modes in this model can be obtained analytically in terms of transcendental equations. This allows us to explore kink-antikink and antikink-kink collisions with any desired number of localized and delocalized modes. We obtain new scenarios of resonance windows suppression, shedding light on the role of higher excited modes in kink scattering.</description>

      <title>Three cases of complex eigenvalue/vector distributions of symmetric order-three random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random tensor models have applications in a variety of fields, such as quantum gravity, quantum information theory, mathematics of modern technologies, etc., and studying their statistical properties, e.g., tensor eigenvalue/vector distributions, are interesting and useful. Recently some tensor eigenvalue/vector distributions have been computed by expressing them as partition functions of zero-dimensional quantum field theories. In this paper, using the method, we compute three cases of complex eigenvalue/vector distributions of symmetric order-three random tensors, where the three cases can be characterized by the Lie-group invariances, $O(N,\mathbb{R})$, $O(N,\mathbb{C})$, and $U(N,\mathbb{C})$, respectively. Exact closed-form expressions of the distributions are obtained by computing partition functions of four-fermi theories, where the last case is of the "signed" distribution which counts the distribution with a sign factor coming from a Hessian matrix. As an application, we compute the injective norm of the complex symmetric order-three random tensor in the large-$N$ limit by computing the edge of the last signed distribution, obtaining agreement with a former numerical result in the literature.</description>

      <title>Topological Casimir effect in models with helical compact dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the helical compactification of spatial dimension on the local properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter. A general background geometry is considered with rotational symmetry in the subspace with the coordinates appearing in the helical periodicity condition. It is shown that by a coordinate transformation the problem is reduced to the problem with standard quasiperiodicity condition in the same local geometry and with the effective compactification radius determined by the length of the compact dimension and the helicity parameter. As an application of the general procedure we have considered locally de Sitter spacetime with a helical compact dimension. By using the Hadamard function for the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, the vacuum expectation values of the field squared, current density, and energy-momentum tensor are studied. The topological contributions are explicitly separated and their asymptotics are described at early and late stages of cosmological expansion. An important difference, compared to the problem with quasiperiodic conditions, is the appearance of the nonzero off-diagonal component of the energy-momentum tensor and of the component of the current density along the uncompact dimension.</description>

      <title>TBA equations and quantum periods for D-type Argyres-Douglas theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct TBA equations for D-type Argyres-Douglas theories with an SU(2) flavor symmetry based on their spectral networks. We show that the solutions of these TBA equations agree with the quantum periods of the corresponding quantum Seiberg-Witten curves defined in the Nekrosov-Shatashvili limit of the Omega background, including a centrifugal correction. We study the variety of TBA systems across the Coulomb branch moduli space and find that they correspond to the Dynkin diagrams of $D_n$ Lie algebras in the minimal chamber, and reproduce the TBA equations for reflectionless D scattering theories at the maximally symmetric point. Numerical computations demonstrate that the quantum periods obtained from the Borel-Pad\'e resummation and their WKB expansions are in agreement with the solutions of the TBA equations.</description>

      <title>Charged Rotating BTZ Black Hole In The Non-Extensive Generalizations of Gibbs Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and thermodynamic geometry of the (2+1) dimensional charged rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli(CR-BTZ) black hole within the framework of non-extensive generalizations of Gibbs entropy. We write down the Bekenstein-Hawking(BH) entropy of the black hole in terms of the non-extensive entropies namely: Kaniadakis entropy, Renyi entropy, Sharma-Mittal entropy, Tsallis-Cirto and Barrow entropy. We investigate their impact on the thermodynamic phase structure and geometry of the CR-BTZ black hole in four different ensembles namely: the fixed $(J,Q)$ ensemble, fixed $(\Omega,\Phi)$ ensemble, fixed $(J,\Phi)$ ensemble and the fixed $(\Omega,Q)$ ensemble where $ J, Q, \Omega$ and $ \Phi$ represent the angular momentum, electric charge, angular velocity and electric potential of the CR-BTZ black hole respectively. We investigate the Ruppeiner and geometrothermodynamic(GTD) geometries of the black hole for all the non-extensive entropy cases. We find that there are Davies type phase transitions in the CR-BTZ black hole for the Kaniadakis entropy case for all the above mentioned thermodynamic ensembles. These Davies type phase transitions were not seen in the BH entropy case. We also find that the Ruppeiner and the GTD scalar for the Kaniadakis entropy show curvature singularities corresponding to these Davies type phase transitions in the CR-BTZ black hole.</description>

      <title>Type II orientifold flux vacua in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of type II orientifold flux vacua in three dimensions including gauge and metric fluxes, O-planes and D-branes. We derive simple flux models (we dub them RSTU-models) that admit a description in terms of gauged supergravities with half-maximal $\,\mathcal{N}=8\,$ supersymmetry in three dimensions. As a landscape appetizer, we present various multi-parametric families of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric AdS$_{3}$ and Mkw$_{3}$ vacua. Remarkably, negative masses turn out to be always absent in the spectrum of scalar fluctuations, thus making all the vacua perturbatively stable within half-maximal supergravity. We provide examples of non-supersymmetric type IIB AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua which feature parametrically-controlled scale separation and come along with integer-valued conformal dimensions of the would-be dual CFT$_{2}$ operators. We also comment on the implications of our results in light of the Swampland Program.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Composite Operators in the $\phi^4$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit.</description>

      <title>Holographic duals of symmetry broken phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel interpretation of Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) as theories of gravity, proposing a holographic duality where the bulk SymTFT (with the gauging of a suitable Lagrangian algebra) is dual to the universal effective field theory (EFT) that describes spontaneous symmetry breaking on the boundary. We test this conjecture in various dimensions and with many examples involving different continuous symmetry structures, including non-Abelian and non-invertible symmetries, as well as higher groups. For instance, we find that many Abelian SymTFTs are dual to free theories of Goldstone bosons or generalized Maxwell fields, while non-Abelian SymTFTs relate to non-linear sigma models with target spaces defined by the symmetry groups. We also extend our analysis to include the non-invertible $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ axial symmetry, finding it to be dual to axion-Maxwell theory, and a non-Abelian 2-group structure in four dimensions, deriving a new parity-violating interaction that has implications for the low-energy dynamics of U(N) QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive areal inequalities for five types of attractive gravity probe surfaces, which were proposed by us in order to characterize the strength of gravity in different ways including weak gravity region, taking into account of contributions of electric and magnetic charges, angular momentum, gravitational waves, and matters. These inequalities are generalizations of the Riemannian Penrose inequality for minimal surfaces, and lead to the concept of extremality for a given surface whose condition is given in terms of the gravitational mass and the electromagnetic charges. This means that the extremality is a characteristic property not only of black hole horizons or minimal surfaces but also of surfaces in weak gravity region. We also derive areal inequalities and extremality conditions for surfaces in asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considerations of high energies in quantum field theories on smooth manifolds have led to generalized uncertainty principles and the possibility of a physical minimal length in quantum gravitational scenarios. In these models, the minimal length would be a physical limit, not just a mathematical tool, and should be Lorentz invariant. In this paper, we study two-qubit communication and entanglement harvesting in a field subject to a covariant bandlimit (minimum length) and present the changes induced by this bandlimit. We find the bandlimit introduces nonlocality and acausal communication in a manner unlike non-covariant bandlimits or other quantum optical approximations. We also observe that this covariant bandlimit introduces uncertainties in time and temporal ordering with the unusual behavior attributed to the behavior of virtual particles being modified by the covariant cutoff.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a fully metallic and air-filled geodesic waveguide can be employed as an analog electromagnetic model of a static and spherically symmetric gravitational field. By following the Plebanski formalism, a space-time metric of the aforementioned type is firstly encoded into the electromagnetic properties of a flat space-time region in the form of an isotropic and radially varying refractive index distribution. Then, a three-dimensional, air-filled, and axially symmetric waveguide, composed of two equally spaced and curved metallic surfaces, is employed. Its shape is tailored such that the effective paths, followed by transverse electromagnetic beams of microwave radiation within this waveguide, result equivalent to null-geodesics taking place in the aforementioned refractive medium. This strategy avoids the need for a refractive medium, although it only allows to reproduce the space-time metric on the invariant plane. Two analog electromagnetic models of gravity, using the proposed approach, are designed to reproduce the metric of both a Schwarzschild black hole and a Morris-Thorne wormhole. The results from full-wave simulations demonstrate that a one-dimensional Gaussian beam faithfully follows a path completely equivalent to general relativistic null geodesics with a mean relative error within 4%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to constructing gravitational instantons based on the observation that the gravitational action of general relativity in its teleparallel formulation can be expressed as a product of torsion and excitation forms. We introduce a new class of solutions where these two forms are equal, which we term the self-excited instantons, and advocate for their use over the self-dual instantons of Eguchi and Hanson. These new self-excited instantons exhibit striking similarities to BPST instantons in Yang-Mills theory, as their action reduces to a topological Nieh-Yan term, which allows us to identify the axial torsion as a topological current and to define a topological charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the electromagnetic form factors ratio in the Rosenbluth and polarization methods. We explore the impact of adding new particles as the mediators in the electron-proton scattering on these ratios. Consequently, we find some bound on the scalar coupling as $\alpha_{sc}\sim 10^{-5}$ for $m_{sc}\sim 5 MeV-2 GeV$ and $\alpha_{sc}\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for $m_{sc}\sim 2-10 GeV$. Meanwhile, the vector coupling is bounded as $\alpha_v\sim 10^{-5}$ for $m_v\sim 5 MeV-1.1 GeV$ and $\alpha_v\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for $m_v\sim 1.2-10 GeV$. These constraints are in complete agreement with those which is found from other independent experiments.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement entropy has emerged as a novel tool for probing nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phenomena, such as color confinement in protons. While recent studies have demonstrated its significant capability in describing hadron production in deep inelastic scatterings, the QCD evolution of entanglement entropy remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the differential rapidity-dependent entanglement entropy within the proton and its connection to final-state hadrons, aiming to elucidate its QCD evolution. Our analysis reveals a strong agreement between the rapidity dependence of von Neumann entropy, obtained from QCD evolution equations, and the corresponding experimental data on hadron entropy. These findings provide compelling evidence for the emergence of a maximally entangled state, offering new insights into the nonperturbative structure of protons.</description>

      <title>Linear response in planar Hall and thermal Hall setups for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall setups, where we subject a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and a weak (i.e., non-quantizing) magnetic field $\mathbf B $. For computing the in-plane transport components, we have added an elastic deformation which gives rise to a chirality-dependent effective magnetic field $ \mathbf B^{\text{tot}} = \mathbf B + \chi \, \mathbf B_5 $, where $\chi $ is the chirality of an RSW node. We have included the effects of orbital magnetic moment (OMM), in conjunction with the Berry curvature (BC), both of which appear as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the bandstructure. Due to the presence of four bands, RSW semimetals provide a richer structure for obtaining the linear-response coefficients, compared to the Weyl semimetals. In particular, we have found that the OMM-contributed terms may oppose or add up to the BC-only parts, depending on which band we are considering. We have also considered the response arising from internode scatterings. Last, but not the least, we have determined the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, whose nature corroborates the findings of some recent experimental results.</description>

Abstract: Topological defect lines (TDLs) are extended line operators which act on the Hilbert space of two-dimensional CFTs and satisfy non-trivial fusion algebras when forming junctions. Among the most interesting fusion algebras are the so-called Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion categories which are realized in (bosonized) Parafermionic CFTs. The corresponding TY[$\mathbb{Z}_k$]-categories have been explicitly realized for the cases $k=2$, $k=3$, and $k=4$ together with the action of the defect lines on the Hilbert space of the corresponding CFTs. For each of the cases, different methods have been used in the previous literature. In the current paper, we present a unified framework for finding the TDLs in bosonized Parafermionic CFTs. Our approach relies on combining several previously used methods and the definition of an extended $S$ matrix. We apply the method to the cases $k=2$ to $k=5$ to extract corresponding TDL fusion algebras.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the phase diagram of supersymmetric QCD with $N_{f}=N_{c}+1$ flavors perturbed by Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB). We extend the previous analyses on s-confining ASQCD theories in three different directions. We show that the existence of the QCD-like vacuum is independent of the size of the SUSY breaking parameter. We further expand the analysis of these models by including two and three-loop contributions to investigate the robustness and limitations of the results. Finally, we include the leading effect of higher-order K\"ahler terms to investigate the stability of the phase diagram as we approach the confining energy scale. The analysis with higher order K\"ahler terms is also extended for $N_{c}=2$ for which AMSB alone gives inconclusive results.</description>

      <title>Black Hole from Entropy Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One quantum characterization of a black hole motivated by (local) holography and thermodynamics is that it maximizes thermodynamic entropy for a given surface area. In the context of quantum gravity, this could be more fundamental than the classical characterization by a horizon. As a step, we explore this possibility by solving the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation with many matter fields, and find a picture of a black hole. For spherical static highly-excited configurations, we apply local typicality and estimate the entropy including self-gravity to derive its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely determines the entropy-maximized configuration: self-gravitating quanta condensate into a radially-uniform dense configuration with no horizon, where the self-gravity and a large quantum pressure induced by the curvatures are balanced and no singularity appears. The interior metric is a self-consistent and non-perturbative solution for Planck's constant. The maximum entropy, given by the volume integral of the entropy density, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula through self-gravity, deriving the Bousso bound for thermodynamic entropy. Finally, 10 future prospects are discussed, leading to the speculative view that the configuration represents semi-classically a quantum-gravitational condensate with holographic bulk dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spin-$(s,j)$ projectors and gauge-invariant spin-$s$ actions in maximally symmetric backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a maximally symmetric $d$-dimensional background with isometry algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, a symmetric and traceless rank-$s$ field $\phi_{a(s)}$ satisfying the massive Klein-Gordon equation furnishes a collection of massive $\mathfrak{g}$-representations with spins $j\in \{0,1,\cdots,s\}$. In this paper we construct the spin-$(s,j)$ projectors, which are operators that isolate the part of $\phi_{a(s)}$ that furnishes the representation from this collection carrying spin $j$. In the case of an (anti-)de Sitter ((A)dS$_d$) background, we find that the poles of the projectors encode information about (partially-)massless representations, in agreement with observations made earlier in $d=3,4$. We then use these projectors to facilitate a systematic derivation of two-derivative actions with a propagating massless spin-$s$ mode. In addition to reproducing the massless spin-$s$ Fronsdal action, this analysis generates new actions possessing higher-depth gauge symmetry. In (A)dS$_d$ we also derive the action for a partially-massless spin-$s$ depth-$t$ field with $1\leq t \leq s$. The latter utilises the minimum number of auxiliary fields, and corresponds to the action originally proposed by Zinoviev after gauging away all St\"{u}ckelberg fields. Some higher-derivative actions are also presented, and in $d=3$ are used to construct (i) generalised higher-spin Cotton tensors in (A)dS$_3$; and (ii) topologically-massive actions with higher-depth gauge symmetry. Finally, in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ Minkowski superspace, we provide closed-form expressions for the analogous superprojectors.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Lorentzian path integral of nonlocal quantum gravity. After introducing the functional measure, the Faddeev-Popov sector and the field correlators, we move to perturbation theory and describe Efimov analytic continuation of scattering amplitudes to Euclidean momenta and back to Lorentzian. We show that the conformal instability problem in the Euclidean path integral is solved by suitable gauge choices at the perturbative level. The three examples of Einstein gravity, Stelle gravity and nonlocal quantum gravity are given.</description>

Abstract: We study the duality between the ABJ(M) theory at Chern-Simons level $k=4$ and the orientifold ABJ theory at Chern-Simons level $k=1$ by using the $S^{3}$ partition function. The partition function can be computed using the supersymmetric localization in terms of a matrix model, and we derive an ideal Fermi gas system by applying the Fermi gas formalism to the matrix model. By using this formalism, we show that the matrix model can be embedded in the partition function of $\hat{A}_{3}$ or $\hat{D}_{3}$ quiver theories, and the equality of these quiver theories, which comes from $\hat{A}_{3}=\hat{D}_{3}$, leads to exact relations of the matrix models. These exact relations can be used to check the identification of the flavor symmetries. The perfect agreement between the matrix models also implies that no decoupled sector is needed.</description>

      <title>A non-Perturbative and Background-Independent Formulation of Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-perturbative and background-independent quantum formulation of quadratic gravity is provided. A canonical quantization procedure introduced in previous works, named after Dirac and Pauli, is here applied to quadratic gravity to obtain, as required by consistency, a well-defined Euclidean path integral. The theory is unitary: all probabilities are non negative and they sum up to one. We obtain path-integral expressions for the transition amplitudes, Green's functions and generic matrix elements of time-ordered products of the metric. As a byproduct, similar results are also obtained for a scalar-field four-derivative interacting model. In this way, among other things, previous perturbative and background-dependent calculations are justified. The (quantum) quadratic gravity effective action, whose field equations determine the vacuum expectation value of the metric in the presence of a generic energy-momentum tensor, is constructed. The classical limit of the effective action turns out to be equivalent to the starting classical action of quadratic gravity, whose runaway rates were previously shown to be slow enough to be compatible with observations. Finally, the constructed non-perturbative and background-independent quantum quadratic gravity is applied to quantum cosmology to obtain a path-integral expression for the wave function of the universe, which satisfies a sort of Wheeler-DeWitt equation. This application allows us to understand at the quantum level why our universe is nearly homogeneous and isotropic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying the holographic method, we investigate correlation functions of boundary and defect conformal field theories. To describe boundary conformal field theory, we consider an end of the world brane in an asymptotic AdS space which behaves as a boundary in the dual conformal field theory. In this holographic setup, we calculate correlation functions involving the reflection effect at the boundary. We show that, when the end of the world brane has no degrees of freedom, the holographic calculation reproduces the correlation functions known in the boundary conformal field theory. When the boundary has nontrivial boundary entropy, we calculate one- and two-point functions nontrivially relying on the boundary entropy. We further study correlation functions of defect conformal field theory after introducing a $p$-brane. We directly derive a bulk-to-defect two-point function without introducing an image operator and determine the coefficient of the two-point function exactly in the holographic setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two new diagrammatic techniques on $3d\;\mathcal N=4$ quiver gauge theories, termed chain and cyclic quiver polymerisation are introduced. These gauge a diagonal $\mathrm{SU}/\mathrm{U}(k)$ subgroup of the Coulomb branch global symmetry of a quiver (or pair of quivers) with multiple legs. The action on the Coulomb branch is that of a $\mathrm{SU}/\mathrm{U}(k)$ hyper-K\"ahler quotient. The polymerisation techniques build and generalise known composition methods from class $\mathcal S$. Polymerisation is used to generate a wide range of magnetic quivers from various physical contexts. These include polymerisation constructions for Kronheimer-Nakajima quivers, which generalise the ADHM construction for the moduli space of $k\;\mathrm{SU}(N)$ instantons on $\mathbb C^2$ to A-type singularities. Also a polymerisation construction of the magnetic quiver for the $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)$ coming from two $\frac{1}{2}$ M5 branes probing an $E_6$ Klein singularity. We find a method of extending magnetic quivers for Class $\mathcal S$ theories to cure the incomplete Higgsing that arises when gluing punctures into the loops associated with higher genus theories. Other novel constructions include a unitary magnetic quiver for the closure of a height four nilpotent orbit of $\mathrm{SO}(7)$. We explore the relationships between the Coulomb and Higgs branches of quivers under polymerisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity addresses the old cosmological constant (CC) problem, explaining why such constant is not at least as large as the largest particle mass scale, but classically it is indistinguishable from ordinary gravity. Conversely, quantum physics may give us a way to distinguish the two theories. Thus, here the unimodular constraint is imposed on a non-perturbative and background-independent quantum version of quadratic gravity, which was recently formulated. It is shown that unimodularity does lead to different predictions for some inflationary quantum observables. Unimodular gravity per se does not solves the new CC problem (why the CC has the observed value?) even in this realization. To address this issue a multiverse made by different eras in a single big bang is considered and the observed scale of dark energy is explained anthropically.</description>

Abstract: Force-Free Electrodynamics (FFE) describes magnetically dominated relativistic plasma via non-linear equations for the electromagnetic field alone. Such plasma is thought to play a key role in the physics of pulsars and active black holes. Despite its simple covariant formulation, FFE has primarily been studied in 3+1 frameworks, where spacetime is split into space and time. In this article we systematically develop the theory of force-free magnetospheres taking a spacetime perspective. Using a suite of spacetime tools and techniques (notably exterior calculus) we cover 1) the basics of the theory, 2) exact solutions that demonstrate the extraction and transport of the rotational energy of a compact object (in the case of a black hole, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism), 3) the behavior of current sheets, 4) the general theory of stationary, axisymmetric magnetospheres and 5) general properties of pulsar and black hole magnetospheres. We thereby synthesize, clarify and generalize known aspects of the physics of force-free magnetospheres, while also introducing several new results.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Inflation, Reheating and Dark Radiation in a IIB perturbative moduli stabilization scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological implications of an effective field theory model derived within a configuration of D7 brane stacks in the framework of type-IIB string theory. We consider a suitable geometric setup where the K\"ahler moduli fields are stabilized and the parametric space is constrained so that a de Sitter vacuum is ensured. In addition to the moduli fields we also take into account the usual Higgs and matter fields included in the effective field theory. In this background, we implement the standard hybrid inflation scenario with a singlet scalar field acting as the inflaton and the Higgs states serving as waterfall fields. Radiative corrections and soft supersymmetry breaking terms play an essential role in the realization of a successful inflationary scenario consistent with the present cosmological data. Small tensor-to-scalar ratio values are predicted, which can be probed in future planned experiments. Further constraints on the model's parameters are derived from bounds on dark radiation which is measured as a contribution to the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$. In particular, we find an excess of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\leq{0.95}$ at $2\sigma$ confidence level with natural values of the involved couplings.</description>

      <title>Fermions with Electric Dipole Moment in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the relativistic behavior of spin--half particles possessing an Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) in a curved spacetime background induced by a spiral dislocation. A thorough review of the mathematical formulation of the Dirac spinor in the framework of quantum field theory sets the foundation for our investigation. By deriving the action that governs the interaction between the spinor field, the background spacetime, and an external electric field, we establish a framework to study the dynamics of the system. Solving the resulting wave equation reveals a set of coupled equations for the radial components of the Dirac spinor, which give rise to a modified energy spectrum attributed to the EDM. To validate our findings, we apply them to the geometric phase and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Detector-based measurements for QFT: two issues and an AQFT proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and investigate two issues within the measurement scheme for QFT presented by J. Polo-G\'omez, L. J. Garay and E. Mart\'in-Mart\'inez in "A detector-based measurement theory for quantum field theory". We point out some discrepancies that arise when the measurement scheme is applied to contextual field states and show that $n$-point function assignments based on local processing regions sometimes lead to inconsistencies. To solve these issues, we modify the measurement scheme to use non-relativistic detectors to induce an update rule for algebraic states in the Haag-Kastler formulation of quantum field theory. In this way, $n$-point functions can be consistently evaluated across any region having a definite causal relation with measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum geodesics reflecting the internal structure of stars composed of shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, an external observer cannot distinguish distinct internal structures between two spherically symmetric stars that have the same total mass $M$. However, when quantum corrections are taken into account, the external metrics of the stars will receive quantum corrections depending on their internal structures. In this paper, we obtain the quantum-corrected metrics at linear order in curvature for two spherically symmetric shells characterized by different internal structures: one with an empty interior and the other with $N$ internal shells. The dependence on the internal structures in the corrected metrics tells us that geodesics on these backgrounds would be deformed according to the internal structures. We conduct numerical computations to find out the angle of geodesic precession and show that the presence of internal structures amplifies the precession angle reflecting the discrepancy between the radial and orbital periods within the geodesic orbit. The amount of the precession angle increases monotonically as the number of internal shells increases and it eventually converges to a certain value for $N \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Inflation with vector fields revisited: heavy entropy perturbations and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit inflation coupled with vector fields employing kinetic coupling in the comoving gauge. It is known that there is a cumulative effect $\tilde{I}N^2$ on curvature power spectrum. For a large number of e-foldings $N$, this contribution is so significant that it could violate observational constraints when the ratio of kinetic energy between vector fields and inflaton $\tilde{I}$ is not extremely small. In this paper, we explore the regime where $\tilde{I}\gg 1$, a realm that has not been extensively explored due to the limitations of perturbative methods. We found that the entropy perturbation becomes heavy in this regime and the cumulative effect decays away on super-horizon scales. Consequently, the power spectrum retains its scale invariance in the decoupling limit. By straightforwardly integrating out the heavy modes near horizon-crossing, we derive a low-energy effective field theory describing a massless adiabatic perturbation with an imaginary speed of sound $c_s^2= -1/3$. Namely, the inflation with vector fields presents a potential mechanism for generating primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connection is established between transonic sound waves propagating along a de Laval nozzle and quasinormal modes emitted from hairy black holes obtained with the gravitational decoupling method applied to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. Aerodynamical features provide an analogue setup to experimentally test fluid flow perturbations in a de Laval nozzle producing quasinormal modes. In particular, nozzle shape, pressure, Mach number, temperature, density, and thrust coefficient profiles are determined as functions of the black hole parameters for several multipole numbers. The black hole quasinormal mode frequencies are also investigated for different overtones, evaluating the quality factor of the nozzle.</description>

      <title>Landscapes of integrable long-range spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  The limit $q\to1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. At finite size, only the latter is U(1)-symmetric.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry (HS) chains, as well as the Inozemtsev chain and its recent q-deformation. We find that the two landscapes only share a single point: the rational HS chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the anti-periodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations for Rotating Scalar and Vector Boson Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic stars represent a hypothetical exotic type of compact stellar objects that could be observed from the gravitational signal of coalescing binaries in current and future gravitational wave detectors. There are two main families of bosonic stars, which depend on the nature that governs the particles that build them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon and Proca Stars. We study the multipolar structure for both families of rotating objects, using realistic potentials with the aim of finding possible universal relations and, thus, a method that allows us to distinguish between these and other compact objects in the gravitational wave paradigm. We also show how certain relevant observables can be obtained for these hypothetical but well-motivated astrophysical objects.</description>
