      <title>A contact process with stronger mutations on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spatial stochastic model for a pathogen population growing inside a host that attempts to eliminate the pathogens through its immune system. The pathogen population is divided into different types. A pathogen can either reproduce by generating a pathogen of its own type or produce a pathogen of a new type that does not yet exist in the population. Pathogens with living ancestral types are protected against the host's immune system as long as their progenitors are still alive. Each pathogen type without living ancestral types is eliminated by the immune system after a random period, independently of the other types. When a pathogen type is eliminated from the system, all pathogens of this type die simultaneously. In this paper, we determine the conditions on the set of model parameters that dictate the survival or extinction of the pathogen population when the dynamics unfold on graphs with an infinite tree structure.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional particle clouds with elastic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an interacting particle system of a finite number of labelled particles on the integer lattice, in which particles have intrinsic masses and left/right jump rates. If a particle is the minimal-label particle at its site when it tries to jump left, the jump is executed. If not, `momentum' is transferred to increase the rate of jumping left of the minimal-label particle. Similarly for jumps to the right. The collision rule is `elastic' in the sense that the net rate of flow of mass is independent of the present configuration, in contrast to the exclusion process, for example. We show that the particle masses and jump rates determine explicitly, via a concave majorant of a simple `potential' function associated to the masses and jump rates, a unique partition of the system into maximal stable subsystems. The internal configuration of each stable subsystem remains tight, while the location of each stable subsystem obeys a strong law of large numbers with an explicit speed. We indicate connections to adjacent models, including diffusions with rank-based coefficients.</description>

      <title>Revisiting scaling limits for critical inhomogeneous random graphs with finite third moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the rank-1 inhomogeneous random graph in the Brownian regime in the critical window. Aldous studied the weights of the components, and showed that this ordered sequence converges in the $\ell^2$-topology to the ordered excursions of a Brownian motion with parabolic drift when appropriately rescaled (http://doi.org/10.1214/aop/1024404421), as the number of vertices $n$ tends to infinity. We show that, under the finite third moment condition, the same conclusion holds for the ordered component sizes. This in particular proves a result claimed by Bhamidi, Van der Hofstad and Van Leeuwaarden (https://doi.org/10.1214/EJP.v15-817). We also show that, for the large components, the ranking by component weights coincides with the ranking by component sizes with high probability as $n \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Percolative properties of the random coprime colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $u$ and $v$ in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, say that $u$ is visible from $v$ if the segment from $u$ to $v$ contains exactly two elements, which are $u$ and $v$. Take $X$ "uniformly at random in $\mathbb{Z}^d$" and colour each vertex $u$ of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in white if $u$ is visible from $X$ and in black otherwise. Previous independent works of Pleasants-Huck and of the third author give a precise meaning to this definition. This paper is dedicated to the study of this random colouring from the point of view of percolation theory: given a reasonable graph structure on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, how many infinite black (resp. white) connected components are there?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an abstract Hilbert space-valued framework of Markovian lifts for stochastic Volterra equations with operator-valued Volterra kernels. Our main results address the existence and characterisation of possibly multiple limit distributions and stationary processes, a law of large numbers including a convergence rate, and the central limit theorem for time averages of the process within the Gaussian domain of attraction. As particular examples, we study Markovian lifts based on Laplace transforms in a weighted Hilbert space of densities and Markovian lifts based on the shift semigroup on the Filipovi\'c space. We illustrate our results for the case of fractional stochastic Volterra equations with additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Quenched and annealed heat kernel estimates for Brox's diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brox's diffusion is a typical one-dimensional singular diffusion, which was introduced by Brox (1986) as a continuous analogue of Sinai's random walk. In this paper, we will establish quenched heat kernel estimates for short time and annealed heat kernel estimates for large time of Brox's diffusion. The proofs are based on Brox's construction via the scale-transformation and the time-change arguments as well as the theory of resistance forms for symmetric strongly recurrent Markov processes. We emphasize that, since the reference measure of Brox's diffusion does not satisfy the so-called volume doubling conditions neither for the small scale nor the large scale, the existing methods for heat kernel estimates of diffusions in ergodic media do not work, and new techniques will be introduced to establish both quenched and annealed heat kernel estimates of Brox's diffusions, which take into account different oscillation properties for one-dimensional Brownian motion in random environments.</description>

      <title>A transport approach to the cutoff phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic statistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present paper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy and exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical parabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to non-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer requires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications, we recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave Langevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time sampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.</description>

      <title>Gap metrics for stationary point processes and quantitative convexity of the free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in convexity properties of the free energy for stationary point processes on $\mathbb R$ w.r.t.\ a new geometry inspired by optimal transport. We will show for a rich class of pairwise interaction energies
  A) quantified strict convexity of the free energy implying uniqueness of minimizers
  B) existence of a gradient flow curve of the free energy w.r.t. the new metric converging exponentially fast to the unique minimizer.
  Examples for energies for which A holds include logarithmic or Riesz interactions with parameter $0&lt;s&lt;1$, examples for which A and B hold are hypersingular Riesz or Yukawa interactions.</description>

      <title>The Random Walk Pinning Model II: Upper bounds on the free energy and disorder relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the question of disorder relevance for the continuous-time Random Walk Pinning Model (RWPM) and completes the results of our companion paper. The RWPM considers a continuous time random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$, whose law is modified by a Gibbs weight given by $\exp(\beta \int_0^T \mathbf{1}_{\{X_t=Y_t\}} dt)$, where $Y=(Y_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is a quenched trajectory of a second (independent) random walk and $\beta \geq 0$ is the inverse temperature. The random walk $Y$ has the same distribution as $X$ but a jump rate $\rho \geq 0$, interpreted as the disorder intensity. For fixed $\rho\ge 0$, the RWPM undergoes a localization phase transition as $\beta$ crosses a critical threshold $\beta_c(\rho)$. The question of disorder relevance then consists in determining whether a disorder of arbitrarily small intensity $\rho$ changes the properties of the phase transition. We focus our analysis on the case of transient $\gamma$-stable walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. random walks in the domain of attraction of a $\gamma$-stable law, with $\gamma\in (0,1)$. In the present paper, we show that disorder is relevant when $\gamma \in (0,\frac23]$, namely that $\beta_c(\rho)&gt;\beta_c(0)$ for every $\rho&gt;0$. We also provide lower bounds on the critical point shift, which are matching the upper bounds obtained in our companion paper. Interestingly, in the marginal case $\gamma = \frac23$, disorder is always relevant, independently of the fine properties of the random walk distribution. When $\gamma \in (\frac23,1)$, our companion paper proves that disorder is irrelevant (in particular $\beta_c(\rho)=\beta_c(0)$ for $\rho$ small enough). We provide here an upper bound on the free energy in the regime $\gamma\in (\frac 2 3,1)$ that highlights the fact that although disorder is irrelevant, it still has a non-trivial effect on the phase transition, at any $\rho&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The Random Walk Pinning Model I: Lower bounds on the free energy and disorder irrelevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random Walk Pinning Model (RWPM) is a statistical mechanics model in which the trajectory of a continuous time random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is rewarded according to the time it spends together with a moving catalyst. More specifically for a system of size $T$, the law of $X$ is tilted by the Gibbs factor $\exp(\beta \int_0^T \mathbf{1}_{\{X_t=Y_t\}} dt)$, where $\beta \geq 0$ is the inverse temperature. The moving catalyst $Y=(Y_t)_{t\ge 0}$ is given by the quenched trajectory of a second continuous-time random walk, with the same distribution as $X$ but a different jump rate $\rho\geq 0$, interpreted as the disorder intensity. For fixed $\rho\ge 0$, the RWPM undergoes a localization phase transition when $\beta$ passes a critical value $\beta_c(\rho)$. We thoroughly investigate the question of disorder relevance to determine whether a disorder of arbitrarily small intensity affects the features of the phase transition. We focus our analysis on the case of transient $\gamma$-stable walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. random walks in the domain of attraction of a $\gamma$-stable law, with $\gamma\in (0,1)$. In the present paper, we derive lower bounds for the free energy, which results in either a proof of disorder irrelevance or upper bounds on the critical point shift. More precisely, when $\gamma \in(\frac23,1)$, our estimates imply that that $\beta_c(\rho)=\beta_c(0)$ and $\rho$ is small, showing disorder irrelevance. When $\gamma\in (0,\frac23]$ our companion paper shows that $\beta_c(\rho)&gt;\beta_c(0)$ for every $\rho&gt;0$, showing disorder relevance: we derive here upper bounds on the critical point shift, which are matching the lower bounds obtained in our companion paper. For good measure, our analysis also includes the case of the simple random walk of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for $d\ge 3$) for which no upper bound on the critical point shift was previously known.</description>

      <title>Products of Finitely-Generated Groups with a Certain Growth Condition Have Fixed Price One</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open problem posed by Gaboriau is whether the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. We provide an affirmative answer if the two groups are finitely generated and their growths satisfy a specific condition. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak factor of i.i.d., where each horoball is equipped with a marking that depends only on the first coordinate, in an i.i.d. manner. Then, a low-cost graphing of this process is constructed using the markings of the horoballs and adding a percolation with small intensity.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed semi-discrete finite element approximation and full discretization of the Stochastic semilinear generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by additive Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and the semi-implicit method for time discretization and derive a strong convergence rate with respect to both parameters (spatial and temporal). Numerical experiments have also been performed to support theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Gradient Descent for Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is an alternative to entropic regularization when sparse couplings or small regularization parameters are desired. Here quadratic regularization means that transport couplings are penalized by the squared $L^2$ norm, or equivalently the $\chi^2$ divergence. While a number of computational approaches have been shown to work in practice, quadratic regularization is analytically less tractable than entropic, and we are not aware of a previous theoretical convergence rate analysis. We focus on the gradient descent algorithm for the dual transport problem in continuous and semi-discrete settings. This problem is convex but not strongly convex; its solutions are the potential functions that approximate the Kantorovich potentials of unregularized optimal transport. The gradient descent steps are straightforward to implement, and stable for small regularization parameter -- in contrast to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the entropic setting. Our main result is that gradient descent converges linearly; that is, the $L^2$ distance between the iterates and the limiting potentials decreases exponentially fast. Our analysis centers on the linearization of the gradient descent operator at the optimum and uses functional-analytic arguments to bound its spectrum. These techniques seem to be novel in this area and are substantially different from the approaches familiar in entropic optimal transport.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical entropy method for the delocalization of bias in high-dimensional Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is widely used for sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions. It is well known to be biased, with the bias typically scaling linearly with the dimension when measured in squared Wasserstein distance. However, the recent paper of Chen et al. (2024) identifies an intriguing new delocalization effect: For a class of distributions with sparse interactions, the bias between low-dimensional marginals scales only with the lower dimension, not the full dimension. In this work, we strengthen the results of Chen et al. (2024) in the sparse interaction regime by removing a logarithmic factor, measuring distance in relative entropy (a.k.a. KL-divergence), and relaxing the strong log-concavity assumption. In addition, we expand the scope of the delocalization phenomenon by showing that it holds for a class of distributions with weak interactions. Our proofs are based on a hierarchical analysis of the marginal relative entropies, inspired by the authors' recent work on propagation of chaos.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new Markov Chain called the Cycle Walk for sampling measures of graph partitions where the partition elements have roughly equal size. Such Markov Chains are of current interest in the generation and evaluation of political districts. We present numerical evidence that this chain can efficiently sample target distributions that have been difficult for existing sampling Markov chains.</description>

      <title>The polynomial growth of the infinite long-range percolation cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study independent long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ where the nearest-neighbor edges are always open and the probability that two vertices $x,y$ with $\|x-y\|&gt;1$ are connected by an edge is proportional to $\frac{\beta}{\|x-y\|^s}$, where $\beta&gt;0$ and $s&gt; 0$ are parameters. We show that the ball of radius $k$ centered at the origin in the graph metric grows polynomially if and only if $s\geq 2d$. For the critical case $s=2d$, we show that the volume growth exponent is inversely proportional to the distance growth exponent. Furthermore, we provide sharp upper and lower bounds on the probability that the origin and $ne_1$ are connected by a path of length $k$ in the critical case $s=2d$. We use these results to determine the Hausdorff dimension of the critical long-range percolation metric that was recently constructed by Ding, Fan, and Huang [14].</description>

      <title>Simulating diffusion bridges using the Wiener chaos expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we simulate diffusion bridges by using an approximation of the Wiener-chaos expansion (WCE), or a Fourier-Hermite expansion, for a related diffusion process. Indeed, we consider the solution of stochastic differential equations, and we apply the WCE to a particular representation of the diffusion bridge. Thus, we obtain a method to simulate the proposal diffusion bridges that is fast and that in every attempt constructs a diffusion bridge, which means there are no rejection rates. The method presented in this work could be very useful in statistical inference. We validate the method with a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We apply our method to three examples of SDEs and show the numerical results.</description>

      <title>A spatial model for dormancy in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a spatial model for dormancy in random environment via a two-type branching random walk in continuous-time, where individuals can switch between dormant and active states through spontaneous switching independent of the random environment. However, the branching mechanism is governed by a random environment which dictates the branching rates. We consider three specific choices for random environments composed of particles: (1) a Bernoulli field of immobile particles, (2) one moving particle, and (3) a Poisson field of moving particles. In each case, the particles of the random environment can either be interpreted as catalysts, accelerating the branching mechanism, or as traps, aiming to kill the individuals. The different between active and dormant individuals is defined in such a way that dormant individuals are protected from being trapped, but do not participate in migration or branching. We quantify the influence of dormancy on the growth resp. survival of the population by identifying the large-time asymptotics of the expected population size. The starting point for our mathematical considerations and proofs is the parabolic Anderson model via the Feynman- Kac formula. Especially, the quantitative investigation of the role of dormancy is done by extending the Parabolic Anderson model to a two-type random walk.</description>

      <title>On the maximal correlation of some stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the maximal correlation coefficient $R(X,Y)$ between two stochastic processes $X$ and $Y$. In the case when $(X,Y)$ is a random walk, we find $R(X,Y)$ using the Cs\'{a}ki-Fischer identity and the lower semicontinuity of the map $\text{Law}(X,Y) \to R(X,Y)$. When $(X,Y)$ is a two-dimensional L\'{e}vy process, we express $R(X,Y)$ in terms of the L\'{e}vy measure of the process and the covariance matrix of the diffusion part of the process. Consequently, for a two-dimensional $\alpha$-stable random vector $(X,Y)$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$, we express $R(X,Y)$ in terms of $\alpha$ and the spectral measure $\tau$ of the $\alpha$-stable distribution. We also establish analogs and extensions of the Dembo-Kagan-Shepp-Yu inequality and the Madiman-Barron inequality.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the linear functionals for supercritical non-local branching superprocesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $\{X_{t}:t\ge 0\}$ is a supercritical superprocess on a Luzin space $E$, with a non-local branching mechanism and probabilities $\mathbb{P}_{\delta_{x}}$, when initiated from a unit mass at $x\in E$. By ``supercritical", we mean that the first moment semigroup of $X_{t}$ exhibits a Perron-Frobenius type behaviour characterized by an eigentriplet $(\lambda_{1},\varphi,\widetilde{\varphi})$, where the principal eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}$ is greater than $0$. Under a second moment condition, we prove that $X_{t}$ satisfies a law of large numbers. The main purpose of this paper is to further investigate the fluctuations of the linear functional $\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda_{1}t}\langle f,X_{t}\rangle$ around the limit given by the law of large numbers. To this end, we introduce a parameter $\epsilon(f)$ for a bounded measurable function $f$, which determines the exponent term of the decay rate for the first moment of the fluctuation. Qualitatively, the second-order behaviour of $\langle f,X_{t}\rangle$ depends on the sign of $\epsilon(f)-\lambda_{1}/2$. We prove that, for a suitable test function $f$, the fluctuation of the associated linear functional exhibits distinct asymptotic behaviours depending on the magnitude of $\epsilon(f)$: If $\epsilon(f)\ge \lambda_{1}/2$, the fluctuation converges in distribution to a Gaussian limit under appropriate normalization; If $\epsilon(f)&lt;\lambda_{1}/2$, the fluctuation converges to an $L^{2}$ limit with a larger normalization factor. In particular, when the test function is chosen as the right eigenfunction $\varphi$, we establish a functional central limit theorem. As an application, we consider a multitype superdiffusion in a bounded domain. For this model, we derive limit theorems for the fluctuations of arbitrary linear functionals.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the entropy production rate and time-reversibility for general jump diffusions (L\'{e}vy processes) on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We first formulate the entropy production rate and explore its associated thermodynamic relations for jump diffusions. Subsequently, we derive the entropy production rate using the relative entropy between the forward and time-reversed path measures for stationary jump diffusions via the Girsanov transform. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence among time-reversibility, zero entropy production rate, detailed balance condition, and the gradient structure for stationary jump diffusions.</description>

      <title>Supercritical phase of the random connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $d \in {\bf N}, \lambda &gt;0$, the random connection model in a region $A \subseteq {\bf R}^d$ is a graph with vertex set given by a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity $\lambda $ in $A$, with an edge placed between each pair $x,y$ of vertices with probability $\phi(\|x-y\|)$, where $\phi: {\bf R}_+ \to [0,1]$ is a nonincreasing finite-range connection function. We show that if $d \geq 3$ and $\lambda$ is strictly supercritical for $A = {\bf R}^d$, then the model remains supercritical if it is restricted to a region $A$ of the form ${\bf R}^2 \times [-K/2,K/2]^{d-2}$, provided $K$ is sufficiently large. This is a continuum analogue of a well-known result of Grimmett and Marstrand for lattice percolation. We prove this by adapting Grimmett and Marstrand's original proof; Faggionato and Hartarsky have also proved this recently by other means.</description>

Abstract: We derive some rather general, but complicated, formulae to compute the survival function and the first passage time distribution of the $n^\text{th}$ coordinate of a many-body stochastic process in the presence of a killing barrier. First we will study the case of two coordinates and then we will generalize the results to three or more coordinates. Even if the results are difficult to implement, we will provide examples of their use applying them to a physical system, the single file diffusion, and to the financial problem of pricing a $n^\text{th}$-to-default credit default swap ($n^\text{th}$-CDS)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of regularity structures [Hai14] to allow processes belonging to locally $m$-convex topological algebras. This extension includes processes in the locally $C^{*}$-algebras of [CHP25] used to localise singular stochastic partial differential equations involving fermions, as well as processes in Banach algebras such as infinite-dimensional semicircular\circular Brownian motion, and more generally the $q$-Gaussians of [BS91, BKS97, Bo\.z99].
  A new challenge we encounter in the $q$-Gaussian setting with $q \in (-1,1)$ are noncommutative renormalisation estimates where we must estimate operators in homogeneous $q$-Gaussian chaoses with arbitrary operator insertions. We introduce a new Banach algebra norm on $q$-Gaussian operators that allows us to control such insertions; we believe this construction could be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skorokhod's J1 and M1 topologies are standard tools in proving limit theorems for stochastic processes. Motivated by applications, we extend these topologies so that they are capable of describing the convergence of a sequence of functions that are not all defined on the same domain. Traditionally, the J1 and M1 topologies are defined using time changes. Instead, we base our definitions on the point of view that the graph of a cadlag function can naturally be viewed as a compact set that is equipped with a total order. The distance between two graphs is then measured by matching points on one graph with points on the other graph in a way that respects the total order. We treat the J1 and M1 topologies in a unified framework and simplify the existing theory. We introduce a space of paths, elements of which are cadlag functions defined on an arbitrary closed subset of the real line. We show that this space is Polish and derive compactness criteria. Specialised to functions that are all defined on the same domain, this yields new proofs of known results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a discrete harmonic function which is bounded on a large portion of a periodic planar graph is constant. A key ingredient is a new unique continuation result for the weighted graph Laplacian. The proof relies on the structure of level sets of discrete harmonic functions, using arguments as in Bou-Rabee--Cooperman--Dario (2023) which exploit the fact that, on a planar graph, the sub- and super-level sets cannot cross over each other. In the special case of the square lattice this yields a new, geometric proof of the Liouville theorem of Buhovsky--Logunov--Malinnikova--Sodin (2017).</description>

Abstract: Using the group structure of the state space of $q-$state models, a new definition of contour for long-range spin-systems in $\Z^d$ ($d\geq 2$), and a multidimensional version of Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer contours, we prove phase transition for a class of ferromagnetic long-range systems which includes the Clock and Potts models. Our arguments work for the entire region of exponents of regular power-law interactions, namely $\alpha &gt; d$, and for any $q \geq 2$. As an application, we prove phase transition for Potts models with decaying fields when the field decays fast enough and in the presence of a random external field.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Gaussian Code-books for Signaling over a Two-Users Weak Gaussian Interference Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article shows that the capacity region of a 2-users weak Gaussian interference channel is achieved using Gaussian code-books. The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books. Optimality of Gaussian code-books is first established by limiting the random coding to independent and identically distributed scalar (single-letter) samples. Then, it is shown that the optimum solution for vector inputs coincides with the single-letter case. It is also shown that the maximum number of phases needed to realize the gain due to power allocation over time is two. It is also established that the solution to the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region, with single letter Gaussian random code-books, achieves the optimum boundary.</description>

      <title>A decision-theoretic approach to dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a decision-theoretic framework for dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics. This uncertainty is two-fold: on the one hand there may be uncertainty about the state the quantum system is in, and on the other hand, as is essential to quantum mechanical uncertainty, even if the quantum state is known, measurements may still produce an uncertain outcome. In our framework, measurements therefore play the role of acts with an uncertain outcome and our simple decision-theoretic postulates ensure that Born's rule is encapsulated in the utility functions associated with such acts. This approach allows us to uncouple (precise) probability theory from quantum mechanics, in the sense that it leaves room for a more general, so-called imprecise probabilities approach. We discuss the mathematical implications of our findings, which allow us to give a decision-theoretic foundation to recent seminal work by Benavoli, Facchini and Zaffalon, and we compare our approach to earlier and different approaches by Deutsch and Wallace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of stochastic variational principles involves the problem of constructing fixed-endpoint and adapted variations of semimartingales. We provide a detailed construction of variations of semimartingales that are not only fixed at deterministic endpoints, but also fixed at first entry times and first exit times for charts in a manifold. We prove a stochastic version of the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations in the context of these variations. Using this framework, we provide a generalization of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle in local coordinates to arbitrary noise semimartingales. For the corresponding global form of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we introduce a novel approach to global variational principles by restricting to semimartingales obtained as solutions of Stratonovich equations.</description>
