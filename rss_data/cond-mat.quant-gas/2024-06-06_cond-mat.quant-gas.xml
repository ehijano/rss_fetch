      <title>Dissipative realization of Kondo models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative implementation of a variety of Kondo models by means of strong two-body losses localized on a few impurity sites of a fermionic lattice--a setup which is suited to experiments with ultracold atomic gases. We study in detail the simplest scenario of just one dissipated site, showing that it is effectively described by the Anderson impurity model with infinite repulsion, perturbed by a small residual dissipation. We compute a number of signatures of the Kondo effect in transport across the impurity, finding a competition between the Kondo resonance and the residual dissipation. Our dissipative setup can be generalized to two or more sites subject to losses--realizing an impurity with spin 1 or higher--and more reservoirs, opening up the possibility of simulating several kinds of Kondo-like models with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Monte Carlo Simulation of Superfluid Ring Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to lay the groundwork to construct and characterize a quantum device; which we refer to as a superfluid ring lattice; that could serve as a multi-qubit system in the future. Accordingly, a mathematical framework, called the Integer Lattice Method (ILM), is exploited to construct a two-dimensional optical landscape which could facilitate a superfluid ring qubit. The Integer Lattice Method allows one to design and explore both periodic and quasi-periodic structured coherent wave interference patterns. Furthermore, the formalism allows for a direct link to experimental realization. The lattices obtained from ILM can be investigated using WA-PIMC. In particular, the spatial and superfluid density at equilibrium are observables of interest to obtain our objective.
  In this thesis, the ab-initio Path Integral Monte Carlo Worm algorithm is implemented with the future aim of investigating the construction of superfluid ring lattices. It is written in independent and interchangeable modules in the novel programming language Julia. To ensure scalability, a custom nearest-neighbour algorithm is added. The simulation software is benchmarked by comparing it with exact analytical results from the non-interacting Bose gas model. Emerging issues with our implementation of the Worm algorithm are identified and thoroughly investigated. Finally, some preliminary results on the equilibrium density distribution of the found ILM lattices are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations with Bilayer 2D Bose Gases in Multiple-RF-dressed Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-RF (MRF) dressing allows trapping of ultracold atoms in novel spatial geometries, such as highly controllable bilayer structures for 2D ultracold gases, providing unique opportunities for the investigation of 2D quantum systems both in and out of equilibrium. Here, we give an overview of the recent developments of MRF-dressed atom experiments, illustrated by the detailed studies of universal relaxation dynamics across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical point enabled by coherent splitting quench protocols and detection of correlations via spatially selective matter-wave interferometry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Asymmetry in non-Abelian Anyonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons, a promising platform for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, adhere to the charge super-selection rule (cSSR), which imposes restrictions on physically allowed states and operations. However, the ramifications of cSSR and fusion rules in anyonic quantum information theory remain largely unexplored. In this study, we unveil that the information-theoretic characteristics of anyons diverge fundamentally from those of non-anyonic systems such as qudits, bosons, and fermions and display intricate structures. In bipartite anyonic systems, pure states may have different marginal spectra, and mixed states may contain pure marginal states. More striking is that in a pure entangled state, parties may lack equal access to entanglement. This entanglement asymmetry is manifested in quantum teleportation employing an entangled anyonic state shared between Alice and Bob, where Alice can perfectly teleport unknown quantum information to Bob, but Bob lacks this capability. These traits challenge conventional understanding, necessitating new approaches to characterize quantum information and correlations in anyons. We expect that these distinctive features will also be present in non-Abelian lattice gauge field theories. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of the information-theoretic aspects of anyons and may lead to realizations of quantum communication and cryptographic protocols where one party holds sway over the other.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay between mass-energy equivalence, interactions and entanglement in an optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose protocols that probe manifestations of the mass-energy equivalence in an optical lattice clock (OLC) interrogated with spin coherent and entangled quantum states. To tune and uniquely distinguish the mass-energy equivalence effects (gravitational redshift and second order Doppler shift) in such setting, we devise a dressing protocol using an additional nuclear spin state. We then analyze the interplay between photon-mediated interactions and gravitational redshift and show that such interplay can lead to entanglement generation and frequency synchronization. In the regime where all atomic spins synchronize, we show the synchronization time depends on the initial entanglement of the state and can be used as a proxy of its metrological gain compared to a classical state. Our work opens new possibilities for exploring the effects of general relativity on quantum coherence and entanglement in OLC experiments.</description>

      <title>Analytic thermodynamic properties of the Lieb-Liniger gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous (e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories, allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.</description>

      <title>Dark state transport between unitary Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of dark states is an important concept in quantum sciences, but its compatibility with strong interparticle interactions, for example, in a quantum degenerate gas is hardly explored. Here, we realize a dark state in one of the spins of a two-component, resonantly-interacting Fermi gas using a $\Lambda$ system within the $D_2$ transitions of $^6$Li at high magnetic field. The dark state is created in a micrometer-sized region within a one-dimensional channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs. The particle transport between the reservoirs is used as a probe. We observe that atoms are transported in the dark state and the superfluid-assisted fast current is preserved. If the dark state resonant condition is not met, the transport is suppressed by the spontaneous emission. We also uncover an asymmetry in the transport timescale across the two-photon resonance, which is absent in the non-interacting regime. This work raises questions on the interplay of dark states with interparticle interactions and opens up perspectives for optical manipulation of fermionic pairing.</description>
