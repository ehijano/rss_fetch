      <title>A Hybrid DEC-SIE Framework for Potential-Based Electromagnetic Analysis of Heterogeneous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing electromagnetic fields in complex, multi-material environments presents substantial computational challenges. To address these, we propose a hybrid numerical method that couples discrete exterior calculus (DEC) with surface integral equations (SIE) in the potential-based formulation of Maxwell's equations. The method employs the magnetic vector and electric scalar potentials ($\mathbf{A}$-$\Phi$) under the Lorenz gauge, offering natural compatibility with multi-physics couplings and inherent immunity to low-frequency breakdown. To effectively handle both bounded and unbounded regions, we divide the computational domain: the inhomogeneous interior is discretized using DEC, a coordinate-free framework that preserves topological invariants and enables structure-preserving discretization on unstructured meshes, while the homogeneous exterior is treated using SIEs, which inherently satisfy the radiation condition and eliminate the need for artificial domain truncation. A key contribution of this work is a scalar reformulation of the SIEs, which reduces the number of surface integral operators from fourteen to two by expressing the problem in terms of the Cartesian components of the vector potential and their normal derivatives. This simplification motivates a corresponding adaptation in the DEC domain: each vector potential component is represented as a discrete 0-form, in contrast to the conventional 1-form representation. This novel treatment improves compatibility at the interface and significantly enhances numerical performance. The proposed hybrid method thus offers a unified, efficient, and physically consistent framework for solving electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems in complex geometries and heterogeneous materials</description>

      <title>Symplectic Hamiltonian Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Linearized Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the numerical approximation of the linearized shallow water equations using hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the evolution system. First, we propose an equivalent formulation of the equations by introducing an auxiliary variable. Then, we discretize the space variables using HDG methods, resulting in a semi-discrete scheme that preserves a discrete version of the Hamiltonian structure. The use of an alternative formulation with the auxiliary variable is crucial for developing the HDG scheme that preserves this Hamiltonian structure. The resulting system is subsequently discretized in time using symplectic integrators, ensuring the energy conservation of the fully discrete scheme. We present numerical experiments that demonstrate optimal convergence rates for all variables and showcase the conservation of total energy, as well as the evolution of other physical quantities.</description>

      <title>An efficient asymptotic preserving Monte Carlo method for frequency-dependent radiative transfer equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient asymptotic-preserving (AP) Monte Carlo (MC) method for frequency-dependent radiative transfer equations (RTEs), which is based on the AP-MC method proposed for the gray RTEs in \cite{shi2023efficient}. We follow the characteristics-based approach by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2023asymptotic} to get a reformulated model, which couples a low dimension convection-diffusion-type equation for macroscopic quantities with a high dimension transport equation for the radiative intensity.
  To recover the correct free streaming limit due to frequency-dependency, we propose a correction to the reformulated macroscopic equation.
  The macroscopic system is solved using a hybrid method:
  convective fluxes are handled by a particle-based MC method, while diffusive fluxes are treated implicitly with central difference.
  To address the nonlinear coupling between radiative intensity and the Planck function across multiple frequency groups, we adopt a Picard iteration with a predictor-corrector procedure, which decouples a global nonlinear system into a linear system restricted to spatial dimension (independent of frequency) with scalar algebraic nonlinear equations.
  Once the macroscopic update is done, the transport equation, with a known emission source provided by the macroscopic variables, is efficiently solved using an implicit MC method. This approach enables larger time steps independent of the speed of light and also the frequency across a wide range, significantly enhancing computational efficiency, especially for frequency-dependent RTEs.
  Formal AP analysis in the diffusive scaling is established. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the high efficiency and AP property of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fast reconstruction approaches for photoacoustic tomography with smoothing Sobolev/Mat\'ern priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), the computation of the initial pressure distribution within an object from its time-dependent boundary measurements over time is considered. This problem can be approached from two well-established points of view: deterministically using regularisation methods, or stochastically using the Bayesian framework. Both approaches frequently require the solution of a variational problem. In the paper we elaborate the connection between these approaches by establishing the equivalence between a smoothing Mat{\'e}rn class of covariance operators and Sobolev embedding operator $E_s: H^s \hookrightarrow L^2$. We further discuss the use of a Wavelet-based implementation of the adjoint operator $E_s^*$ which also allows for efficient evaluations for certain Mat{\'e}rn covariance operators, leading to efficient implementations both in terms of computational effort as well as memory requirements. The proposed methods are validated with reconstructions for the photoacoustic problem.</description>

      <title>A second-order and unconditionally stable time filtered scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose, analyze, and test a novel computational low-complexity, linear, second-order, and unconditional energy-stable semi-discrete time-stepping scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system by employing the time filter technique. Firstly, the first-order semi-implicit backward Euler (BE) method is utilized to discretize the CHNS model; Secondly, the time filter, as a post-processing strategy, is incorporated into the BE scheme, requiring only minimal modifications to the existing BE framework to improve its temporal accuracy from first- to second-order. The unconditional energy stability and second-order temporal error estimations are obtained, and several numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A modified Crank-Nicolson scheme for the Vlasov-Poisson system with a strong external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method based on the Crank-Nicolson time discretization for the Vlasov-Poisson system with a strong and inhomogeneous external magnetic field with fixed direction, where we focus on the motion of particles in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field (so-called poloidal directions). In this regime, the time step can be subject to stability constraints related to the smallness of Larmor radius and plasma frequency [21]. To avoid this limitation, our approach is based on numerical schemes [9, 10, 12], providing a consistent PIC discretization of the guiding-center system taking into account variations of the magnetic field.  We carry out some theoretical proofs and perform several numerical experiments to validate the method and its underlying concepts.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented optimal sensor placement for PDE-constrained inverse problems in crisis management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for goal-oriented optimal static sensor placement and dynamic sensor steering in PDE-constrained inverse problems, utilizing a Bayesian approach accelerated by low-rank approximations. The framework is applied to airborne contaminant tracking, extending recent dynamic sensor steering methods to complex geometries for computational efficiency. A C-optimal design criterion is employed to strategically place sensors, minimizing uncertainty in predictions. Numerical experiments validate the approach's effectiveness for source identification and monitoring, highlighting its potential for real-time decision-making in crisis management scenarios.</description>

      <title>On low-dimensional approximation of function spaces of interior regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many elliptic boundary value problems exhibit an interior regularity property, which can be exploited to construct local approximation spaces that converge exponentially within function spaces satisfying this property. These spaces can be used to define local ansatz spaces within the framework of generalised finite element methods, leading to a better relation between dimensionality and convergence order. In this paper, we present a new technique for the construction of such spaces for Lipschitz domains. Instead of the commonly used approach based on eigenvalue problems it relies on extensions of approximations performed on the boundary. Hence, it improves the influence of the spatial dimension on the exponential convergence and allows to construct the local spaces by solving the original kind of variational problems on easily structured domains.</description>

      <title>High order uniform in time schemes for weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two multiscale numerical schemes for the time integration of weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, built upon the discretization of Picard iterates of the solution. These high-order schemes are designed to achieve high precision with respect to the small nonlinearity parameter under particular CFL condition. By exploiting the scattering properties of these schemes thanks to a low-frequency projected linear flow, we also establish its uniform accuracy over long time horizons. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results, and these schemes are further applied to investigate dynamics in the framework of wave turbulence.</description>

      <title>Moments, Time-Inversion and Source Identification for the Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A $\mathcal{CR}$-rotated $Q_1$ nonconforming finite element method for Stokes interface problems on local anisotropic fitted mixed meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new nonconforming finite element method for solving Stokes interface problems. The method is constructed on local anisotropic mixed meshes, which are generated by fitting the interface through simple connection of intersection points on an interface-unfitted background mesh, as introduced in \cite{Hu2021optimal}. For triangular elements, we employ the standard $\mathcal{CR}$ element; for quadrilateral elements, a new rotated $Q_1$-type element is used. We prove that this rotated $Q_1$ element remains unisolvent and stable even on degenerate quadrilateral elements. Based on these properties, we further show that the space pair of $\mathcal{CR}$-rotated $Q_1$ elements (for velocity) and piecewise $P_0$ spaces (for pressure) satisfies the inf-sup condition without requiring any stabilization terms. As established in our previous work \cite{Wang2025nonconforming}, the consistency error achieves the optimal convergence order without the need for penalty terms to control it. Finally, several numerical examples are provided to verify our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Uniform semiclassical observable error bound of Trotterization without the Egorov theorem: a simple algebraic proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation has garnered significant attention in the numerical analysis community. While controlling the error in the unitary evolution or the wavefunction typically requires the time step size to shrink as the semiclassical parameter $h$ decreases, it has been observed -- and proved for first- and second-order Trotterization schemes -- that the error in certain classes of observables admits a time step size independent of $h$. In this work, we explicitly characterize this class of observables and present a new, simple algebraic proof of uniform-in-$h$ error bounds for arbitrarily high-order Trotterization schemes. Our proof relies solely on the algebraic structure of the underlying operators in both the continuous and discrete settings. Unlike previous analyses, it avoids Egorov-type theorems and bypasses heavy semiclassical machinery. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of uniform-in-$h$ observable error bounds for Trotterization in the semiclassical regime that relies only on algebraic structure, without invoking the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Block triangular preconditioning for inverse source problems in time-space fractional diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work investigates the effectiveness of block triangular preconditioners in accelerating and stabilizing the numerical solution of inverse source problems governed by time-space fractional diffusion equations (TSFDEs). We focus on the recovery of an unknown spatial source function in a multi-dimensional TSFDE, incorporating Caputo time-fractional derivatives and the fractional Laplacian. The inherent ill-posedness is addressed via a quasi-boundary value regularization, followed by a finite difference discretization that leads to large, structured linear systems. We develop and analyze a block triangular preconditioning strategy that mimics the coefficient matrix, while simplifying its structure for computational efficiency. Numerical experiments using the GMRES solver demonstrate that the proposed preconditioner significantly improve convergence rates, robustness, and accuracy, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-world inverse problems involving fractional modeling.</description>

      <title>Hybrid least squares for learning functions from highly noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations, we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification, leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem in computational finance.</description>

      <title>Time Resolution Independent Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately learning solution operators for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) from sparse and irregular data remains a challenging task. Recurrent DeepONet extensions inherit the discrete-time limitations of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) RNN architectures, while neural-ODE surrogates cannot incorporate new inputs after initialization. We introduce NCDE-DeepONet, a continuous-time operator network that embeds a Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) in the branch and augments the trunk with explicit space-time coordinates. The NCDE encodes an entire load history as the solution of a controlled ODE driven by a spline-interpolated input path, making the representation input-resolution-independent: it encodes different input signal discretizations of the observed samples. The trunk then probes this latent path at arbitrary spatial locations and times, rendering the overall map output-resolution independent: predictions can be queried on meshes and time steps unseen during training without retraining or interpolation. Benchmarks on transient Poisson, elastodynamic, and thermoelastic problems confirm the robustness and accuracy of the framework, achieving almost instant solution prediction. These findings suggest that controlled dynamics provide a principled and efficient foundation for high-fidelity operator learning in transient mechanics.</description>

      <title>A Model-Consistent Data-Driven Computational Strategy for PDE Joint Inversion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of simultaneously reconstructing multiple physical coefficients in partial differential equations (PDEs) from observed data is ubiquitous in applications. In this work, we propose an integrated data-driven and model-based iterative reconstruction framework for such joint inversion problems where additional data on the unknown coefficients are supplemented for better reconstructions. Our method couples the supplementary data with the PDE model to make the data-driven modeling process consistent with the model-based reconstruction procedure. We characterize the impact of learning uncertainty on the joint inversion results for two typical inverse problems. Numerical evidence is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of using data-driven models to improve the joint inversion of multiple coefficients in PDEs.</description>

      <title>Rational function approximation with normalized positive denominators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the introduction and development of extremely fast rational function algorithms. Many ideas in this realm arose from polynomial-based linear-algebraic algorithms. However, polynomial approximation is occasionally ill-suited to specific challenging tasks arising in several situations. Some occasions require maximal efficiency in the number of encoding parameters whilst retaining the renowned accuracy of polynomial-based approximation. One application comes from promoting empirical pointwise functions to sparse matrix operators. Rational function approximations provide a simple but flexible alternative (actually a superset), allowing one to capture complex non-linearities. However, these come with extra challenges: i) coping with singularities and near singularities arising from a vanishing denominator, and ii) a non-uniqueness owing to a simultaneous renormalization of both numerator and denominator.
  We, therefore, introduce a new rational function framework using manifestly positive and normalized Bernstein polynomials for the denominator and any traditional polynomial basis (e.g., Chebyshev) for the numerator. While an expressly non-singular approximation slightly reduces the maximum degree of compression, it keeps all the benefits of rational functions while maintaining the flexibility and robustness of polynomials. We illustrate the relevant aspects of this approach with a series of derivations and computational examples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations -- unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method (i) eliminates memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations by orders of magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes adaptive probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Algebraic Reuse of Reordering in Cholesky Factorization with Dynamic Sparsity Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cholesky linear solvers are a critical bottleneck in challenging applications within computer graphics and scientific computing. These applications include but are not limited to elastodynamic barrier methods such as Incremental Potential Contact (IPC), and geometric operations such as remeshing and morphology. In these contexts, the sparsity patterns of the linear systems frequently change across successive calls to the Cholesky solver, necessitating repeated symbolic analyses that dominate the overall solver runtime.
  To address this bottleneck, we evaluate our method on over 150,000 linear systems generated from diverse nonlinear problems with dynamic sparsity changes in Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) and patch remeshing on a wide range of triangular meshes of various sizes. Our analysis using three leading sparse Cholesky libraries, Intel MKL Pardiso, SuiteSparse CHOLMOD, and Apple Accelerate, reveals that the primary performance constraint lies in the symbolic re-ordering phase of the solver. Recognizing this, we introduce Parth, an innovative re-ordering method designed to update ordering vectors only where local connectivity changes occur adaptively. Parth employs a novel hierarchical graph decomposition algorithm to break down the dual graph of the input matrix into fine-grained subgraphs, facilitating the selective reuse of fill-reducing orderings when sparsity patterns exhibit temporal coherence.
  Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that Parth achieves up to a 255x and 13x speedup in fill-reducing ordering for our IPC and remeshing benchmark and a 6.85x and 10.7x acceleration in symbolic analysis. These enhancements translate to up to 2.95x and 5.89x reduction in overall solver runtime. Additionally, Parth's integration requires only three lines of code, resulting in significant computational savings without the requirement of changes to the computational stack.</description>

      <title>A variational symplectic scheme based on Lobatto's quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variational integrator based on the Lobatto quadrature for the time integration of dynamical systems issued from the least action principle. This numerical method uses a cubic interpolation of the states and the action is approximated at each time step by Lobatto's formula. Numerical analysis is performed on both a harmonic oscillator and a nonlinear pendulum. The geometric scheme is conditionally stable, sixth-order accurate, and symplectic. It preserves an approximate energy quantity. Simulation results illustrate the performance and the superconvergence of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An approximation theory for Markov chain compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the compression of reversible Markov chains with rigorous error control. Given a subset of selected states, we construct reduced dynamics that can be lifted to an approximation of the full dynamics, and we prove simple spectral and nuclear norm bounds on the recovery error in terms of a suitably interpreted Nystr\"{o}m approximation error. We introduce two compression schemes: a projective compression based on committor functions and a structure-preserving compression defined in terms of an induced Markov chain over the selected states. The Nystr\"{o}m error appearing in our bounds can be controlled using recent results on column subset selection by nuclear maximization. Numerical experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Low-rank optimization methods based on projected-projected gradient descent that accumulate at Bouligand stationary points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of minimizing a differentiable function with locally Lipschitz continuous gradient on the algebraic variety of real matrices of upper-bounded rank. This problem is known to enable the formulation of various machine learning or signal processing tasks such as dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, and signal recovery. Several definitions of stationarity exist for this nonconvex problem. Among them, Bouligand stationarity is the strongest necessary condition for local optimality. This paper proposes two first-order methods that generate a sequence in the variety whose accumulation points are Bouligand stationary. The first method combines the well-known projected-projected gradient descent map with a rank reduction mechanism. The second method is a hybrid of projected gradient descent and projected-projected gradient descent. Both methods stand out in the field of low-rank optimization methods when considering their convergence properties, their streamlined design, their typical computational cost per iteration, and their empirically observed numerical performance. The theoretical framework used to analyze the proposed methods is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We propose a natural intrinsic extension of the ridge regression from Euclidean spaces to general manifolds, which relies on Riemannian least-squares fitting, empirical covariance, and Mahalanobis distance.

      <title>A physics informed neural network approach to simulating ice dynamics governed by the shallow ice approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we develop a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach to simulate ice sheet dynamics governed by the Shallow Ice Approximation. This problem takes the form of a time-dependent parabolic obstacle problem. Prior work has used this approach to address the stationary obstacle problem and here we extend it to the time dependent problem. Through comprehensive 1D and 2D simulations, we validate the model's effectiveness in capturing complex free-boundary conditions. By merging traditional mathematical modeling with cutting-edge deep learning methods, this approach provides a scalable and robust solution for predicting temporal variations in ice thickness. To illustrate this approach in a real world setting, we simulate the dynamics of the Devon Ice Cap, incorporating aerogeophysical data from 2000 and 2018.</description>
