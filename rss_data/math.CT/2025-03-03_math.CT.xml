      <title>Abelian objects in categories with normal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that in (regular) unital and in subtractive categories, internal abelian groups are simply behaved; e.g., they are the same as internal algebras $(A,s)$ satisfying $s(x,0)=x$ and $s(x,x)=0$, i.e., \emph{subtraction algebras}. Moreover, in these categorical settings, such internal abelian group structures are unique, and every morphism between the underlying objects of internal abelian groups is necessarily a morphism of internal abelian groups. It is also known that both (regular) unital and subtractive categories have normal projections, i.e., the isomorphism formula $(X\times Y)/Y\approx X$ holds. In this paper, we show that all properties of simple behaviour of internal abelian groups in unital and subtractive categories lift to arbitrary categories having normal projections</description>

      <title>Ultracategories as colax algebras for a pseudo-monad on CAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a result inspired by a conjecture by Shulman claiming that ultracategories as defined by Lurie are normal colax algebras for a certain pseudo-monad on the category of categories CAT. Such definition allows us to regard left and right ultrafunctors as defined by Lurie as instances of lax/colax algebras morphisms</description>

      <title>Pullbacks in tangent categories and tangent display maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In differential geometry, the existence of pullbacks is a delicate matter, since the category of smooth manifolds does not admit all of them. When pullbacks are required, often submersions are employed as an ideal class of maps which behaves well under this operation and the tangent bundle functor. This issue is reflected in tangent category theory, which aims to axiomatize the tangent bundle functor of differential geometry categorically. Key constructions such as connections, tangent fibrations, or reverse tangent categories require one to work with pullbacks preserved by the tangent bundle functor. In previous work, this issue has been left as a technicality and solved by introducing extra structure to carry around. This paper gives an alternative to this by focusing on a special class of maps in a tangent category called tangent display maps; such maps are well-behaved with respect to pullbacks and applications of the tangent functor. We develop some of the general theory of such maps, show how using them can simplify previous work in tangent categories, and show that in the tangent category of smooth manifolds, they are the same as the submersions. Finally, we consider a subclass of tangent display maps to define open subobjects in any tangent category, allowing one to build a canonical split restriction tangent category in which the original one naturally embeds.</description>

      <title>On the triangulated structure of stable monomorphism categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the triangulated structure of stable monomorphism categories (filtered chain categories) over a Frobenius category. The high degree of symmetry of linear quivers leads to a plethora of semiorthogonal decompositions into smaller categories of the same type. These form polygons of recollements, in which a full turn of mutations is a power of a particular auto-equivalence of the stable monomorphism category. A certain power of this auto-equivalence is the square of the suspension functor. We describe the infinite chains of adjoint pairs obtained from the polygons. As an application, we explicate the construction of Bondal and Kapranov for lifting representing objects of dualized hom-functors in our setup.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck construction for delta lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delta lenses are functors equipped with a functorial choice of lifts, generalising the notion of split opfibration. In this paper, we introduce a Grothendieck construction (or category of elements) for delta lenses, thus demonstrating a correspondence between delta lenses and certain lax double functors into the double category of sets, functions, and split multivalued functions. We show that the double category of split multivalued functions admits a universal property as a certain kind of limit, and inherits many nice properties from the double category of spans. Applications of this construction to the theory of delta lenses are explored in detail.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.</description>

      <title>About Hopf braces and crossed products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present article represents a step forward in the study of the following problem: If $\mathbb{A}=(A_{1},A_{2})$ and $\mathbb{H}=(H_{1},H_{2})$ are Hopf braces in a symmetric monoidal category C such that $(A_{1},H_{1})$ and $(A_{2},H_{2})$ are matched pairs of Hopf algebras, then we want to know under what conditions the pair $(A_{1}\bowtie H_{1},A_{2}\bowtie H_{2})$ constitutes a new Hopf brace. We find such conditions for the pairs $(A_{1}\otimes H_{1},A_{2}\bowtie H_{2})$ and $(A_{1}\bowtie H_{1},A_{2}\sharp H_{2})$ to be Hopf braces, which are particular situations of the general problem described above, and we apply these results to study when the Drinfeld's Double gives rise to a Hopf brace.</description>

      <title>Higher extension closure and $d$-exact categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any weakly idempotent complete $d$-exact category is equivalent to a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a weakly idempotent complete exact category, and that any weakly idempotent complete algebraic $(d+2)$-angulated category is equivalent to a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of an algebraic triangulated category closed under $d$-shifts. Furthermore, we show that the ambient exact category of a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory is unique up to exact equivalence, assuming it is weakly idempotent complete. This follows from the inclusion of the $d$-cluster tilting subcategory satisfying a universal property. As a consequence of our theory we also get that any $d$-torsion class is $d$-cluster tilting in an extension-closed subcategory, and we recover the fact that any $d$-wide subcategory is $d$-cluster tilting in a unique wide subcategory. In the last part of the paper we rectify the description of the $d$-exact structure of a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a non-weakly idempotent complete exact category.</description>

      <title>Truncated factorized perverse sheaves on Sym(C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kapranov and Schechtman defined the category FP of factorized perverse sheaves on Sym(C) smooth along the stratification given by multiplicities and with values in a braided monoidal category V. We define for each d\in N the category FP^{\leq d} of factorized perverse sheaves on the disjoint union of Sym^n(C) for n\leq d and the category FP_{\leq d} of factorized perverse sheaves on the open subset of Sym(C) consisting of multi-sets with multiplicities bounded by d. We show that the families (FP^{\leq d})_{d in N} and (FP_{\leq d})_{d in N} fit into systems of categories whose inverse limit is FP, and that for each d the natural restriction functor from FP_{\leq d} to FP^{\leq d} is faithful and compatible with taking the limit. For d=1 we prove that the natural restriction functor is an equivalence and that FP^{\leq 1} and FP_{\leq 1} are equivalent to V.</description>

      <title>Definable functors between triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically develop the theory of definable functors between compactly generated triangulated categories. Such functors preserve pure triangles, pure injective objects, and definable subcategories, and as such appear in a wide range of algebraic and topological settings. Firstly we investigate and characterise purity preserving functors from a triangulated category into a finitely accessible category with products, which we term coherent functors. This yields a new property for the restricted Yoneda embedding as the universal coherent functor. We build upon the utility of coherent functors to provide several equivalent conditions for an additive, not necessarily triangulated, functor between triangulated categories to be definable: a functor is definable if and only if it preserves filtered homology colimits and products, if and only if it uniquely extends along the restricted Yoneda embedding to a definable functor between the corresponding module categories. We apply these results to the functoriality of the Ziegler spectrum, an object of study in pure homological algebra and representation theory.</description>
