      <title>Multi-objective Combinatorial Methodology for Nuclear Reactor Site Assessment: A Case Study for the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global demand for clean energy intensifies to achieve sustainability and net-zero carbon emission goals, nuclear energy stands out as a reliable solution. However, fully harnessing its potential requires overcoming key challenges, such as the high capital costs associated with nuclear power plants (NPPs). One promising strategy to mitigate these costs involves repurposing sites with existing infrastructure, including coal power plant (CPP) locations, which offer pre-built facilities and utilities. Additionally, brownfield sites - previously developed or underutilized lands often impacted by industrial activity - present another compelling alternative. These sites typically feature valuable infrastructure that can significantly reduce the costs of NPP development. This study introduces a novel multi-objective optimization methodology, leveraging combinatorial search to evaluate over 30,000 potential NPP sites in the United States. Our approach addresses gaps in the current practice of assigning pre-determined weights to each site attribute that could lead to bias in the ranking. Each site is assigned a performance-based score, derived from a detailed combinatorial analysis of its site attributes. The methodology generates a comprehensive database comprising site locations (inputs), attributes (outputs), site score (outputs), and the contribution of each attribute to the site score (outputs). We then use this database to train a machine learning neural network model, enabling rapid predictions of nuclear siting suitability across any location in the contiguous United States.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of GPU-optimized Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm using Functional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a comparative analysis of GPU-parallelized implementations of the quantum-inspired evolutionary optimization (QIEO) approach and one of the well-known classical metaheuristic techniques, the genetic algorithm (GA). The study assesses the performance of both algorithms on highly non-linear, non-convex, and non-separable function optimization problems, viz., Ackley, Rosenbrock, and Rastrigin, that are representative of the complex real-world optimization problems. The performance of these algorithms is checked by varying the population sizes by keeping all other parameters constant and comparing the fitness value it reached along with the number of function evaluations they required for convergence. The results demonstrate that QIEO performs better for these functions than GA, by achieving the target fitness with fewer function evaluations and significantly reducing the total optimization time approximately three times for the Ackley function and four times for the Rosenbrock and Rastrigin functions. Furthermore, QIEO exhibits greater consistency across trials, with a steady convergence rate that leads to a more uniform number of function evaluations, highlighting its reliability in solving challenging optimization problems. The findings indicate that QIEO is a promising alternative to GA for these kind of functions.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Contact Problems in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle forward problems in 3D contact mechanics, focusing on small deformation elasticity. We utilize a mixed-variable formulation, enhanced with output transformations, to enforce Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions as hard constraints. The inherent inequality constraints in contact mechanics, particularly the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, are addressed as soft constraints by integrating them into the network's loss function. To enforce the KKT conditions, we leverage the nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) approach, specifically using the Fischer-Burmeister function, which is known for its advantageous properties in optimization. We investigate two benchmark examples of PINNs in 3D contact mechanics: a single contact patch test and the Hertzian contact problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on model preparation for electrostatic simulations of CAD designs to realize a rapid virtual prototyping concept. We present a boundary element method (BEM) allowing discontinuous fields between surfaces. The corresponding edges of the CAD model are enhanced with the data required to integrate over non-conforming elements. Finally, we generate a mesh for each CAD surface. The approach is verified via numerical experiments and shows excellent agreement with conforming BEM results.</description>

      <title>Finite-PINN: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture for Solving Solid Mechanics Problems with General Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PINN models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing fluid PDE problems, and their potential in solid mechanics is beginning to emerge. This study identifies two key challenges when using PINN to solve general solid mechanics problems. These challenges become evident when comparing the limitations of PINN with the well-established numerical methods commonly used in solid mechanics, such as the finite element method (FEM). Specifically: a) PINN models generate solutions over an infinite domain, which conflicts with the finite boundaries typical of most solid structures; and b) the solution space utilised by PINN is Euclidean, which is inadequate for addressing the complex geometries often present in solid structures.
  This work proposes a PINN architecture used for general solid mechanics problems, termed the Finite-PINN model. The proposed model aims to effectively address these two challenges while preserving as much of the original implementation of PINN as possible. The unique architecture of the Finite-PINN model addresses these challenges by separating the approximation of stress and displacement fields, and by transforming the solution space from the traditional Euclidean space to a Euclidean-topological joint space. Several case studies presented in this paper demonstrate that the Finite-PINN model provides satisfactory results for a variety of problem types, including both forward and inverse problems, in both 2D and 3D contexts. The developed Finite-PINN model offers a promising tool for addressing general solid mechanics problems, particularly those not yet well-explored in current research.</description>

      <title>Advancing Operational Efficiency: Airspace Users' Perspective on Trajectory-Based Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the evolution of the Flight Operations Center (FOC) and flight trajectory exchange tools within Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO), emphasizing the benefits of the ICAO's Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE) messaging framework and Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs). It highlights the collaborative management of four-dimensional flight trajectories, serving as a common reference for decision-making among stakeholders, including Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), airspace users, and airport operators.
  Key enabling technologies such as Performance Based Navigation (PBN), data communications, and System-wide Information Management (SWIM) are discussed, showcasing their roles in rapid information exchange and trajectory optimization. A live flight case study demonstrates TBO concepts through international collaboration, indicating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and sustainability.
  The paper presents results from TBO prototype implementations, including enhanced trajectory accuracy, improved flight path efficiency, and real-time adjustments based on evolving conditions. The integration of advanced trajectory optimization engines and automation within the FOC has led to more effective flight planning, allowing airlines to negotiate trajectory changes dynamically and optimize operations throughout the flight lifecycle.
  Findings suggest that TBO can enhance operational predictability, flexibility, and strategic planning while reducing uncertainty and improving alignment between strategic and tactical actions. Key conclusions include: TBO is feasible with most currently flying commercial aircraft; full TBO implementation can lead to a greener, more efficient aviation industry with widespread benefits; and continued collaboration among stakeholders is essential for the further development and realization of TBO.</description>

      <title>evS2CP: Real-time Simultaneous Speed and Charging Planner for Connected Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents evS2CP, an optimization-based framework for simultaneous speed and charging planning designed for connected electric vehicles (EVs). With EVs emerging as competitive alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles, overcoming challenges such as limited charging infrastructure is crucial. evS2CP addresses these issues by minimizing the travel time, charging time, and energy consumption, providing practical solutions for both human-operated and autonomous vehicles. This framework leverages V2X communication to integrate essential EV planning data, including route geometry, real-time traffic conditions, and charging station availability, while simulating dynamic driving environments using open-web API services. The speed and charging planning problem was initially formulated as a nonlinear programming model, which was then convexified into a quadratic programming model without charging-stop constraints. Additionally, a mixed-integer programming approach was employed to optimize charging station selection and minimize the frequency of charging events. A mixed-integer quadratic programming implementation exhibited exceptional computational efficiency and scalability, effectively solving trip plans over distances exceeding 700 km in a few seconds. Simulations conducted using open-source and commercial solvers validated the framework's near-global optimality, demonstrating its robustness and feasibility for real-world applications in connected EV ecosystems.</description>

      <title>FUsion-based ConstitutivE model (FuCe): Towards model-data augmentation in constitutive modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constitutive modelling is crucial for engineering design and simulations to accurately describe material behavior. However, traditional phenomenological models often struggle to capture the complexities of real materials under varying stress conditions due to their fixed forms and limited parameters. While recent advances in deep learning have addressed some limitations of classical models, purely data-driven methods tend to require large datasets, lack interpretability, and struggle to generalize beyond their training data. To tackle these issues, we introduce "Fusion-based Constitutive model (FuCe): Towards model-data augmentation in constitutive modelling". This approach combines established phenomenological models with an ICNN architecture, designed to train on the limited and noisy force-displacement data typically available in practical applications. The hybrid model inherently adheres to necessary constitutive conditions. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout is employed to generate Bayesian predictions, providing mean values and confidence intervals that quantify uncertainty. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness by learning two isotropic constitutive models and one anisotropic model with a single fibre direction, across six different stress states. The framework's applicability is also showcased in finite element simulations across three geometries of varying complexities. Our results highlight the framework's superior extrapolation capabilities, even when trained on limited and noisy data, delivering accurate and physically meaningful predictions across all numerical examples.</description>

      <title>TCM-FTP: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Herbal Prescription Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has relied on specific combinations of herbs in prescriptions to treat various symptoms and signs for thousands of years. Predicting TCM prescriptions poses a fascinating technical challenge with significant practical implications. However, this task faces limitations due to the scarcity of high-quality clinical datasets and the complex relationship between symptoms and herbs. To address these issues, we introduce \textit{DigestDS}, a novel dataset comprising practical medical records from experienced experts in digestive system diseases. We also propose a method, TCM-FTP (TCM Fine-Tuning Pre-trained), to leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) via supervised fine-tuning on \textit{DigestDS}. Additionally, we enhance computational efficiency using a low-rank adaptation technique. Moreover, TCM-FTP incorporates data augmentation by permuting herbs within prescriptions, exploiting their order-agnostic nature. Impressively, TCM-FTP achieves an F1-score of 0.8031, significantly outperforming previous methods. Furthermore, it demonstrates remarkable accuracy in dosage prediction, achieving a normalized mean square error of 0.0604. In contrast, LLMs without fine-tuning exhibit poor performance. Although LLMs have demonstrated wide-ranging capabilities, our work underscores the necessity of fine-tuning for TCM prescription prediction and presents an effective way to accomplish this.</description>
