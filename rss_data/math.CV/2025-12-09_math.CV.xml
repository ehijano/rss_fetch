      <title>Horofunction compactifications and local Gromov model domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the horofunction compactification of complete hyperbolic domains in complex Euclidean space equipped with the Kobayashi distance. We provide a sufficient condition under which, given a domain $\Omega$ as above, the identity map from $\Omega$ to itself extends to an embedding of $\overline{\Omega}$ into the horofunction compactification of $(\Omega,k_\Omega)$, with $k_\Omega$ denoting the Kobayashi distance on $\Omega$. Notably, this condition admits unbounded domains that are not Gromov hyperbolic relative to the Kobayashi distance. We also provide a large class of planar hyperbolic domains satisfying the above condition.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional analogues of the improved Bohr's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to establish a sharp improvement of the classical Bohr inequality for bounded holomorphic mappings in the polydisk $\mathbb{P}\Delta(0;1_n)$. We also prove two other sharp versions of the Bohr inequality in the setting of several complex variables by replacing the constant term with the absolute value of the function and the square of the absolute value of the function, respectively. All the results are shown to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Convolution operators preserving the set of totally positive sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real sequence $(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ is called {\it totally positive} if all minors of the infinite Toeplitz matrix $ \left\| a_{j-i} \right\|_{i, j =0}^\infty$ are nonnegative (here $a_k=0$ for $k&lt;0$). In this paper, which continues our earlier work \cite{kv}, we investigate the set of real sequences $(b_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ with the property that for every totally positive sequence $(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty,$ the sequense of termwise products $(a_k b_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ is also totally positive. In particular, we show that for every totally positive sequence $(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ the sequence $\left(a_k a^{-k (k-1)}\right)_{k=0}^\infty$ is totally positive whenever $a^2\geq 3{.}503.$ We also propose several open problems concerning convolution operators that preserve total positivity.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Complex Hessian type equations on compact Hermitian manifolds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to further develop the theory of the degenerate complex Hessian equations on compact Hermitian manifolds. Building upon the generalization of the Bedford-Taylor pluripotential theory to complex Hessian equations by Ko\l odziej-Nguyen, we solve these equations in the $(\omega, m)$-positive cone, $(\omega, m)$-big classes and in nef classes, where $\omega$ is a reference Hermitian metric. These results are also new in the K\"ahler case. Moreover, we adapt our techniques to solve complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in nef classes with mild singularities. The solutions we obtain, in the compact K\"ahler case, coincide with those for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in the sense of the non-pluripolar product introduced by Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi. One of the key ingredients in the proof is the adaption, to the Hermitian setting, of a new a priori $L^\infty$-estimate established by Guo-Phong-Tong and Guo-Phong-Tong-Wang.</description>

      <title>Regular Functions on Formal-Analytic Arithmetic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove for a broad class of pseudo convex formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces, those which admit a nonconstant monic such regular function, a conjecture of Bost-Charles that the ring of regular functions has continuum cardinality. A key feature of the proof is a new formula for the pushforward of the equilibrium Green's functions for our bordered Riemann surface with boundary by a holomorphic function, a formula which has constant term related to Arakelov degree. A Fekete-Sz\"ego-type approximation argument then produces a polynomial "large" relative to the regular function, which in turn yields continuum many distinct regular functions.</description>

      <title>A Newton-Okounkov Body Viewpoint on the SOS Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $z\in \mathbb C^n$ be the complex coordinates on $\mathbb C^n$, and $A(z,\bar z)$ be a real-valued Hermitian polynomial. The famous Ebenfelt's SOS conjecture asks for the minimum rank of $A(z,\bar z)\|z\|^2$ under the restriction that $A(z,\bar z)\|z\|^2$ is an SOS. Assume that $A(z,\bar z)$ is bihomogeneous. In the present note, we establish a connection between Ebenfelt's (Weak) SOS Conjecture and the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies. By reformulating the conjecture in terms of lattice semigroups and their associated Newton-Okounkov convex bodies, we transform the problem of finding the minimal rank of a prolonged sum-of-squares polynomial into an extremal problem in convex geometry. In particular, we prove that this minimal rank is attained at the extreme points of a specific Newton-Okounkov body. Furthermore, if $A(z,\bar z)$ is moreover diagonal, we demonstrate that the relevant extreme points are finitely many rational points, thereby reducing the verification of the conjecture to a computationally tractable problem. This work provides a new tool for attacking the SOS Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Entire Functions on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every Lie group $G$ carries a distinguished algebra of particularly well-behaved real-analytic mappings: The entire functions $\mathcal{E}(G)$. They were introduced for the purposes of strict deformation quantization. This paper establishes a one-to-one correspondence between entire functions and holomorphic mappings $\mathcal{H}(G_\mathbb{C})$ on the universal complexification $G_\mathbb{C}$ of $G$ as Fr\'{e}chet algebras. Methodically, this is achieved by porting aspects of classical complex analysis into a left-invariant guise and by studying the geometry of $G_\mathbb{C}$. As a byproduct, we obtain a strict deformation quantization of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of any universal complexification.</description>

      <title>RationalFunctionApproximation.jl: Rational Approximation On Discrete and Continuous Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike polynomials, rational functions can represent functions having poles or branch cuts with root-exponential convergence and no Runge phenomenon. Recent developments of the AAA and greedy Thiele algorithms have sparked renewed interest in computational rational approximation. The \textsf{RationalFunctionApproximation} package supplies the fastest known implementations of these methods and the only arbitrary-precision ones. Combined with the \textsf{ComplexRegions} package, it can produce compact and accurate representations of a huge variety of functions over intervals, circles, or other domains in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Generalizing quadratic $\mathbb{R}$-Algebraic sets in $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The images of a ball under complex linear transformations are complex ellipsoids. So, they are the unit balls of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces over the complex numbers. The analog of segments in the real line, are discs in the complex line. So, the analog of convex bodies in $\mathbb R^n$ should be what we called ``\emph{bombons}'' in $\mathbb C^n$: bodies whose non-trivial sections with complex lines are disks. Clearly, a complex ellipsoid is a bombon in this sense. We first introduced bombons in \cite{ABM1} motivated by our study of the complex Banach conjecture \cite{BM}; A little later, they turned out to be an unexpected characterization of complex ellipsoids with no analog over the real numbers. Namely, if every complex line that intersects a convex body in $\mathbb C^n$ does so in a disk or a point, then the convex body is a complex ellipsoid. This characterization naturally leads to the main question of this paper. What are those closed sets of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ with the property that any complex line that intersects them does so either at a single point, at the boundary of a complex disk, or along the entire line?</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Carleson measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a general construction of a quaternionic Banach space of slice regular functions from a given Banach space of holomorphic functions, which we call its quaternionic lift. To the best of our knowledge, this construction encompasses all known examples of quaternionic Banach spaces of slice regular functions in the literature. Our main result is a characterization of Carleson and vanishing Carleson measures for such quaternionic Banach function spaces in terms of the corresponding Carleson measures of the underlying holomorphic function space. This offers a unified approach to a problem that so far has been treated on a case-by-case basis.</description>

      <title>Discrete Contact Angles and Electric Field Singularity in Electrowetting: A Multi-Scale Complex Potential Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study constructed a multi-scale theoretical framework to resolve the electric field singularity at the Triple Contact Point in electrowetting. Utilizing conformal transformation and complex analysis, we established the structure for both the global potential and local field solutions, complementing the analysis with numerical methods. Our primary finding is that the contact angle $\theta$ is not continuously adjustable but is restricted to a discrete set of values, constrained by the characteristic exponent $\lambda$. Analysis of the complex potential established $\text{Re}[\lambda] \ge 1$ as the critical condition for a non-singular electric field; conversely, singular solutions ($\text{Re}[\lambda] &lt; 1$) are localized exclusively in the acute-angle regime ($\theta &lt; \pi/2$). The high-order solution region exhibits a degeneracy phenomenon at specific angles, implying the local field structure is geometrically stable and universally applicable for a wide range of permittivity ratios $k$. Furthermore, we determined that the onset of electric field oscillation requires the simultaneous satisfaction of two critical conditions: the geometry must approach a flat boundary ($\theta \to \pi$) and the dielectric ratio must approach homogeneity ($k \to 1$). These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for designing non-singular electric fields and mitigating the common contact angle saturation phenomenon.</description>
