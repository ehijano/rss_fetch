      <title>Demonstration of a planar multimodal periodic filter at THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a planar multimodal periodic filter that is constructed from alternating sections of coplanar stripline and the odd-mode of a finite-ground plane coplanar waveguide constructed on a 1 um silicon nitride substrate to facilitate operation at THz frequencies. The multimode configuration differs from standard single-mode periodic filters and enables flexible designs and the possibility for active control of the filter characteristics. For this proof-of-concept, we present the relevant theory and design procedures required to develop a band-stop filter that has a center frequency of fc = 0.8 THz and a bandwidth of df = 0.07 THz. We find good agreement between theory, simulation, and experiment.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Material Based Photodetector for Near Infrared Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing new materials as alternative to silicon for application in photonic devices has been the center of attention in the scientific community. Two-Dimensional (2D) materials have shown a great capacity to be next alternative to remedy this impediment. Graphene due to its unique properties such as high mobility and optical transparency, in addition to flexibility, robustness and environmental stability is amongst 2D materials to shine in photonics and optoelectronics. Several graphene-based photodetectors with ability to integrate with various energy thermoelectric, electromagnetic and piezoelectric devices is reported. However, pristine graphene is not suitable to detect reasonable signals in infrared region, due to its bandgap limitation. In this work, a graphene based near infrared detection is demonstrated using graphene/metal intercalated graphene photodetector. The intercalated graphene was grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Cu substrate and wet transfer of the layers to the Si/SiO2 substrate. A tapered aluminum microelectrode has been used for the electrical contacts to improve the detection of photogenerated carriers during the illumination. The infrared detection was demonstrated, responsivity and quantum efficiency was tested at room temperature and the mechanism of photogeneration was explained.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Characterize Charge Transport and Hysteresis in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology, already achieving efficiencies surpassing 25%. However, effects such as hysteresis are commonly observed due to the interplay of ionic and electronic transport occurring over different timescales. Despite the widespread use of impedance spectroscopy (IS), physical interpretation in PSCs is specially challenging due to memory effects. In this study, we focus on integrating experimental data with an analytical device transport model. The PSCs under investigation were fabricated using a Cs$_{0.17}$FA$_{0.83}$Pb(I$_{0.83}$Br$_{0.17}$)$_3$ active layer between Nb$_2$O$_5$/TiO$_2$ (compact/mesoporous) and Spiro-OMeTAD. Our fully analytical charge transport model incorporates independent charge transport channels, enabling the correlation of experimental observations in both dark and under illumination. We employed IS together with various voltammetry techniques to reveal the dynamics of the transport processes, including voltage pulses and both small and large amplitude sinusoidal excitations. Although small perturbations are commonly used in IS, our findings demonstrate that large sinusoidal excitation provides new valuable insights in the transition from capacitive to inductive-like responses. The proposed model based purely on charge trapping and generation effectively captures device behavior under both small and large voltages without inductive elements, validated through accurate simulations of hysteresis and other electrical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Accelerated engineering of topological interface states in one-dimensional phononic crystals via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological interface states (TISs) in phononic crystals (PnCs) are robust acoustic modes against external perturbations, which are of great significance in scientific and engineering communities. However, designing a pair of PnCs with specified band gaps (BGs) and TIS frequency remains a challenging problem. In this work, deep learning (DL) approaches are used for the engineering of one-dimensional (1D) PnCs with high design freedoms. The considered 1D PnCs are composed of periodic solid scatterers embedded in the air background, whose unit cell is divided into a matrix with 32 * 32 pixels. First, the variational autoencoder is applied to reduce the dimensionality of unit cell images, allowing accurate reconstruction of PnC images with different numbers of scatterers. Subsequently, the multilayer perceptron and the tandem neural network are used to realize the property prediction and customized design of 1D PnCs, respectively. The correlation coefficients for the property prediction and inverse design are more than 97%. The unit cell images of 1D PnCs with specific BG properties could be successfully and instantaneously designed. Importantly, the implementation of a "one-to-many" design of PnC pairs with specific TIS frequencies is realized. Furthermore, the reliability and robustness of the constructed networks are confirmed by randomly specifying the design targets as well as the experimental verification. This study demonstrates the broad application prospects of DL approaches in the field of PnC design and provides new ideas and methods for the intelligent design of artificially functional materials.</description>

      <title>Toward Carnot efficient high output power heat engines using bubbly two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic gas power cycles achieving Carnot efficiency require isothermal expansion, which is associated with slow processes and results in negligible power output. This study proposes a practical method for rapid near-isothermal gas expansion, facilitating efficient heat engines without sacrificing power. The method involves bubble expansion in a heat transfer liquid, ensuring efficient and near-isothermal heat exchange. The mixture is accelerated through a converging-diverging nozzle, converting thermal energy into kinetic energy. A novel organic vapor cycle employing isothermal expansion utilizing these nozzles is suggested to harness low-grade heat sources. Nozzle experiments with air and water yielded a polytropic index &lt;1.052, enabling up to 71% more work extraction than adiabatic expansion. Simulations on a small-scale heat engine indicate that utilizing these nozzles for thrust generation decreases heat transfer irreversibilities in the cycle, consequently resulting in up to 19% higher power output than the organic Rankine cycle using Pentane. This work paves the way for an efficient and high-power heat-to-power solution.</description>

      <title>Planar 3$\omega$ and 2$\omega$ Method for Increased Sensitivity to Through-Plane Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately measuring the thermal properties of buried interfaces is crucial for understanding heat transport in multilayered materials, particularly in applications such as batteries and integrated circuits. The conventional 3$\omega$ method, which uses a line heater, has limited sensitivity to through-plane thermal properties due to lateral heat spreading, especially when a highly conductive layer overlays a resistive one. Additionally, when using a line heater, there is a lower limit to the frequency of heating, below which the analytical solution assuming infinite lateral dimension is not valid. This limits analytical interpretation of 2$\omega$ temperature oscillation at lower frequencies where the sensitivity to the conductivity of a buried layer is greater. To overcome these limitations, we propose a planar 3$\omega$ and 2$\omega$ method that enhances the sensitivity to buried layers by ensuring planar heat flow. We implement this technique using a planar metallic heater across the entire sample and validate it experimentally against the analytical solution using Feldman's algorithm. We also discuss the practical implementation details of the approach, including ensuring uniform current distribution and the required sensor layout. Our results demonstrate improved measurement sensitivity for polymer layers in silicon stacks and buried interfaces in battery electrodes, with sensitivity improvements by factors of 2-5 compared to conventional technique using a line heater.</description>

      <title>A novel method to determine the layer number of 2D TMD materials based on Optical Microscopy and Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dicakcoganite (TMD) materials have unique electronic and optical properties. The electronic band structures of the materials alter as a function of layer numbers, which results in modifications to the whole characteristic properties. Therefore, the determination of the layer number is crucial for optoelectronic applications. In this study, a fast and easily applicable method is proposed for determining the layer number of two-dimensional TMD materials by using an optical microscopy and computatial methods. The method uses image processing techniques on digital images taken with a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) camera under a conventional reflecting microscope. The chromaticity differences and lightness difference in International Commission on Illumination (Commission internationale de ,CIE) Luv color space values between the layered areas on the flakes and substrates are used together to train the model to be identified the layer numbers of the materials and corrected via photoluminescence spectroscopy. The random forest clasifier algorithm is applied to predict layer numbers on unknown materials. This approach provides high accuracy under varying microscope configurations such as brightnesses, gain etc. and material-substrate combinations. From ML to bulk whole layers numbers of MoS2, WSe2 and WS2 flakes are determined with high accuracy by training only a single flake of each has various layer numbers. Compared with traditional methods such as Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoluminescence (PL), our method is not only faster but also easier to apply. Moreover, unlike the prominent methods in the literature such as machine learning or clustering-based, it requires only single training for a material/substrate combination and further accelerates the processes.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stability of Skyrmion Tubes in Nanostructured Cuboids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in bulk materials are typically regarded as two-dimensional structures. However, they also exhibit three-dimensional configurations, known as skyrmion tubes, which elongate and extend in-depth. Understanding the configurations and stabilization mechanism of skyrmion tubes is crucial for the development of advanced spintronic devices. However, the generation and annihilation of skyrmion tubes in confined geometries are still rarely reported. Here, we present direct imaging of skyrmion tubes in nanostructured cuboids of a chiral magnet FeGe using Lorentz transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), while applying an in-plane magnetic field. It is observed that skyrmion tubes stabilize in a narrow field-temperature region near the Curie temperature (Tc). Through a field cooling process, metastable skyrmion tubes can exist in a larger region of the field-temperature diagram. Combining these experimental findings with micromagnetic simulations, we attribute these phenomena to energy differences and thermal fluctuations. Our results could promote topological spintronic devices based on skyrmion tubes.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic diamond network as an efficient spin filter: Proposition of a spin-specific semi-conducting behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin filtration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due to the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type semiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.</description>

Abstract: Using GHz repetition rate pulses in burst mode has demonstrated numerous advantages for highly efficient material removal. In this work, we present high-speed (over 100 kHz) micro-laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (micro-LIBS) with ultra-low pulse energies in the range of 10-200 nJ using our recently developed 2.8 GHz burst-mode Yb-doped fiber laser. We delivered 40 ps-long pulses to the sample with a beam diameter of about 18 microns. A systematic LIBS study was conducted on stainless steel (SS) at different burst durations and burst energies to study their effects on the optical emission spectrum. Finally, the electron temperature and electron density were determined using the Boltzmann plot method and Stark-broadened line profile analysis, respectively.</description>

      <title>Locally-sealed microfabricated vapor cells filled from an ex situ Cs source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microfabricated alkali vapor cells are key to enable miniature devices such as atomic clocks and optically pumped magnetometers with reduced size, weight and power. Yet, more versatile fabrication methods are still needed to further expand their use cases. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to collectively fill and seal microfabricated cesium cells using locally-sealed microchannels patterned within one of the glass substrates comprising the cells. Unlike current methods that rely on wafer-level anodic bonding as the last sealing step, an approach based on local sealing opens the path to features so far limited to traditional glass-blown cells, including the ability to deposit temperature-sensitive antirelaxation coatings, reaching lower background gas pressure without an additional gettering material or filling with diverse atomic or molecular species.</description>

      <title>Imaging current flow and injection in scalable graphene devices through NV-magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global electronic properties of solid-state devices are strongly affected by the microscopic spatial paths of charge carriers. Visualising these paths in novel devices produced by scalable processes would provide a quality assessment method that can propel the device performance metrics towards commercial use. Here, we use high-resolution nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry to visualise the charge flow in gold-contacted, single-layer graphene devices produced by scalable methods. Modulating the majority carrier type via field effect reveals a strong asymmetry between the spatial current distributions in the electron and hole regimes that we attribute to an inhomogeneous microscopic potential landscape, inaccessible to conventional measurement techniques. In addition, we observe large, unexpected, differences in charge flow through nominally identical gold-graphene contacts. Moreover, we find that the current transfer into the graphene occurs several microns before the metal contact edge. Our findings establish high-resolution NV-magnetometry as a key tool for characterizing scalable 2D material based devices, uncovering quality deficits of the material, substrate, and electrical contacts that are invisible to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Triaxial Alignment Magnetometer Utilizing Free-Spin Precession in the Geomagnetic Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a triaxial alignment magnetometer based on free-spin precession deployed in the geomagnetic range. Existing vector measurement methods often require complex optical setups, heating structures, and laser modulation. This study addresses this challenge by employing a linearly polarized probe beam to induce atomic alignment and subsequently detecting the optical polarization rotation caused by the pulsed radio frequency field. The experiment is conducted in a paraffin-coated cell without buffer gas at room temperature, containing rubidium with natural abundance. We report triaxial measurements with a static magnetic field amplitude of approximately 50 $\mu{\text{T}}$ (close to Earth's magnetic field), where the noise levels for each axis are approximately 5.3 ${\text{pT/}}\sqrt{{\text{Hz}}}$, 4.7 ${\text{pT/}}\sqrt{{\text{Hz}}}$, and 9.3 ${\text{pT/}}\sqrt{{\text{Hz}}}$ respectively. The proposed method demonstrates a simple structure suitable for cost-effective and versatile applications.</description>

      <title>Phase-change materials for volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal oscillations in phase-change materials, specifically those undergoing metal-to-insulator and charge density wave transitions, offer unique attributes such as fast and low-field volatile switching, tunability, and non-linear behaviors. These characteristics are particularly promising for emulating neuronal behavior and thus hold great potential for realizing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of neuronal oscillator devices based on three archetypal electronic phase-change materials: the correlated oxide VO2, the charge density wave transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, and the emerging phase-change chalcogenide perovskite BaTiS3. We discuss progress from the perspective of materials development, including structural phase transitions, synthesis methods, electrical properties, and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>New insights into crystallographic relation and lattice dynamics effects in {CdO/MgO} superlattices grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11754</link>

Abstract: This article explores the structural properties of molecular beam epitaxy grown {CdO/MgO} superlattices on sapphire substrates of different crystallographic orientations (a-, c-, r-, and m-plane). The investigations involve a comprehensive analysis using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution X-ray diffraction studies unveil a significant influence of surface symmetry on both the substrates and the epitaxial layers, particularly with respect to the occurrence of twins in the superlattices. Remarkably, no twins are observed on r-oriented sapphire substrates, resulting in improved interface and crystallographic quality. The results of studies demonstrated in this work show that the growth rate of CdO sublayers within {CdO/MgO} superlattices is intricately dependent on the substrate orientation. Notably, the c-plane and m-plane sapphire substrates yielded thicker CdO sublayers, indicating comparable growth rates for these crystallographic orientations. Conversely, the a-plane and r-plane orientations seemed to favor a slower growth rate of CdO sublayers.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of String Oscillation in Subharmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lowest notes produced by string instruments are typically limited by the fundamental vibration of the strings. However, precise control of bow pressure can lead to the production of even lower notes. Despite significant interest in this counterintuitive technique and various proposed explanations, no conclusive evidence has been provided, making detailed discussions of the underlying mechanism challenging. In this study, we employ high-speed imaging to visualize the spatial vibration modes of stringed instruments, confirming Helmholtz motion and its modifications under subharmonic conditions. Finite element simulations further demonstrated that increased bow pressure amplifies frictional forces, suppressing standard vibrations and allowing subharmonic frequencies to emerge. Our results provide the clear experimental validation of the mechanism underlying subharmonic sound production, providing an avenue for further exploration of vibrational and oscillatory phenomena.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of machine learning techniques for conditional generative adversarial networks in inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning has been introduced in the inverse design of physical devices, i.e., the automatic generation of device geometries for a desired physical response. In particular, generative adversarial networks have been proposed as a promising approach for topological optimization, since such neural network models can perform free-form design and simultaneously take into account constraints imposed by the device's fabrication process. In this context, a plethora of techniques has been developed in the machine learning community. Here, we study to what extent new network architectures, such as dense residual networks, and other techniques like data augmentation, and the use of noise in the input channels of the discriminator can improve or speed up neural networks for inverse design of optical metasurfaces. We also investigate strategies for improving the convergence of the training of generative adversarial networks for inverse design, e.g., temporarily freezing the discriminator weights when the model outperforms the generator and training data blurring during the early epochs. Our results show that only some of these techniques improve inverse design models in terms of accuracy and stability, but also that a combination of them can provide more efficient and robust metasurface designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of superconducting applications containing windings of superconducting wires or tapes requires electro-thermal quench modelling. In this article, we present a reliable numerical method based on a variational principle and we benchmark it to a conventional finite difference method that we implemented in C++. As benchmark problem, we consider a racetrack coil made of REBCO superconducting tape under short circuit, approximated as a DC voltage that appears at the initial time. Results show that both models agree with each other and analytical limits. Since both models take screening currents into account, they are promising for the design of magnets (especially fast-ramp magnets) and power applications, such as the stator windings of superconducting motors or generators.</description>

      <title>Creation of super-high-flux photo-neutrons and gamma-rays &gt; 8 MeV using a petawatt laser to irradiate high-Z solid targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the creation of super-high-flux gamma-rays with energy &gt;8 MeV and photo-neutrons via the (g,n) reaction near giant dipole resonance energies (8 - 20 MeV), using the ~130 J Texas Petawatt laser to irradiate high-Z (Au, Pt, Re, W) targets of mm - cm thickness, at laser intensities up to ~5x1021W/cm2. We detected up to ~ several x 1012 gamma-rays &gt; 8 MeV (~3% of incident laser energy) and ~ 1010 photo-neutrons per shot. Due to the short pulse and narrow gamma-ray cone (~17o half-width) around laser forward, the peak emergent gamma-ray flux &gt;8 MeV reached ~1027 gammas/cm2/sec, and the peak emergent neutron flux reached ~1020 neutrons/cm2/sec. Such intense gamma-ray and neutron fluxes are among the highest achieved for short-pulse laser experiments. They will facilitate the study of nuclear reactions requiring super-high-flux of gamma-rays or neutrons, such as the creation of r-process elements. These results may also have far-reaching applications for nuclear energy, such as the transmutation of nuclear waste, isotope production and inertial fusion.</description>

      <title>Towards mutual synchronization of serially connected Spin Torque Oscillators based on magnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple neuromorphic applications require the tuning of two or more devices to a common signal. Various types of neuromorphic computation can be realized using spintronic oscillators, where the DC current induces magnetization precession, which turns into an AC voltage generator. However, in spintronics, synchronization of two oscillators using a DC signal is still a challenging problem because it requires a certain degree of similarity between devices that are to be synchronized, which may be difficult to achieve due to device parameter distribution during the fabrication process. In this work, we present experimental results on the mechanisms of synchronization of spin-torque oscillators. Devices are based on magnetic tunnel junction with a perpendicularly magnetized free layer and take advantage of a uniform magnetization precision in the presence of the magnetic field and a DC bias. By using an external microwave source, we show the optimal condition for the synchronization of the magnetic tunnel junctions. Finally, we present results on the in-series connection of two junctions and discuss the possible path towards improving oscillation power and linewidth. In addition, using numerical simulations of the coupled oscillators model, we aim to reproduce the conditions of the experiments and determine the tolerance for achieving synchronization.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate electromagnetic modeling of non-insulated and metal-insulated REBCO magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: REBCO high-temperature superconductors are promising for fully superconducting high-field magnets, including ultra-high field magnets. Non-insulated (NI) and metal-insulated (MI) windings are a good solution for protection against electro-thermal quench. Design and optimization requires numerical modelling of REBCO inserts for high-field magnets. Here, we detail a fast and accurate two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional model for the electromagnetic response of NI and MI coils, which is based on the Minimum Electro Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP). Benchmarking with an $A-V$ formulation method on a double pancake coil shows good agreement. We also analyse a fully superconducting 32 T magnet with a REBCO insert and a low-temperature superconducing (LTS) outsert. In particular, we analyze the current density, the screening curren induced field (SCIF), and the AC loss. We have shown that metal-insulated coils enable transfer of angular current in the radial direction, and hence magnet protection, while keeping the same screening currents and AC loss of isolated coils, even at relatively high ramp rates of 1 A/s. Surprisingly, soldered coils with low resistance between turns present relatively low AC loss for over-current configuration, which might enable higher generated magnetic fields. The numerical method presented here can be applied to optimize high-field magnets regarding SCIF in MI or NI magnets. It also serves as the basis for future electro-thermal modelling and multi-physics modeling that also includes mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Impact of Annealing and Nanostructuring on Properties of NV Centers Created by Different Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds have been an epicenter of research for diverse applications in quantum technologies. It is therefore imperative that their fabrication techniques are well understood and characterized for the technological scalability of these applications. A comparative study of the optical and spin properties of NVs created by ion implantation and chemical vapor deposition delta-doping is thus presented, combined with an investigation on the impact of annealing in vacuum at different temperatures. In addition, nanopillars are fabricated with electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching for enhanced photon collection efficiency. An extensive combination of characterization techniques is employed. Notably, the smallest nanopillars present fluorescence enhancements of factor around 50, compared to the unstructured regions. Annealing is also demonstrated to increase the optical contrast between the NVs' electronic states, the coherence and relaxation times both in bulk as in pillars. Regarding the NV preparation technique, the delta-doping is shown to create NVs with less lattice defects and strain compared to implantation.</description>

      <title>Object kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on the difference between fission neutron and heavy ion irradiation induced void evolution in Fe-Cr alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental results show significant difference between neutrons and ions irradiation of alloys, while the underlying reasons remain unclear. Herein, we performed object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) simulations on void evolution in Fe-Cr alloys under neutron and ion irradiations, focusing on the effects of dose rate, irradiation particle type and temperature. Binary Collision Approximation and Molecular Dynamics are applied to obtain the cascade morphology of ion irradiation in order to study the effect of spatial correlation of cascades along the ion track, which is considered as a significant difference between the neutron and ion irradiations. Systematic OKMC simulations were performed at a wide range of dose rate from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-3}$ dpa/s and temperature from 300 to 500$^\circ C$. Simulation results show that both a higher dose rate and a lower temperature can lead to a higher density and a smaller average size of voids. High dose rate greatly promotes the interaction frequency between small defects and inhibit the absorption of vacancies by one vacancy cluster, thus enhancing the nucleation of vacancy clusters. This dose rate effect explains the major difference of microstructure between fission neutron and heavy ion irradiation. High temperature enhances the migration of small defects and the absorption of vacancies by vacancy clusters, and thus enlarge the vacancy clusters. The impact of irradiation particle types that has influence on the primary knock-on atom spectrum and cascade morphology is less important to void evolution compared with dose rate and irradiation temperature. This work provides fundamental insights into the difference in void evolution between fission neutron and heavy ion irradiations that are important to the application of ion irradiations in study irradiation effects of nuclear materials.</description>

Abstract: The mechanical responses of single crystalline Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) metals, such as molybdenum (Mo), outperform other metals at high temperatures, so much so that they are considered as excellent candidates for applications under extreme conditions, such as the divertor of fusion reactors. The excellent thermomechanical stability of molybdenum at high temperatures (400-1000$^{\rm o}$C) has also been detected through nanoindentation, pointing towards connections to emergent local dislocation mechanisms related to defect nucleation. In this work, we carry out a computational study of the effects of high temperature on the mechanical deformation properties of single crystalline Mo under nanoindentation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of spherical nanoindentation are performed at two indenter tip diameters and crystalline sample orientations [100], [110], and [111], for the temperature range of 10-1000K. We investigate how the increase of temperature influences the nanoindentation process, modifying dislocation densities, mechanisms, atomic displacements and also, hardness, in agreement with reported experimental measurements. Our results suggest that the characteristic formation and high-temperature stability of [001] dislocation junctions in Mo during nanoindentation, in contrast to other BCC metals, may be the cause of the persistent thermomechanical stability of Mo.</description>

      <title>Modelling the mechanics of 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet using numerical simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High temperature REBCO superconducting tapes are very promising for high-field magnets. Under high magnetic fields there are high electro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large screening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design of these magnets are not straightforward. In addition, many present designs use insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the displacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a large number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an anisotropic bulk hollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in literature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following configuration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and we calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the MEMEP model. As a case study 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet is simulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet by including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike previous work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused. Effect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated and compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field strongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The latter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations. Additionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of different material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly reduces the mechanical stresses. The FE based model developed is efficient to calculate the mechanical behaviour of any general superconductor magnet and its devices.</description>

      <title>Practicality of training a quantum-classical machine in the NISQ era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in classical computing have significantly enhanced machine learning applications, yet inherent limitations persist in terms of energy, resource and speed. Quantum machine learning algorithms offer a promising avenue to overcome these limitations but poses its own hurdles. This experimental study explores the limits of training a real experimental quantum classical hybrid system using supervised training protocols, on an ion trap platform. Challenges associated with ion trap-coupled classical processors are addressed, highlighting the $robustness$ of the genetic algorithm as a classical optimizer in navigating the noisy channels of NISQ-devices and the complex optimization landscape inherent in binary classification problems with many local minima. We intricately discuss why gradient-based optimizers may not be suitable in the NISQ era through a thorough analysis. These findings contribute insights into the performance of quantum-classical hybrid systems, emphasizing the significance of efficient training strategies and hardware considerations for practical quantum machine learning applications. This work not only advances the understanding of hybrid quantum-classical systems but also underscores the potential impact on real-world challenges through the convergence of quantum and classical computing paradigms operating without the aid of classical simulators.</description>

      <title>A novel and fast electromagnetic and electrothermal software for quench analysis of high field magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-field superconducting REBCO magnets contain several coils with many turns. For these magnets, electro-thermal quench is an issue that magnet designers need to take into account. Thus, there is a need for a fast and accurate software to numerically model the overall performance of full-scale magnets. High temperature superconductors can be modeled using different techniques for electro-magnetic and thermal (finite element method) analysis. However, it takes a lot of time to model the electro-magnetic and electro-thermal behavior of superconductors simultaneously, especially for non-insulated or metal-insulated coils. In addition, most of the available methods ignore screening currents, which are an important feature of REBCO magnets. We have developed a novel software programmed in C++, which performs coupled electro-magnetic and electro-thermal analysis using variational methods based on Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) and Finite Difference, respectively. The developed software, which takes screening currents into account, is applied to axi-symmetric fullscale magnets of more than 32 T field strength under the SuperEMFL project for thermal quench reliability during standard operation. We show that the magnets incorporating non-insulated coils are more reliable against quench than the metal insulated coils. Also, realistic cooling conditions at boundaries is essential for such simulations. The model developed can be used for a quick and complete electro-magnetic and electro-thermal analysis of superconducting high field magnets.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07797v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Multiferroicity and Magnetoelectric coupling in Ca/Mn modified BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22018</link>

Abstract: Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are emerging field in modern technology and physics. BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~44 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</description>

      <title>One-step Fabrication of Sharp Platinum/Iridium Tips via Amplitude-Modulated Alternating-Current Electropolishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) alloy tip for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was fabricated by amplitude-modulated alternating-current (AC) electropolishing. The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the sinusoidal voltage in the frequency ($f_0$) of $900\ \mathrm{Hz} \leq f_0 \leq 1500\ \mathrm{Hz}$ with amplitude modulation by the sinusoidal wave in the modulation frequency ($f_s$) of $f_s=0.1f_0$ in $\mathrm{CaCl}_2$/$\mathrm{H_2O}$/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT) showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The STM imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus AFM analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.</description>

      <title>Large Bidirectional Refractive Index Change in Silicon-rich Nitride via Visible Light Trimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-sensitive integrated photonic devices are highly susceptible to minor manufacturing deviations, resulting in significant performance inconsistencies. This variability has limited the scalability and widespread adoption of these devices. Here, a major advancement is achieved through continuous-wave (CW) visible light (405 nm and 520 nm) trimming of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon-rich nitride (SRN) waveguides. The demonstrated method achieves precise, bidirectional refractive index tuning with a single laser source in CMOS-compatible SRN samples with refractive indices of 2.4 and 2.9 (measured at 1550 nm). By utilizing a cost-effective setup for real-time resonance tracking in micro-ring resonators, the resonant wavelength shifts as fine as 10 pm are attained. Additionally, a record red shift of 49.1 nm and a substantial blue shift of 10.6 nm are demonstrated, corresponding to refractive index changes of approximately 0.11 and -0.02. The blue and red shifts are both conclusively attributed to thermal annealing. These results highlight SRN's exceptional capability for permanent optical tuning, establishing a foundation for stable, precisely controlled performance in phase-sensitive integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Magic Cube Network with Super-high Capacity Enabled by Mechanical Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable metasurfaces have been extensively studied to enhance system capacity in response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information. Among them, the mechanically reconfigurable strategy offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization methods. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces. We utilized the deep diffractive neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single-focus/multi-focus, and 60-channel orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam/comb generation were numerically achieved and experimentally validated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a reflective mirror. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve metasurface capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.</description>
