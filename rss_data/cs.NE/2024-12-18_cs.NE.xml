      <title>An Adaptive Balance Search Based Complementary Heterogeneous Particle Swarm Optimization Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of modified cognitive-only particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms effectively mitigate premature convergence by constructing distinct vectors for different particles. However, the underutilization of these constructed vectors hampers convergence accuracy. In this paper, an adaptive balance search based complementary heterogeneous PSO architecture is proposed, which consists of a complementary heterogeneous PSO (CHxPSO) framework and an adaptive balance search (ABS) strategy. The CHxPSO framework mainly includes two update channels and two subswarms. Two channels exhibit nearly heterogeneous properties while sharing a common constructed vector. This ensures that one constructed vector is utilized across both heterogeneous update mechanisms. The two subswarms work within their respective channels during the evolutionary process, preventing interference between the two channels. The ABS strategy precisely controls the proportion of particles involved in the evolution in the two channels, and thereby guarantees the flexible utilization of the constructed vectors, based on the evolutionary process and the interactions with the problem's fitness landscape. Together, our architecture ensures the effective utilization of the constructed vectors by emphasizing exploration in the early evolutionary process while exploitation in the later, enhancing the performance of a series of modified cognitive-only PSOs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the generalization performance of our architecture.</description>

      <title>Empathic Coupling of Homeostatic States for Intrinsic Prosociality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When regarding the suffering of others, we often experience personal distress and feel compelled to help. Inspired by living systems, we investigate the emergence of prosocial behavior among autonomous agents that are motivated by homeostatic self-regulation. We perform multi-agent reinforcement learning, treating each agent as a vulnerable homeostat charged with maintaining its own well-being. We introduce an empathy-like mechanism to share homeostatic states between agents: an agent can either \emph{observe} their partner's internal state (cognitive empathy) or the agent's internal state can be \emph{directly coupled} to that of their partner's (affective empathy). In three simple multi-agent environments, we show that prosocial behavior arises only under homeostatic coupling - when the distress of a partner can affect one's own well-being. Our findings specify the type and role of empathy in artificial agents capable of prosocial behavior.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Optimization for Designing Variational Quantum Circuits with High Model Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have garnered significant attention, leading to substantial efforts toward the development of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a variety of complex challenges. The design of high-performance QML models, however, requires expert-level knowledge, posing a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of QML. Key challenges include the design of data encoding mechanisms and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which critically impact the generalization capabilities of QML models. We propose a novel method that encodes quantum circuit architecture information to enable the evolution of quantum circuit designs. In this approach, the fitness function is based on the effective dimension, allowing for the optimization of quantum circuits towards higher model capacity. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of discovering variational quantum circuit architectures that offer improved learning capabilities, thereby enhancing the overall performance of QML models for complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hash Chemistry, a minimalistic artificial chemistry model of open-ended evolution, has recently been extended to non-spatial and cellular versions. The non-spatial version successfully demonstrated continuous adaptation and unbounded growth of complexity of self-replicating entities, but it did not simulate multiscale ecological interactions among the entities. On the contrary, the cellular version explicitly represented multiscale spatial ecological interactions among evolving patterns, yet it failed to show meaningful adaptive evolution or complexity growth. It remains an open question whether it is possible to create a similar minimalistic evolutionary system that can exhibit all of those desired properties at once within a computationally efficient framework. Here we propose an improved version called Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry (SCHC). In SCHC, individual identities of evolving patterns are explicitly represented and processed as the connected components of the nearest neighbor graph of active cells. The neighborhood connections are established by connecting active cells with other active cells in their Moore neighborhoods in a 2D cellular grid. Evolutionary dynamics in SCHC are simulated via pairwise competitions of two randomly selected patterns, following the approach used in the non-spatial Hash Chemistry. SCHC's computational cost was significantly less than the original and non-spatial versions. Numerical simulations showed that these model modifications achieved spontaneous movement, self-replication and unbounded growth of complexity of spatial evolving patterns, which were clearly visible in space in a highly intuitive manner. Detailed analysis of simulation results showed that there were spatial ecological interactions among self-replicating patterns and their diversity was also substantially promoted in SCHC, neither of which was present in the non-spatial version.</description>

      <title>Populating cellular metamaterials on the extrema of attainable elasticity through neuroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.</description>

      <title>Runtime Analysis for Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms in Unbounded Integer Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized search heuristics have been applied successfully to a plethora of problems. This success is complemented by a large body of theoretical results. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these results regard problems with binary or continuous decision variables -- the theoretical analysis of randomized search heuristics for unbounded integer domains is almost nonexistent. To resolve this shortcoming, we start the runtime analysis of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which are among the most successful randomized search heuristics, for unbounded integer search spaces. We analyze single- and full-dimensional mutation operators with three different mutation strengths, namely changes by plus/minus one (unit strength), random changes following a law with exponential tails, and random changes following a power-law. The performance guarantees we prove on a recently proposed natural benchmark problem suggest that unit mutation strengths can be slow when the initial solutions are far from the Pareto front. When setting the expected change right (depending on the benchmark parameter and the distance of the initial solutions), the mutation strength with exponential tails yields the best runtime guarantees in our results -- however, with a wrong choice of this expectation, the performance guarantees quickly become highly uninteresting. With power-law mutation, which is an essentially parameter-less mutation operator, we obtain good results uniformly over all problem parameters and starting points. We complement our mathematical findings with experimental results that suggest that our bounds are not always tight. Most prominently, our experiments indicate that power-law mutation outperforms the one with exponential tails even when the latter uses a near-optimal parametrization. Hence, we suggest to favor power-law mutation for unknown problems in integer spaces.</description>

      <title>Speeding Up the NSGA-II With a Simple Tie-Breaking Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm~II (NSGA-II) is the most popular multi-objective optimization heuristic. Recent mathematical runtime analyses have detected two shortcomings in discrete search spaces, namely, that the NSGA-II has difficulties with more than two objectives and that it is very sensitive to the choice of the population size. To overcome these difficulties, we analyze a simple tie-breaking rule in the selection of the next population. Similar rules have been proposed before, but have found only little acceptance. We prove the effectiveness of our tie-breaking rule via mathematical runtime analyses on the classic OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks. We prove that this modified NSGA-II can optimize the three benchmarks efficiently also for many objectives, in contrast to the exponential lower runtime bound previously shown for OneMinMax with three or more objectives. For the bi-objective problems, we show runtime guarantees that do not increase when moderately increasing the population size over the minimum admissible size. For example, for the OneJumpZeroJump problem with representation length $n$ and gap parameter $k$, we show a runtime guarantee of $O(\max\{n^{k+1},Nn\})$ function evaluations when the population size is at least four times the size of the Pareto front. For population sizes larger than the minimal choice $N = \Theta(n)$, this result improves considerably over the $\Theta(Nn^k)$ runtime of the classic NSGA-II.</description>

      <title>Decictor: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial in ADS development, with the current primary focus being on safety. However, the evaluation of non-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS's ability to make optimal decisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is also vital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is little work dedicated to assessing the robustness of ADSs' path-planning decisions (PPDs), i.e., whether an ADS can maintain the optimal PPD after an insignificant change in the environment. The key challenges include the lack of clear oracles for assessing PPD optimality and the difficulty in searching for scenarios that lead to non-optimal PPDs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on evaluating the robustness of ADSs' PPDs and propose the first method, Decictor, for generating non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not plan optimal paths for AVs. Decictor comprises three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, Consistency Check, and Feedback. To overcome the oracle challenge, Non-invasive Mutation is devised to implement conservative modifications, ensuring the preservation of the original optimal path in the mutated scenarios. Subsequently, the Consistency Check is applied to determine the presence of non-optimal PPDs by comparing the driving paths in the original and mutated scenarios. To deal with the challenge of large environment space, we design Feedback metrics that integrate spatial and temporal dimensions of the AV's movement. These metrics are crucial for effectively steering the generation of NoDSs. We evaluate Decictor on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Decictor in detecting non-optimal PPDs of ADSs.</description>

      <title>Plastic Arbor: a modern simulation framework for synaptic plasticity $\unicode{x2013}$ from single synapses to networks of morphological neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems.
  In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to the Plastic Arbor framework, supporting simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the new framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. Using the new framework, we have already been able to investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, showing a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information.
  By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.</description>
