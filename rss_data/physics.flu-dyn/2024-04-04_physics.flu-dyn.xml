      <title>Modelling large mass removal in adsorption columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model is developed to describe column adsorption when the contaminant constitutes a significant amount of the fluid. This requires modelling the variation of pressure and velocity, in addition to the usual advection-diffusion-adsorption and kinetic equations describing concentration and adsorption rates. The model builds on previous work based on a linear kinetic equation, to include both physical and chemical adsorption. A semi-analytical solution is developed and validated against a numerical solution. The model is tested against experimental data for the adsorption of large quantities of CO$_2$ from a helium mixture, with a CO$_2$ volume fraction ranging from 14% to 69%, and a N$_2$ mixture with 16% to 33% CO$_2$ volume fraction. Our results show a significant improvement with respect to models for the removal of trace amounts of contaminant.</description>

      <title>Preventing mass loss in the standard level set method: New insights from variational analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, the computational multiphase flow community has grappled with mass loss in the level set method. Numerous solutions have been proposed, from fixing the reinitialization step to combining the level set method with other conservative schemes. However, our work reveals a more fundamental culprit: the smooth Heaviside and delta functions inherent to the standard formulation. Even if reinitialization is done exactly, i.e., the zero contour interface remains stationary, the use of smooth functions lead to violation of mass conservation. We propose a novel approach using variational analysis to incorporate a mass conservation constraint. This introduces a Lagrange multiplier that enforces overall mass balance. Notably, as the delta function sharpens, i.e., approaches the Dirac delta limit, the Lagrange multiplier approaches zero. However, the exact Lagrange multiplier method disrupts the signed distance property of the level set function. This motivates us to develop an approximate version of the Lagrange multiplier that preserves both overall mass and signed distance property of the level set function. Our framework even recovers existing mass-conserving level set methods, revealing some inconsistencies in prior analyses. We extend this approach to three-phase flows for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. We present variational equations in both immersed and non-immersed forms, demonstrating the convergence of the former formulation to the latter when the body delta function sharpens. Rigorous test problems confirm that the FSI dynamics produced by our simple, easy-to-implement immersed formulation with the approximate Lagrange multiplier method are accurate and match state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Droplet Breakup Model for Eulerian-Lagrangian Simulation of Liquid-fueled Detonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic model to reflect the physical image of the droplet breakup process in two-phase detonation flows. This breakup model is implemented in a two-phase detonation solver developed based on an open-source computational fluid dynamic platform, OpenFOAM, and compared with three prevalent models (TAB, PilchErdman, and ReitzKH-RT model) under different droplet diameters in one- and two-dimensional detonation problems. The simulating results show that the present breakup model well predicts experimentally determined detonation parameters such as detonation velocities and post-wave temperature. In addition, the present model has the advantage of being free of the KH breakup time parameter, which is needed by the ReitzKH-RT model to fit the experimental data. The one-dimensional detonation simulations indicate that different breakup models have a slight impact on the detonation wave velocity because the droplet breakup process does not significantly affect the total heat release as long as it is sufficiently fast to sustain the detonation. However, the two-dimensional detonation simulations show that both the breakup model and the droplet initial diameter significantly affect the detonation cell size due to the different droplet distributions predicted by different models. The breakup length, which is the distance from the shock wave to the location at which sufficiently small child droplets appear, affects the chemical reaction zone thickness, which in turn affects the detonation cell size. A longer breakup length will result in a larger detonation cell size.</description>

      <title>A swimming bacterium in a two-fluid model of a polymer solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the motion of a flagellated bacterium in a two-fluid medium using slender body theory. The two-fluid model is useful for describing a body moving through a complex fluid with a microstructure whose length scale is comparable to the characteristic scale of the body. This is true for bacterial motion in biological fluids (entangled polymer solutions), where the entanglement results in a porous microstructure with typical pore diameters comparable to or larger than the flagellar bundle diameter but smaller than the diameter of the bacterial head. Thus the polymer and solvent satisfy different boundary conditions on the flagellar bundle and move with different velocities close to it. This gives rise to a screening length $L_B$ within which the fluids exchange momentum and the relative velocity between the two fluids decays. In this work, both the solvent and polymer of the two-fluid medium are modeled as Newtonian fluids with different viscosities $\mu_s$ and $\mu_p$ (viscosity ratio $\lambda = \mu_p/\mu_s$), thereby capturing the effects solely introduced by the microstructure of the complex fluid. From our calculations, we observe an increased drag anisotropy for a rigid, slender flagellar bundle moving through this two-fluid medium, resulting in an enhanced swimming velocity of the organism. The results are sensitive to the interaction between the bundle and the polymer and we discuss two physical scenarios corresponding to two types of interaction. Our model provides an explanation for the experimentally observed enhancement of swimming velocity of bacteria in entangled polymer solutions and motivates further experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Neural Networks for Free Shear Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformative impact of machine learning, particularly Deep Learning (DL), on scientific and engineering domains is evident. In the context of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a significant innovation, enabling data-driven fluid simulations while incorporating physics-based laws described by partial differential equations (PDEs). While PINNs have demonstrated efficacy in various fluid flow scenarios, a noticeable gap exists in their application to simulate jet flows - an essential category in engineering. Jets, crucial for downburst outflow, ventilation, and heat transfer, lack comprehensive exploration through PINNs in existing literature. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the application of PINNs to simulate steady jet flows, specifically 2D planar turbulent jet flow scenarios. The novelty lies not only in adapting PINNs for simulating jet flows but also in overcoming challenges such as poor convergence during training, attributed to imbalances in loss terms. We propose a novel PINN architecture for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation of steady turbulent jet flows, without the need for turbulence models and simulation data. Additionally, an extended dynamic weighting strategy is introduced to enhance the balance of loss term contributions in the PINN, resulting in improved convergence and more accurate predictions.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Based Convolutional Neural Network for the Simulation and Prediction of Two-Phase Darcy Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant prominence as a powerful tool in the field of scientific computing and simulations. Their ability to seamlessly integrate physical principles into deep learning architectures has revolutionized the approaches to solving complex problems in physics and engineering. However, a persistent challenge faced by mainstream PINNs lies in their handling of discontinuous input data, leading to inaccuracies in predictions. This study addresses these challenges by incorporating the discretized forms of the governing equations into the PINN framework. We propose to combine the power of neural networks with the dynamics imposed by the discretized differential equations. By discretizing the governing equations, the PINN learns to account for the discontinuities and accurately capture the underlying relationships between inputs and outputs, improving the accuracy compared to traditional interpolation techniques. Moreover, by leveraging the power of neural networks, the computational cost associated with numerical simulations is substantially reduced. We evaluate our model on a large-scale dataset for the prediction of pressure and saturation fields demonstrating high accuracies compared to non-physically aware models.</description>

      <title>Instability in strongly stratified plane Couette flow, with application to supercritical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stability of plane Couette flow in the presence of strong density and viscosity stratifications. It demonstrates the existence of a generalised inflection point that satisfies the generalised Fjortoft's criterion of instability when a minimum of kinematic viscosity is present in the base flow. The characteristic scales associated with this minimum are identified as the primary controlling parameters of the associated instability, regardless of the type of stratification. To support this finding, analytical stability models are derived in the long wave approximation using piecewise linear base flows. Numerical stability calculations are carried out to validate these models and to provide further information on the production of disturbance vorticity. All instabilities are interpreted as arising from the interaction between two vorticity waves. Depending on the type of stratification, these two waves are produced by different physical mechanisms. When both strong density and viscosity stratifications are present, we show that they result from the concurrent action of shear and inertial baroclinic effects. The stability models developed for simple fluid models ultimately shed light on a recently observed unstable mode in supercritical fluids (Ren et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 871, 2019, pp. 831-864), providing a quantitative prediction of the stability diagram and identifying the dominant mechanisms at play. Furthermore, our study suggests that the minimum of kinematic viscosity reached at the Widom line in these fluids is the leading cause of their instability. The existence of similar instabilities in different fluids and flows (e.g., miscible fluids) is finally discussed.</description>

      <title>Droplet morphology-based wettability tuning and design of fog harvesting mesh to minimize mesh-clogging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fog harvesting relies on intercepting atmospheric or industrial fog by placing a porous obstacle, e.g., a mesh and collecting the deposited water. In the face of global water scarcity, such fog harvesting has emerged as a viable alternative source of potable water. Typical fog harvesting meshes suffer from poor collection efficiency due to aerodynamic bypassing of the oncoming fog stream and poor collection of the deposited water from the mesh. One pestering challenge in this context is the frequent clogging up of mesh pores by the deposited fog water, which not only yields low drainage efficiency but also generates high aerodynamic resistance to the oncoming fog stream, thereby negatively impacting the fog collection efficiency. Minimizing the clogging is possible by rendering the mesh fiber superhydrophobic, but that entails other detrimental effects like premature dripping and flow-induced re-entrainment of water droplets into the fog stream from the mesh fiber. Herein, we improvise on the traditional interweaved metal mesh designs by defining critical parameters, viz., mesh pitch, shade coefficient, and fiber wettability, and deduce their optimal values from numerically and experimentally observed morphology of collected fog-water droplets under various operating scenarios. We extend our investigations over a varying range of mesh-wettability, including superhydrophilic and hydrophobic fibers, and go on to find optimal shade coefficients which would theoretically render clog-proof fog harvesting meshes. The aerodynamic, deposition, and overall collection efficiencies are characterized. Hydrophobic meshes with square pores, having fiber diameters smaller than the capillary length scale of water, and an optimal shade coefficient, are found to be the most effective design of such clog-proof meshes.</description>
