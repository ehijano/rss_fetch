      <title>Intrinsic Universality in Seeded Active Tile Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tile Automata (TA) model describes self-assembly systems in which monomers can build structures and transition with an adjacent monomer to change their states. This paper shows that seeded TA is a non-committal intrinsically universal model of self-assembly. We present a single universal Tile Automata system containing approximately 4600 states that can simulate (a) the output assemblies created by any other Tile Automata system G, (b) the dynamics involved in building G's assemblies, and (c) G's internal state transitions. It does so in a non-committal way: it preserves the full non-deterministic dynamics of a tile's potential attachment or transition by selecting its state in a single step, considering all possible outcomes until the moment of selection.
  The system uses supertiles, each encoding the complete system being simulated. The universal system builds supertiles from its seed, each representing a single tile in G, transferring the information to simulate G to each new tile. Supertiles may also asynchronously transition states according to the rules of G. This result directly transfers to a restricted version of asynchronous Cellular Automata: pairwise Cellular Automata.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom density matrices</title>

Abstract: Pseudorandom states (PRSs) are state ensembles that cannot be distinguished from Haar random states by any efficient quantum algorithm. However, the definition of PRSs has been limited to pure states and lacks robustness against noise. In this work, we introduce pseudorandom density matrices (PRDMs), ensembles of $n$-qubit states that are computationally indistinguishable from the generalized Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble, which is constructed from $(n+m)$-qubit Haar random states with $m$ qubits traced out. For a mixedness parameter $m=0$, PRDMs are equivalent to PRSs, whereas for $m=\omega(\log n)$, PRDMs are computationally indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. In contrast to PRSs, PRDMs with $m=\omega(\log n)$ are robust to unital noise channels and a recently introduced $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ attack. Further, we construct pseudomagic and pseudocoherent state ensembles, which possess near-maximal magic and coherence, but are computationally indistinguishable from states with zero magic and coherence. PRDMs can exhibit a pseudoresource gap of $\Theta(n)$ vs $0$, surpassing previously found gaps. We introduce noise-robust EFI pairs, which are state ensembles that are computationally indistinguishable yet statistically far, even when subject to noise. We show that testing entanglement, magic and coherence is not efficient. Further, we prove that black-box resource distillation requires a superpolynomial number of copies. We also establish lower bounds on the purity needed for efficient testing and black-box distillation. Finally, we introduce memoryless PRSs, a noise-robust notion of PRS which are indistinguishable to Haar random states for efficient algorithms without quantum memory. Our work provides a comprehensive framework of pseudorandomness for mixed states, which yields powerful quantum cryptographic primitives and fundamental bounds on quantum resource theories.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds Imply Circuit Lower Bounds: from random 2-SAT to Planted Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that sharp thresholds for Boolean functions directly imply average-case circuit lower bounds. More formally we show that any Boolean function exhibiting a sharp enough threshold at \emph{arbitrary} critical density cannot be computed by Boolean circuits of bounded depth and polynomial size. We also prove a partial converse: if a monotone graph invariant Boolean function does not have a sharp threshold then it can be computed on average by a Boolean circuit of bounded depth and polynomial size.
  Our general result also implies new average-case bounded depth circuit lower bounds in a variety of settings.
  (a) ($k$-cliques) For $k=\Theta(n)$, we prove that any circuit of depth $d$ deciding the presence of a size $k$ clique in a random graph requires exponential-in-$n^{\Theta(1/d)}$ size.
  (b)(random 2-SAT) We prove that any circuit of depth $d$ deciding the satisfiability of a random 2-SAT formula requires exponential-in-$n^{\Theta(1/d)}$ size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bounded depth circuit lower bound for random $k$-SAT for any value of $k \geq 2.$ Our results also provide the first rigorous lower bound in agreement with a conjectured, but debated, "computational hardness" of random $k$-SAT around its satisfiability threshold.
  (c)(Statistical estimation -- planted $k$-clique) Over the recent years, multiple statistical estimation problems have also been proven to exhibit a "statistical" sharp threshold, called the All-or-Nothing (AoN) phenomenon. We show that AoN also implies circuit lower bounds for statistical problems. As a simple corollary of that, we prove that any circuit of depth $d$ that solves to information-theoretic optimality a "dense" variant of the celebrated planted $k$-clique problem requires exponential-in-$n^{\Theta(1/d)}$ size.</description>

      <title>Border Ranks of Monomials</title>

Abstract: Young flattenings, introduced by Landsberg and Ottaviani, give determinantal equations for secant varieties and their non-vanishing provides lower bounds for border ranks of tensors and in particular polynomials. We study monomial-optimal shapes for Young flattenings, which exhibit the limits of the Young flattening method. In particular, they provide the best possible lower bound for large classes of monomials including all monomials up to degree 6, monomials in 3 variables, and any power of the product of variables. On the other hand, for degree 7 and higher there are monomials for which no Young flattening can give a lower bound that matches the conjecturally tight upper bound of Landsberg and Teitler.</description>

      <title>There Are No Post-Quantum Weakly Pseudo-Free Families in Any Nontrivial Variety of Expanded Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a finite set of finitary operation symbols and let $\mathfrak V$ be a nontrivial variety of $\Omega$-algebras. Assume that for some set $\Gamma\subseteq\Omega$ of group operation symbols, all $\Omega$-algebras in $\mathfrak V$ are groups under the operations associated with the symbols in $\Gamma$. In other words, $\mathfrak V$ is assumed to be a nontrivial variety of expanded groups. In particular, $\mathfrak V$ can be a nontrivial variety of groups or rings. Our main result is that there are no post-quantum weakly pseudo-free families in $\mathfrak V$, even in the worst-case setting and/or the black-box model. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to families $(H_d\mathbin|d\in D)$ of computational and black-box $\Omega$-algebras (where $D\subseteq\{0,1\}^*$) such that for every $d\in D$, each element of $H_d$ is represented by a unique bit string of length polynomial in the length of $d$. In our main result, we use straight-line programs to represent nontrivial relations between elements of $\Omega$-algebras. Note that under certain conditions, this result depends on the classification of finite simple groups. Also, we define and study some types of weak pseudo-freeness for families of computational and black-box $\Omega$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Fair Interventions in Weighted Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the power and limitations of fair interventions in weighted congestion games. Specifically, we focus on interventions that aim at improving the equilibrium quality (price of anarchy) and are fair in a suitably defined sense. Within this setting, we provide three key contributions. First, we show that no fair intervention can reduce the price of anarchy below a given factor depending solely on the class of latencies considered. Interestingly, this lower bound is unconditional, i.e., it applies regardless of how much computation interventions are allowed to use. Second, we design a taxation mechanism that is fair and achieves a price of anarchy matching this unconditional lower bound, all the while being polynomial-time computable. Third, we show that no intervention (fair or not) can achieve a better approximation if polynomial computability is required. We do so by proving that the minimum social cost is NP-hard to minimize below a factor identical to the one previously introduced. In doing so, our work shows that the algorithm proposed by Makarychev and Sviridenko (Journal of the ACM, 2018) to tackle optimization problems with a "diseconomy of scale" is optimal, and provide a novel way to derandomize its solution via equilibrium computation.</description>
