      <title>Linear-in-temperature resistivity and Planckian dissipation arise in a stochastic quantization model of Cooper pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suppose that a Cooper pair (CP) will experience a damping force exerted by the condensed matter. A Langevin equation of a CP in two dimensional condensed matter is established. Following a method similar to Nelson's stochastic mechanics, generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation of a CP in condensed matter is derived. If the CPs move with a constant velocity, then the corresponding direct current (DC) electrical conductivity can be calculated. Therefore, a Drude like formula of resistivity of CPs is derived. We suppose that the damping coefficient of CPs in two dimensional cuprate superconductors is a linear function of temperature. Then the resistivity and scattering rate of CPs turn out to be also linear-in-temperature. The origin of linear-in-temperature resistivity and Planckian dissipation in cuprate superconductors may be the linear temperature dependence of the damping coefficient of CPs.</description>

      <title>Layer buckling and absence of superconductivity in LaNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of unconventional superconductivity in thin films of LaNiO2 (critical temperature, Tc~10 K) and in bulk single crystals of La3Ni2O7 (327) under pressure (Tc~80 K), has brought to light a long sought-after class of superconducting nickelates. Through structural measurements in the 327-system, it was shown that the absence of superconductivity is related to bending of the O-Ni-O bonds. Similarly, the bond bending may be linked to the absence of superconductivity in bulk LaNiO2. Neutron diffraction was used on bulk non-superconducting La(1-x)Sr(x)NiO(2) samples to show that the layers are naturally buckled, creating a Ni-O-Ni bond angle of 177 at 2 K and ambient pressure. The buckling angle increases to 170 on warming to room temperature. Furthermore, a broad paramagnetic continuum is observed that decreases in intensity on cooling from room temperature signaling a possible transition to a coherent state. However, no antiferromagnetic (AFM) peaks are detected, although enhancement of ferromagnetic (FM) correlations cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of a superconductor interfaced with an altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently introduced magnetic materials called altermagnets (AM) feature zero net magnetization but a momentum dependent magnetic exchange field, which can have intriguing implications when combined with superconductivity. In our work, we use the quasiclassical framework to study the effects of such a material on a conventional superconductor (S) in an AM/S bilayer. We discuss the superconducting phase diagram and heat capacity of AM/S while making a comparison with a ferromagnet-superconductor bilayer. Furthermore, we examine the density of states and analyze the system's response to an external magnetic field. We illustrate the anisotropy of spin-susceptibility and magnetization of AM/S by considering an external field in the in-plane and out-of-plane direction, thereby facilitating the scope of experimental detection and characterization of an AM in an AM/S hybrid system.</description>

      <title>Perturbative description of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the Hubbard model via unitary transformation and classical spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unitary transformation is applied to the Hubbard model, which maps the Hubbard interaction to a single particle term. The resulting Hamiltonian consists of unconstrained fermions, which is then mapped to a Hamiltonian of spinless fermions coupled to pseudospins. The fermions are integrated out using second order perturbation theory in $1/U$, resulting in an effective spin Hamiltonian. An order parameter is identified, stabilizing d-wave superconductivity. The groundstate energy of classical spin configurations is minimized at a finite value of this order parameter after a critical chemical potential, resulting in d-wave superconductivity at non-zero doping. This suggests, that the onset of high-$T_c$ superconductivity is governed by the groundstate of a classical spin system.</description>

      <title>Why shot noise does not generally detect pairing in mesoscopic superconducting tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shot noise in tunneling experiments reflects the Poissonian nature of the tunneling process. The shot noise power is proportional to both the magnitude of the current and the effective charge of the carrier. Shot noise spectroscopy thus enables, in principle, to determine the effective charge q of the charge carriers that tunnel. This can be used to detect electron pairing in superconductors: in the normal state, the noise corresponds to single electron tunneling (q = 1e), while in the paired state, the noise corresponds to q = 2e. Here, we use a newly developed amplifier to reveal that in typical mesoscopic superconducting junctions, the shot noise does not reflect the signatures of pairing and instead stays at a level corresponding to q = 1e. We show that transparency can control the shot noise and this q = 1e is due to the large number of tunneling channels with each having very low transparency. Our results indicate that in typical mesoscopic superconducting junctions one should expect q = 1e noise, and lead to design guidelines for junctions that allow the detection of electron pairing.</description>

      <title>Towards reliable synthesis of superconducting infinite layer nickelate thin films by topochemical reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite layer nickelates provide a new route beyond copper oxides to address outstanding questions in the field of unconventional superconductivity. However, their synthesis poses considerable challenges, largely hindering experimental research on this new class of oxide superconductors. That synthesis is achieved in a two-step process that yields the most thermodynamically stable perovskite phase first, then the infinite-layer phase by topotactic reduction, the quality of the starting phase playing a crucial role. Here, we report on reliable synthesis of superconducting infinite-layer nickelate films after successive topochemical reductions of a parent perovskite phase with nearly optimal stoichiometry. Careful analysis of the transport properties of the incompletely reduced films reveals an improvement of the strange metal behaviour of their normal state resistivity over subsequent topochemical reductions, offering insight into the reduction process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a study of the interplay between the supercurrent and spin-polarization in a two-dimensional superconducting system in the presence of a d-wave symmetric antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (altermagnetism). It is demonstrated that the supercurrent exhibits a transverse contribution in the presence of both constant and momentum-dependent exchange interactions. We also discuss the analog of the Edelstein effect for such magnetic material, showing that the induced spin polarization is quadratic in the supercurrent and d-wave symmetric.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Two-Dimensional Systems with Unconventional Rashba Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional system with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, it is well-known that superconductivity can have mixed spin-singlet and -triplet parity, and the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-triplet pairing is parallel to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here, we propose a model to describe a two-dimensional system with unconventional Rashba bands and study its superconductivity. We show that the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-triplet pairing can be either parallel or perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling depending on the different pairing interaction. We also propose a junction to generate tunneling spin current depending on the direction of $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector. It provides a detecable evidence to distinguish these two different but very similar pairing channels. Furthermore, we find this model can give arise to a subleading spin-singlet chiral $p$-wave topological superconducting state. More significantly, we find that such unconventional Rashba bands and unconventional superconudcting pairings can be realized on surface of some superconducting topological materials, such as trigonal layered PtBi$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Higgs Condensates are Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases: I. Discrete Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Where in the landscape of many-body phases of matter do we place the Higgs condensate of a gauge theory? On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has no local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically connected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as superconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal description of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, utilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus on 2+1D $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected by a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends on the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs phases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has SPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm analytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust upon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined phases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a boundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations. More generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the emergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation between Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase can also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs condensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT phases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge group analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The sequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries, interpreting superconductivity as an SPT property.</description>

      <title>Triplet-odd pairing in finite nuclear systems: Even-even singly closed nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: The appearance of the pairing condensate is an essential feature of many-fermion systems. There are two possible types of pairing: spin-singlet and spin-triplet. However, an open question remains as to whether the spin-triplet pairing condensate emerges in finite nuclei. Purpose: The aim of this work is to examine the coexistence of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet like-particle pairing condensates in nuclei. We also discuss the dependence on the type of pairing functional. Method: The Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations with a Skyrme $+$ local-pair energy-density functional (EDF) are performed to investigate the pairing condensate in the spherical ground states of Ca and Sn isotopes. Results: The spin-singlet pair EDF induces not only the spin-singlet but also the spin-triplet pairing condensates due to a strong spin-orbit splitting. By discarding the spin-orbit EDF, only the spin-singlet pairing condensate appears. The spin-triplet pair EDF, however, induces the spin-orbit splitting and accordingly the spin-singlet pairing condensate. Conclusions: The spin-orbit splitting plays an essential role in the coexistence of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing condensates in nuclei.</description>
