      <title>Impact of Tobacco Advertising Restrictions in Switzerland: A Quasi-Experimental Study on the Effect of Billboard Bans on Smoking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study assesses the impact of tobacco billboard bans on smoking in Switzerland, exploiting their staggered adoption across regions, i.e., the cantons. Based on retrospective smoking histories from the Swiss Health Survey, a panel of individuals' annual smoking status is reconstructed, containing more than one million observations from 1993 to 2017. Estimation relies on staggered difference-in-differences as well as a complementary latent factor model, which relaxes the common trends assumption. The findings indicate that tobacco billboard bans lead to a reduction in smoking rates. Reductions of up to 0.9 percentage points correspond to an approximate 3% decline in the smoking rate. The effect is driven by women and individuals aged 25-44 and 65+. Overall, this evidence suggests that even partial tobacco advertising bans, such as billboard bans, can effectively reduce smoking rates and serve as a valuable policy tool within comprehensive tobacco prevention strategies.</description>

      <title>Destination Drone: A Comprehensive Analysis of Japanese Consumer Choice Behavior and Intentions for Drone Delivery Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for drone delivery services to transform logistics systems and consumer behavior has gained increasing attention. However, comprehensive empirical evidence on consumer delivery choice behavior within the context of transportation and urban air logistics remains limited, particularly in Japan. This study addresses this gap by examining Japanese consumers' preferences and behavioral intentions toward drone delivery services. Using a stated preference (SP) survey and discrete choice modeling approaches, including multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (MMNL) models, the analysis evaluates how delivery cost, delivery time, drop-off location, product type, and social influence affect delivery mode choices across different demographic groups. The results indicate that although consumers express interest in drone delivery, perceived cost and concerns related to reliability continue to constrain adoption. Younger and male consumers exhibit higher preferences for drone delivery, while product type, particularly daily consumer goods and medical or healthcare items, plays a significant role in shaping preferences. Post-estimation willingness-to-pay and elasticity analyses further highlight consumers' sensitivity to delivery pricing and speed attributes. Overall, the findings provide actionable insights for logistics service providers and policymakers regarding pricing strategies, service targeting, and deployment approaches for integrating drone delivery into Japan's evolving logistics system.</description>

      <title>Identifying Latent Intentions via Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Repeated Linear Public Good Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior in repeated public goods games continues to challenge standard theory: heterogeneous social preferences can explain first-round contributions, but not the substantial volatility observed across repeated interactions. Using 50,390 decisions from 2,938 participants, we introduce two methodological advances to address this gap. First, we cluster behavioral trajectories by their temporal shape using Dynamic Time Warping, yielding distinct and theoretically interpretable behavioral types. Second, we apply a hierarchical inverse Q-learning framework that models decisions as discrete switches between latent cooperative and defective intentions. This approach reveals a large (21.4%) and previously unmodeled behavioral type -- Switchers -- who frequently reverse intentions rather than commit to stable strategies. At the same time, the framework recovers canonical strategic behaviors such as persistent cooperation and free-riding. Substantively, recognizing intentional volatility helps sustain cooperation: brief defections by Switchers often reverse, so strategic patience can prevent unnecessary breakdowns.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-First Satellite Integration in Robust Portfolio Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of thematic satellite allocations into core-satellite portfolio architectures is commonly approached using factor exposures, discretionary convictions, or backtested performance, with feasibility assessed primarily through liquidity screens or market-impact considerations. While such approaches may be appropriate at institutional scale, they are ill-suited to small portfolios and robustness-oriented allocation frameworks, where dominant constraints arise not from return predictability or trading capacity, but from fixed costs, irreversibility risk, and governance complexity. This paper develops a feasibility-first, non-predictive framework for satellite integration that is explicitly scale-aware. We formalize four nested feasibility layers (physical, economic, structural, and epistemic) that jointly determine whether a satellite allocation is admissible. Physical feasibility ensures implementability under concave market-impact laws; economic feasibility suppresses noise-dominated reallocations via cost-dominance threshold constraints; structural feasibility bounds satellite size through an explicit optionality budget defined by tolerable loss under thesis failure; and epistemic feasibility limits satellite breadth and dispersion through an entropy-based complexity budget. Within this hierarchy, structural optionality is identified as the primary design principle for thematic satellites, with the remaining layers acting as robustness lenses rather than optimization criteria. The framework yields closed-form feasibility bounds on satellite size, turnover, and breadth without reliance on return forecasts, factor premia, or backtested performance, providing a disciplined basis for integrating thematic satellites into small, robustness-oriented portfolios.</description>

      <title>Remote Work and Women's Labor Supply: The New Gender Division at Home</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how increases in remote work opportunities for men affect their spouses' labor supply. Exploiting variation in the change in work-from-home (WFH) exposure across occupations before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that increases in husbands' WFH exposure lead to sizable improvements in wives' labor-market outcomes: annual employment rises by roughly 2.5 percentage points (from a 69% pre-treatment mean), earnings increase by about 5%, weekly hours worked rise by roughly half an hour, weeks worked increase by about 1.3%, and the likelihood of part-time work declines by approximately 9%. Evidence from time-use diaries and childcare questionnaires suggests these effects are driven by intra-household reallocation of child-caring time: women are less likely to engage in primary childcare activities, while men working at home partially compensate by covering more for their spouse. These results highlight the role of collective household decision-making in shaping the labor market consequences of remote work.</description>

      <title>Classifying Tokenised Money: Dimensions and Design Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tokenised money encompasses a broad range of digital monetary instruments issued on distributed ledger technology, including Central Bank Digital Currencys (CBDCs), deposit tokens, stablecoins, and decentralised protocol-based designs. Despite their shared monetary function, these instruments differ markedly in issuer structure, collateralisation, stability mechanisms, governance, and technological embedding, creating conceptual ambiguity. This paper proposes a concise taxonomy spanning twelve key design dimensions, offering a systematic framework for comparing heterogeneous forms of tokenised money. The taxonomy clarifies how different design choices shape monetary properties, risks, and policy implications, supporting clearer analysis and dialogue across academia, industry, and regulation.</description>
