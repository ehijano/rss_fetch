      <title>Secondary Species formed from ionic liquid electrospray ion plume impacts with propellant thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operational lifetime of ionic liquid electrospray propulsion systems is limited by plume-extractor electrode interactions. Over time, propellant accumulation, surface erosion, and electrical shorts degrade the extractor and therefore restrict the total impulse throughput. Characterizing the secondary species generated by plume impacts with deposited ionic liquid is therefore essential to understanding and mitigating these degradation pathways. A surface analysis technique known as Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), in the form of a custom electrospray laboratory diagnostic and an analytical-grade system, yields a comprehensive analysis of secondary ions formed from energetic ion beam impacts with ionic liquid thin-film substrates. Results revealed nearly identical positive secondary ion species for both EMI-BF4 and EMI-Im thin films, whereas EMI-Im produced a more diverse set of negative ions consistent with the greater chemical complexity of its anion. The analytical-grade SIMS spectra revealed many relatively high mass-to-charge ratio secondary ions likely below the detection limit for the laboratory diagnostic, thus shifting the average m/z value to above the monomer mass for most spectra. Finally, optical profilometry analysis reveals an estimated 0.5 nm/min sputter rate for an electrospray ion plume bombarding an ionic liquid thin film.</description>

      <title>Physical Computing at the Data Processing Inequality Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-physics-based intelligent sensing has driven multidisciplinary applications from smart industries to decision-making systems. Traditional sensing paradigms transform physical waveforms into human-understandable intermediate representations through preprocessing. Such transformations inherently cause information loss owing to data processing inequality (DPI). Here, we established a theoretical framework for physical computing at the DPI upper limit. Physical computing avoids information loss during preprocessing by directly extracting information from physical waveforms, achieving the theoretical maximum of accessible information as determined by the DPI. Furthermore, physical computing comprehensively utilizes multiple dimensions of physical waveforms, thereby enhancing the upper limit of information capture capability. Electromagnetic sensing experiments have demonstrated that physical computing can achieve 100% sensing accuracy, substantially outperforming traditional sensing paradigms. The proposed theoretical framework of physical computing offers a promising path towards enhancing the information-capture capability of next-generation intelligent sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Tailored Zn(1-x)TixAl2O4 Nanocomposite Particles via Sol-Gel Route for High-Performance Humidity Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humidity sensors play a vital role in industrial, healthcare, agricultural, and environmental applications; however, conventional sensors often suffer from issues like low sensitivity, slow response, and poor stability. This study investigates sol-gel synthesized Zn0.85Ti0.15Al2O4 nanocomposite ceramics for high-performance humidity sensing. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms a nanocrystalline structure, while the optical bandgap of 3.76 eV indicates the enhanced sensing potential. The sensor exhibits a significant decrease in resistance, from 500 M{\Omega} (15% RH) to 90 M{\Omega}(90% RH), with fast response (50 s) and recovery times (50 s). Low Hysteresis values (5.86% at 30% RH, 7.69% at 60% RH, and 4.28% at 90% RH) highlight high sensitivity, stability, and repeatability. These results indicate the potential of Zn0.85Ti0.15Al2O4as a promising material for next-generation resistive humidity sensors suitable for commercial and industrial deployment.</description>

      <title>Guided progressive reconstructive imaging: a new quantization-based framework for low-dose, high-throughput and real-time analytical ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By profiting from recent developments in detector technologies, making it possible to access a stream of detection events with few-ns time resolutions, a new ptychographic workflow is established. This methodological framework, referred to as guided progressive reconstructive imaging, relies on a quantization-based description of the acquired intensity, through an elementary derivation. Established direct phase retrieval solutions, such as the Wigner distribution deconvolution approach, can then be adapted to a continuous treatment of received counts, with no need for a dense data representation. Consequently, the result is obtained in the form of a progressively improving estimate, while providing immediate user feedback thanks to a remarkable processing speed, able to surpass the acquisition bandwidth. This fast measurement is enabled by the cumulative usage of a pre-calculated library of kernel-limited guide functions, compiling count-wise contributions as a function of the triggered detector pixel. Hence, the reconstruction offers the same advantages of direct phase retrieval methods, in particular a high dose-efficiency and the absence of complex convergence dynamics, with much less stringent restrictions on the field of view than is typical in current alternatives. Its implementation is also significantly more straightforward and flexible. Overall, this work constitutes a major evolution in the state-of-the-art, facilitating repeatable and low-dose experiments with high accessibility, and being applicable to electron-based imaging, X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy.</description>

      <title>Bound States to the Continuum: Time-varying Spoof Acoustic Surface Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for time-modulated acoustic metasurfaces comprising a line array of modulated cavities, and show that bound acoustic surface waves can undergo temporal diffraction from bound states localised at an interface into bulk waves. The dispersion relation is derived via an operator formalism that captures the spatio-temporal coupling between Floquet sidebands. We show that under periodic modulation of the cavity length sidebands spaced by the modulation frequency are produced (diffraction in time), enabling the coupling of bound surface acoustic waves with bulk radiation i.e. from a bound state \textit{to} the continuum. We observe the negative-frequency spectra as spatial reflections along the array via time-domain finite element simulations. Spectral $k$-gaps are observed at band crossings, with the width of the gap proportional to the modulation amplitude. The modulation enters solely through a time-dependent reflection phase, such that the framework applies generally to metasurfaces with programmable boundary conditions, beyond purely mechanical modulation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating field decay along nonlocal metasurfaces by suppressing the Norton wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the nature of electromagnetic fields of dipole sources over a homogeneous flat ground or impedance surfaces has a long history. In general, at a long distance $r$ from the source, the near-surface field is mostly contributed by the geometrical optics term (describing the radiation pattern), a guided wave, and the higher-order reactive contribution referred to as the Norton wave. In the special case of a perfect magnetic conductor interface, the first two terms vanish, so the residual Norton wave determines the steepest achievable field decay profile of $~r^{-3/2}$ (for a two-dimensional horizontal magnetic dipole). In this letter, we reveal that in the presence of a nonlocal metasurface described by the second-order impedance boundary condition, the field decay can be further accelerated by suppressing the Norton wave (approaching the profiles $r^{-5/2}$ and $r^{-7/2}$ for electric and magnetic fields, respectively). In a proposed practical realization of a nonlocal metasurface, the effect is numerically verified and shown to reduce the edge diffraction effects by 10 dB for the shield diameter of only one wavelength, paving the way toward compact antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Ptsingle bondRu overlays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of electrodeposited Pt, Ru and Pt-Ru overlays for high-temperature oxidation protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platinum (Pt) and ruthenium (Ru), both members of the platinum-group metals (PGMs), are renowned for their exceptional resistance to corrosion, oxidation, and high temperatures, making them promising candidates for advanced high-temperature applications. This study investigates the direct current (DC) electrodeposition of Pt, Ru, and a binary Pt-Ru alloy onto NiCoCrAlYTa-coated single-crystal superalloy CMSX-4, along with their vacuum annealing and respective effects on the isothermal oxidation behavior of the system at 1100 {\deg}C. All the electrodeposited overlays demonstrated substantial enhancement in oxidation resistance. However, Pt exhibited the highest protection efficiency, Ru the least, and the Pt-Ru alloy provided an intermediate level of performance. Microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the competitive formation of protective {\alpha}-Al2O3 and spinel NiAl2O4 phases on the coated surfaces played a crucial role in determining the oxidation resistance, driven by atomic interactions between the elements in the NiCoCrAlYTa bond coat and the overlay metals. Despite Ru's relatively lower oxidation resistance compared to Pt, its significantly lower cost offers potential advantages in cost-sensitive, high-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing Pt-group metal coatings for durability in high-performance systems.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>

      <title>Bandgap Engineering for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells Under Multiple Color Temperature Indoor Lighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite indoor photovoltaics (PIPVs) are emerging as a transformative technology for low-light intensity energy harvesting, owing to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), low-cost fabrication, solution-processability, and compositionally tunable band gaps. In this work, methylammonium-free perovskite absorbers were compositionally engineered to achieve band gaps of 1.55, 1.72, and 1.88 eV, enabling matching the spectral photoresponse with the indoor lighting. Devices based on a scalable mesoscopic n-i-p architecture were systematically evaluated under white LED illumination across correlated color temperatures (3000-5500 K) and light intensities from 250 to 1000 lux with active area of 1 cm2. The 1.72 eV composition exhibited the most promising performance across different light intensities and colors, achieving PCEs of 35.04 % at 1000 lux and 36.6 % at 250 lux, with a stable device operation of over 2000 hours. On the other hand, the 1.88 eV band-gap variant reached a peak PCE of 37.4 % under 250 lux (5500 K), however performance trade-offs were observed across the different color lights LEDs. Our combined experimental and theoretical optical-electrical simulations suggest that decreasing trap-assisted recombination in wide-bandgap compositions may further improve PIPV performance across the different illumination conditions. In contrast, devices with 1.55 eV band gap underperformed in such conditions due to suboptimal spectral overlap and utilization. These findings establish bandgap optimization and device architecture as key design principles for high-efficiency, stable PIPVs, advancing their integration into self-powered electronic systems and innovative indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic-enhanced Raman scattering in van der Waals MoOCl2: from Fano resonances to picomolar detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural van der Waals (vdW) crystals with hyperbolic dispersion challenge artificial metamaterials but remain confined to the mid-infrared spectrum. The emergence of MoOCl2, a quasi-one-dimensional metal with in-plane hyperbolicity, overcomes this spectral limit, shifting the focus to the practical visible range. Here, utilizing angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, we uncover a highly anisotropic vibrational response characterized by pronounced Fano resonances and polarization switching, which serve as signatures of strong coupling between phonons and the metallic continuum. Harnessing this interaction, we demonstrate "Hyperbolic-Enhanced Raman" (HypER) scattering, where MoOCl2 provides polarization-tunable enhancement factors exceeding 10^7 and picomolar-level detection down to 100 pM, without any nanostructuring. These results establish MoOCl2 as a simple, air-stable, wafer-compatible platform for visible-range hyperbolic nanophotonics and lithography-free sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop highly corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings for metallic components -- bipolar plates (BPPs) and porous transport layers (PTLs) -- in PEM water electrolyzers. Using reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), we deposit compact 200 nm bilayer coatings onto SS316L substrates, systematically tailoring their composition. By precisely controlling oxygen partial pressure and Nb/Ti ratio, we adjust stoichiometry and structure, directly affecting electrical resistivity and corrosion resistance. We examine interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and electrochemical parameters before and after accelerated corrosion testing. Optimized coatings exhibit resistivity on the order of 10^-4 Ohmcm and extremely low corrosion current densities (J_corr = 0.01-0.08 uA/cm^2), well below the U.S. DOE 2026 target. Most importantly, these coatings enable the ICR target after accelerated corrosion testing with a Pt overlayer as thin as 5 nm, reducing Pt loading by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches.</description>

Abstract: Donor-$\pi$-acceptor (D-$\pi$-A) functionalization of MOF linkers can enhance visible-light photocatalytic activity, yet the mechanisms responsible for these effects remain unclear. Here we combine EPR spectroscopy, transient photoluminescence, and first-principles calculations to examine how diazo-coupled anisole, diphenylamine (DPA), and N,N-dimethylaniline (NNDMA) groups modify the photophysics of UiO-66-NH$_2$. All donor units introduce new occupied states near the valence-band edge, enabling charge separation through dye-to-framework electron transfer. Among them, the anisole-modified material stands out for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing into a triplet charge-transfer configuration that suppresses fast recombination and yields long-lived charge carriers detectable by photo-EPR. Meanwhile, bulkier donors such as DPA and NNDMA - despite their stronger electron-donating character - also tend to introduce defect-associated trap states. These results underscore the interplay between donor-induced electronic-structure changes, triplet pathways, and defect-mediated recombination, offering a mechanistic basis for tuning photocatalytic response in D-$\pi$-A-modified MOFs.</description>

      <title>Two-photon light-sheet live imaging at kilohertz frame rate using birefringence-based pulse splitting</title>

Abstract: Multiphoton microscopy is widely used for live imaging. However, its acquisition speed remains limited by fluorophore emission rates and photodamage. To increase the pixel rate of a two-photon microscope beyond a few megahertz (MHz), multi-point parallelized schemes have been proposed. Two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy emerges as an effective approach for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live specimens, as it enables parallelized excitation while minimizing the required laser power. However, optimizing the signal-to-photodamage ratio in 2P light-sheet microscopy requires to precisely control the illumination parameters, including both wavelength and pulse frequency. Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos. We achieve kilohertz imaging frame rate, reaching more than 150 MHz pixel rates with fluorescent signal levels above 10 $photons.pixel^{-1}$ using a laser mean power and a peak intensity in the range of 100 mW and 0.1 $TW.cm^{-2}$ at the sample, respectively. This adjustable pulse-splitting scheme allows full advantage to be taken of light-sheet illumination for fast in vivo 2P imaging.</description>

      <title>Systematic search of laser and phase modulation noise coupling in heterodyne interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterodyne interferometry for precision science often comes with an optical phase modulation, for example, for intersatellite clock noise transfer for gravitational wave (GW) detectors in space, exemplified by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The phase modulation potentially causes various noise couplings to the final phase extraction of heterodyne beatnotes by a phasemeter. In this paper, in the format of space-based GW detectors, we establish an analytical framework to systematically search for the coupling of various noises from the heterodyne and modulation frequency bands, which are relatively unexplored so far. In addition to the noise caused by the phase modulation, the high-frequency laser phase noise is also discussed in the same framework. The analytical result is also compared with a numerical experiment to confirm that our framework successfully captures the major noise couplings. We also demonstrate a use case of this study by taking the LISA-like parameters as an example, which enables us to derive requirements on the level of the laser and phase modulation noises in the high frequency regimes.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Photonic Crystal Bolometer with Ultra-Low Heat Capacity for Scalable Thermal Imaging</title>

Abstract: High-speed thermal imaging in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) is critical for applications from autonomous navigation to medical screening, yet existing uncooled detectors are fundamentally constrained. Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators typically rely on vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation, and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $27~\mu \mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. Based on this detectivity measurement, which is limited by the noise floor of the external optical detection electronics, a physics-based model predicts a $&gt;25\text{-fold}$ performance enhancement to its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3\times10^{8}$ Jones). The optical readout remains functional across ambient and vacuum environments. We expect this architecture to provide a general route toward scalable, high-performance thermal imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Debt, Growth, and the Carbon Lock-In</title>

Abstract: Despite decades of climate policy and rapid improvements in energy efficiency, global CO2 emissions continue to rise, suggesting the presence of structural drivers that offset efficiency gains. Here we identify financial leverage as a key mechanism underpinning this persistent overshoot. We develop a stochastic macro-financial model linking credit dynamics, economic growth, bankruptcy risk, and cumulative carbon emissions. The model shows that debt-financed growth systematically amplifies cumulative emissions, locking economies into high-carbon trajectories even as emissions intensity declines. This arises from a double constraint: debt repayment requires sustained growth, while growth remains energy-dependent and thus generates emissions. When growth becomes increasingly dependent on leverage, financial instability and cumulative emissions rise, while gains in real wealth diminish, revealing a leverage frontier beyond which additional credit primarily generates risk. Calibrating the model to multi-decade data for the US, China, France and Denmark, we find a robust coupling between debt accumulation, cumulative GDP and cumulative emissions across distinct economic structures. These results indicate that achieving net-zero targets requires aligning credit allocation with decarbonisation objectives</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Mitigating Flux Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits-Couplers System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding the error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such improvement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the qubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step toward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux control (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and couplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein magnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits or couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux bias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In this study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a multiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout for couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits and couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise compensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line crosstalk from 56.5$\,$permille$\,$to 0.13$\,$permille$\,$ which is close to statistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading to a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free calculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a near-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and supporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</description>
