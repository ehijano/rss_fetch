      <title>Investigating the effectiveness of multimodal data in forecasting SARS-COV-2 case surges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior, remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features (e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological Machine Learning for Protein-Nucleic Acid Binding Affinity Changes Upon Mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how protein mutations affect protein-nucleic acid binding is critical for unraveling disease mechanisms and advancing therapies. Current experimental approaches are laborious, and computational methods remain limited in accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel topological machine learning model (TopoML) combining persistent Laplacian (from topological data analysis) with multi-perspective features: physicochemical properties, topological structures, and protein Transformer-derived sequence embeddings. This integrative framework captures robust representations of protein-nucleic acid binding interactions. To validate the proposed method, we employ two datasets, a protein-DNA dataset with 596 single-point amino acid mutations, and a protein-RNA dataset with 710 single-point amino acid mutations. We show that the proposed TopoML model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting mutation-induced binding affinity changes for protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes.</description>

      <title>Optimization and variability can coexist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological systems perform close to their physical limits, but promoting this optimality to a general principle seems to require implausibly fine tuning of parameters. Using examples from a wide range of systems, we show that this intuition is wrong. Near an optimum, functional performance depends on parameters in a "sloppy'' way, with some combinations of parameters being only weakly constrained. Absent any other constraints, this predicts that we should observe widely varying parameters, and we make this precise: the entropy in parameter space can be extensive even if performance on average is very close to optimal. This removes a major objection to optimization as a general principle, and rationalizes the observed variability.</description>

      <title>Initial Luminally Deposited FGF4 Critically Influences Blastocyst Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminogenesis, the formation of a fluid-filled cavity (lumen), is an essential process in early mammalian embryonic development, coinciding with the second cell-fate decision that differentiates the inner-cell-mass (ICM) into epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PRE) tissues. Based on experiments, the blastocyst lumen is hypothesized to influence EPI-PRE tissue specification, but its particular functional role remains theoretically underexplored. In this study, we extended our stochastic ICM differentiation model to incorporate both the blastocyst lumen (blastocoel) and the trophectoderm (TE) as adjacent compartments where the primary signaling protein (FGF4) for EPI-PRE differentiation can diffuse, degrade, or accumulate. This extended ICM model allows for a spatially resolved analysis of EPI-PRE lineage proportioning under the influence of luminally deposited FGF4 molecules. Our results reveal that the blastocoel acts as a localized signaling source, while the TE functions as an embryo-wide signaling sink, guiding cell-fate decisions within the ICM. A critical determinant of the ideal target system behavior is the initial amount of luminally deposited FGF4, which is required to recapitulate the correct spatio-temporal patterning of EPI and PRE (blastocyst) cell lineages. Notably, this requirement is independent of ICM population size and shape, highlighting the robustness of the FGF4 signaling process. Our study also underscores the potential of integrating single-cell gene expression and cell-cell communication dynamics simulations with tissue-level morphogenesis representations. By combining spatial-stochastic modeling with agent-based frameworks, we could enhance the exploration of the intricate interplay between gene regulation, signaling, and morphogenetic processes that govern early embryonic development.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretical Measures for Developmental Cell-Fate Proportioning Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organization is a fundamental process of complex biological systems, particularly during the early stages of development. In the mammalian embryo, blastocyst formation exemplifies a self-organized system, involving the correct spatio-temporal segregation of three distinct cell fates: trophectoderm (TE), epiblast (EPI), and primitive endoderm (PRE). Despite the significance of this class of processes, quantifying the information content of self-organizing patterning systems remains challenging due to the complexity and the qualitative diversity of developmental mechanisms. In this study, we applied a recently proposed information-theoretical framework which quantifies the self-organization potential of cell-fate patterning systems, employing a utility function that integrates (local) positional information and (global) correlational information extracted from developmental pattern ensembles. Specifically, we examined a stochastic and spatially resolved simulation model of EPI-PRE lineage proportioning, evaluating its information content across various simulation scenarios with different numbers of system cells. To overcome the computational challenges hindering the application of this novel framework, we developed a mathematical strategy that indirectly maps the low-dimensional cell-fate counting probability space to the high-dimensional cell-fate patterning probability space, enabling the estimation of self-organization potential for general cell-fate proportioning processes. Overall, this novel information-theoretical framework provides a promising, universal approach for quantifying self-organization in developmental biology. By formalizing measures of self-organization, the employed quantification framework offers a valuable tool for uncovering insights into the underlying principles of cell-fate specification and the emergence of complexity in early developmental systems.</description>

      <title>A Network-Guided Penalized Regression with Application to Proteomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network theory has proven invaluable in unraveling complex protein interactions. Previous studies have employed statistical methods rooted in network theory, including the Gaussian graphical model, to infer networks among proteins, identifying hub proteins based on key structural properties of networks such as degree centrality. However, there has been limited research examining a prognostic role of hub proteins on outcomes, while adjusting for clinical covariates in the context of high-dimensional data. To address this gap, we propose a network-guided penalized regression method. First, we construct a network using the Gaussian graphical model to identify hub proteins. Next, we preserve these identified hub proteins along with clinically relevant factors, while applying adaptive Lasso to non-hub proteins for variable selection. Our network-guided estimators are shown to have variable selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Simulation results suggest that our method produces better results compared to existing methods and demonstrates promise for advancing biomarker identification in proteomics research. Lastly, we apply our method to the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) data and identified hub proteins that may serve as prognostic biomarkers for various diseases, including rare genetic disorders and immune checkpoint for cancer immunotherapy.</description>

      <title>Fast uncovering of protein sequence diversity from structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present InvMSAFold, an inverse folding method for generating protein sequences that is optimized for diversity and speed. For a given structure, InvMSAFold generates the parameters of a probability distribution over the space of sequences with pairwise interactions, capturing the amino acid covariances observed in Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) of homologous proteins. This allows for the efficient generation of highly diverse protein sequences while preserving structural and functional integrity. We show that this increased diversity in sampled sequences translates into greater variability in biochemical properties, highlighting the exciting potential of our method for applications such as protein design. The orders of magnitude improvement in sampling speed compared to existing methods unlocks new possibilities for high-throughput virtual screening.</description>

      <title>CellFlux: Simulating Cellular Morphology Changes via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research. Project page: https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/CellFlux/.</description>

      <title>YH-MINER: Multimodal Intelligent System for Natural Ecological Reef Metric Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coral reefs, crucial for sustaining marine biodiversity and ecological processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, habitat provision), face escalating threats, underscoring the need for efficient monitoring. Coral reef ecological monitoring faces dual challenges of low efficiency in manual analysis and insufficient segmentation accuracy in complex underwater scenarios. This study develops the YH-MINER system, establishing an intelligent framework centered on the Multimodal Large Model (MLLM) for "object detection-semantic segmentation-prior input". The system uses the object detection module (mAP@0.5=0.78) to generate spatial prior boxes for coral instances, driving the segment module to complete pixel-level segmentation in low-light and densely occluded scenarios. The segmentation masks and finetuned classification instructions are fed into the Qwen2-VL-based multimodal model as prior inputs, achieving a genus-level classification accuracy of 88% and simultaneously extracting core ecological metrics. Meanwhile, the system retains the scalability of the multimodal model through standardized interfaces, laying a foundation for future integration into multimodal agent-based underwater robots and supporting the full-process automation of "image acquisition-prior generation-real-time analysis".</description>
