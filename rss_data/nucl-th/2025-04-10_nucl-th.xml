      <title>Non Nucleonic Components in Short Nuclear Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the important features of nuclear forces is their strong repulsive nature at short ($\le 0.5-0.6$~Fm) distances which prevents atomic nuclei from collapsing, thus guarantying the stability for the visible matter. However the dynamical nature of this repulsion (referred to as a nuclear core) is as elusive as ever. We present the study of nuclear dynamics at extremely large internal momenta in the deuteron dominated by the nuclear core. It is demonstrated that the paradigm shift in the description of the deuteron consisting of proton and neutron to the description of the deuteron as a pseudo-vector composite system in which proton and neutron is observed in high energy electro-disintegration processes results in the emergence of a new structure. We demonstrate that this new structure can exist only if it emerges from pre-existing non-nucleonic component in the deuteron. The study of the dynamics of the predicted new structure is presented focusing on the question if it allows to understand the anomaly observed in the recent experiment at Jefferson Lab that probed deuteron structure at internal momenta above 800 MeV/c.</description>

      <title>Double shape quantum phase transitions in the SU3-IBM (I) new $\gamma$-soft phase and the shape phase transition from the new $\gamma$-soft phase to the prolate shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape quantum phase transition is an important topic in nuclear structure. In this paper, we begin to study the shape quantum phase transition in the SU3-IBM. In this new proposed model, spherical-like spectra was found to resolve the spherical nucleus puzzle, which is a new $\gamma$-soft rotational mode. In this paper, the shape phase transition along the new $\gamma$-soft line is first discussed, and then the neighbouring case at the prolate side is also studied. We find that double shape phase transitions occur along a single parameter path. The new $\gamma$-softness is really a shape phase and the shape phase transition from the new $\gamma$-soft phase to the prolate shape is found. The experimental support is also found and $^{108}$Pd is the critical nucleus.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Extrapolating No-Core Shell Model Results to Infinite Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the machine learning to extrapolate to the infinite model space the no-core shell model (NCSM) results for the energies and rms radii of the 6He ground state and 6Li lowest states. The extrapolated energies and rms radii converge as the NCSM results from larger model spaces are included in the training dataset for ensemble of artificial neural networks thus enabling an accurate predictions for these observables.</description>

      <title>Antikaon condensed dense matter in neutron star with SU(3) flavour symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of massive pulsars suggest that the central density of neutron stars can exceed several times the nuclear saturation density, which is a favourable environment for the appearance of exotic states such as strange and non-strange baryons, meson condensates, and deconfined quark matter. The antikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson condensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms between antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we aim to determine hadron couplings in the mesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three key parameters we calculate $\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet meson $\omega_8$ and the singlet meson $\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to singlet couplings $z$; and leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric and antisymmetric couplings $\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its impact on the system. Using this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon interactions with both singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson family and examine the corresponding implications for dense matter featuring antikaon condensation. Our findings reveal that the equation of state for dense matter becomes progressively stiffer with increasing values of $\alpha_v$, which delays the onset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum achievable mass of neutron stars. This establishes a lower bound for $\alpha_v$ that is consistent with the observed minimum masses of pulsars.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approach to Study of Low Energy Alpha-Deuteron Elastic Scattering using Phase Function Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central idea: To obtain the interaction potential using the inverse scattering method, we have employed the Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) approach. In this framework, the machine learning algorithm is guided by the underlying physical laws, enabling the accurate extraction of the inverse scattering potential from the elastic scattering data. Methodology: As a reference potential, a combination of three smoothly joined Morse functions has been utilized, characterized by ten model parameters. These parameters are optimized in an iterative fashion using a Genetic Algorithm to ensure the best fit to the phase shifts extracted from the experimental scattering data. The process of optimization is guided by the computed scattering phase shifts by solving the phase equation using 5th order RK-method for the reference potential in each iteration Results: Our approach yields inverse potentials for both single and multi channel scattering. Using the Scattering Phase Shifts obtained from these inverse potentials, we calculate the partial cross-section to determine the resonance energies and decay width. The obtain values of resonance energies and decay width for 3D1, 3D2 and 3D3 states of alpha-deuteron are in correspondence with the experimental results. Conclusion: It can be concluded that our machine learning-based approach for constructing the inverse potential offers a novel and complementary technique to existing direct methods.</description>

      <title>Holographic hybrid stars with slow phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $D_3$-$D_7$ holographic model is used to describe the core of the hybrid star, composed by quark matter, while its crust is modeled from a hadronic relativistic mean field (RMF) model capable of reproducing low-energy nuclear physics data as well as some astrophysical observations. The $D_3$-$D_7$ brane configuration and the RMF model lead to an equation of state that is used to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. For different model parameters, the mass-radius diagram is presented. The conditions for the dynamic stability of stellar configurations are discussed, considering the radial oscillation criterion for hybrid stars with slow phase transitions. Strikingly, it is shown that the models generate stable star configurations with a core of quarks. We compare our results with NICER observational data for the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 and show that the compact stars generated from this method fall within the corresponding observational regions.</description>

      <title>High-order fluctuations of temperature in hot QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the temperature fluctuations in hot quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. A new thermodynamic state function is introduced to describe the mean transverse momentum fluctuations of charged particles in heavy-ion collisions, enabling analytic expressions for the temperature fluctuations of different orders. This formalism is applied to the QCD thermodynamics described by a 2+1 flavor low energy effective field theory within the functional renormalization group approach. It is found that the temperature fluctuations are suppressed remarkably as the matter is evolved from the phase of hadron resonance gas to the quark-gluon plasma phase with increasing temperature or baryon chemical potential, which is attributed to the significant increase of the heat capacity of matter. Furthermore, the same mechanism leads to a negative skewness in the temperature fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of nuclei at finite temperature is of immense interest for many areas of nuclear astrophysics and nuclear-reaction science. A variety of ab initio methods are now available for computing the properties of nuclei from interactions rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics, but applications have largely been limited to zero temperature. In the present work, we extend one such method, the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG), to finite temperature. Using an exactly-solvable schematic model that captures essential features of nuclear interactions, we show that the FT-IMSRG can accurately determine the energetics of nuclei at finite temperature, and we explore the accuracy of the FT-IMSRG in different parameter regimes, e.g., strong and weak pairing. In anticipation of FT-IMSRG applications for finite nuclei and infinite matter, we discuss differences arising from the choice of working with the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles. In future work, we will apply the FT-IMSRG with realistic nuclear interactions to compute nuclear structure and reaction properties at finite temperature, which are important ingredients for understanding nucleosynthesis in stellar environments, or modeling reactions of hot compound nuclei.</description>

      <title>Exploring hadron-quark phase transition in heavy-ion collisions using particle emission ratios in heavy and light reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the AMPT model, which incorporates both hadronic and quark degrees of freedom, we studied the productions of lambda, kaon, proton, and pion in reaction systems $^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca, and $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au. It is found that the ratios of identical particle emissions from heavy and light reaction systems, especially the emission ratios of strange particles $\Lambda^{0}$ or K$^{+}$ in heavy and light reaction systems, are highly sensitive to the hadron-quark phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. Detailed explanations and validations of these results are given.</description>

      <title>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not appear to agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield. The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit the mass of a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future observational studies of the inner solar system can not only refine these constraints but also help to identify and to assess the mass of its dark-matter component.</description>

      <title>Nature of X(3872) from recent BESIII data: Considering the universal feature of an S-wave threshold resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent data from the BESIII collaboration on the $X(3872)$ state in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ decay channels. The quantum number and mass of the $X(3872)$ state allow us to exploit the universal feature of the very near-threshold $D\bar D^*$ scattering in the $S$ wave. The analysis of $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ data and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ data separately as well as the combined analysis of these data together, all support the conclusion that $X(3872)$ is an extremely weakly bound charm meson molecule.</description>

      <title>Extending Israel-Stewart theory: Causal bulk viscosity at large gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a class of relativistic fluid models for cold and dense matter with bulk viscosity, whose equilibrium equation of state is polytropic. These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\Pi$. However, when $\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations "adjust" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$ on both density and temperature.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Chiral Symmetry within QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: That chiral symmetry is a crucial feature of the strong force was realized before the discovery of Quantum Chromodynamics. However, the full power it exerts on the structure of the nucleon became apparent only afterwards. We present a high-level and somewhat personal overview of its role in almost every aspect of proton structure, from its mass and spin to the asymmetry of its antimatter content and its strange quark content. The lessons learned from studying the proton are also vital with respect to the modern challenge of the nature of baryon excited states.</description>
