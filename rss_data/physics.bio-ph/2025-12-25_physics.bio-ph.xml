      <title>Geese achieve stationary takeoff via synergistic wing kinematics and enhanced aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary take-off, without a running start or elevated descent, requires substantial aerodynamic forces to overcome weight, particularly for large birds such as geese exceeding 2 kg. However, the complex wing motion and high-Reynolds-number (Re $\approx$$10^5$) flow dynamics challenge conventional expectations of avian flight aerodynamics, rendering this mechanism elusive. Analyzing 578 stationary take-offs from seven geese (\textit{Anser cygnoides}) and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we reveal that the complex wing kinematics collapse onto a low-dimensional manifold dominated by two synergies: a Stroke Synergy responsible for fundamental rhythmic stroke, and a Morphing Synergy governing spanwise geometry. This modular control strategy orchestrates a stereotyped wing kinematics featuring an accelerated translational downstroke and a rapid tip-reversal upstroke. By integrating wing kinematic analysis with the mass distribution of the geese, we quantified the aerodynamic forces and found that entirely positive lift and thrust are generated throughout the motion cycle. The enhanced aerodynamic performance of geese takeoff results from three principal mechanisms. During the downstroke, significant lift generated from wing acceleration is predicted by the quasi-steady framework. Flow visualization reveals that wake capture further enhances the lift generation in downstroke by orienting the position of wake vortices. During the upstroke, the distal wing performs a rapid pitching motion and generates a substantial thrust, the vertical component of which contributes significantly to weight support.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Uncertainty Quantification for Computational Point-of-care Sensors</title>

Abstract: Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.</description>

      <title>The unified cross-disciplinary model of the operation of neurons</title>

Abstract: Physics perfectly describes neuronal operation, provided that we take into account that biology uses slow, positively charged ions rather than electrons as charge carriers and remove untested ad hoc hypotheses that contradict science's first principles. We also incorporate recent experimental discoveries into the outdated classic theoretical description. Lipid mechanisms are really very important for cellular biology, but they are certainly not suitable for describing the phenomena we discuss. We introduce the correct physical model, significantly enhancing the classic \gls{HH} model; furthermore, the fundamentally bio-electrically triggered operation leads to changes in the electrical, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties of living matter. We derive the resting potential from first principles of science, showing that it is unrelated to an ad hoc linear combination of mobilities or reversal potentials, as the \gls{GHK} equation claims. Furthermore, we derive an "equivalent thermodynamic electric field" that enables discussion of, among others, the operation of ion channels, their ion selectivity, and voltage sensing. We demonstrate that a simple electrical-thermodynamic control circuit regulates neuronal operation, setting and maintaining a stable resting potential and handling an unstable transient process known as the \gls{AP}. Its setpoint entirely defines the resting potential, explaining its robustness during growth and evolution. Our cross-disciplinary approach naturally fuses the electrical and mechanical/thermodynamic description of neuronal operation, resolves the decades-old mystery of "heat absorption" and "leakage current" (with their far-reaching consequences), and derives the thermodynamic description of neural computing. We defy that science cannot describe life.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Matter in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03609</link>

Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane-subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>
