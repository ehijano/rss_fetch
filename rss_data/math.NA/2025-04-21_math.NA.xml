      <title>Analysis of a finite element method for PDEs in evolving domains with topological changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the first rigorous error analysis of an unfitted finite element method for a linear parabolic problem posed on an evolving domain $\Omega(t)$ that may undergo a topological change, such as, for example, a domain splitting. The domain evolution is assumed to be $C^2$-smooth away from a critical time $t_c$, at which the topology may change instantaneously. To accommodate such topological transitions in the error analysis, we introduce several structural assumptions on the evolution of $\Omega(t)$ in the vicinity of the critical time. These assumptions allow a specific stability estimate even across singularities. Based on this stability result we derive optimal-order discretization error bounds, provided the continuous solution is sufficiently smooth. We demonstrate the applicability of our assumptions with examples of level-set domains undergoing topological transitions and discuss cases where the analysis fails. The theoretical error estimate is confirmed by the results of a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Time discretization in convected linearized thermo-visco-elastodynamics at large displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fully-implicit time discretization (i.e. the backward Euler formula) is applied to compressible nonlinear dynamical models of thermo-viscoelastic solids in the Eulerian description, i.e. in the actual deforming configuration, formulated in terms of rates. The Kelvin-Voigt rheology or also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology (covering creep or plasticity) are considered, using the additive Green-Naghdi's decomposition of total strain into the elastic and the inelastic strains formulated in terms of (objective) rates exploiting the Zaremba-Jaumann time derivative. A linearized convective model at large displacements is considered, focusing on the case where the internal energy additively splits the (convex) mechanical and the thermal parts. The time-discrete suitably regularized scheme is devised. The numerical stability and, considering the multipolar 2nd-grade viscosity, also convergence towards weak solutions are proved, exploiting the convexity of the kinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum instead of velocity and estimating the temperature gradient from the entropy-like inequality.</description>

      <title>The Schur complements for $SDD_{1}$ matrices and their application to linear complementarity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new scaling method to study the Schur complements of $SDD_{1}$ matrices. Its core is related to the non-negative property of the inverse $M$-matrix, while numerically improving the Quotient formula. Based on the Schur complement and a novel norm splitting manner, we establish an upper bound for the infinity norm of the inverse of $SDD_{1}$ matrices, which depends solely on the original matrix entries. We apply the new bound to derive an error bound for linear complementarity problems of $B_{1}$-matrices. Additionally, new lower and upper bounds for the determinant of $SDD_{1}$ matrices are presented. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our results.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Performance of Mixed-Precision ILU(0)-Preconditioned Multiple-Precision Real and Complex Krylov Subspace Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods are linear solvers based on matrix-vector multiplications and vector operations. While easily parallelizable, they are sensitive to rounding errors and may experience convergence issues. ILU(0), an incomplete LU factorization with zero fill-in, is a well-known preconditioning technique that enhances convergence for sparse matrices. In this paper, we implement a double-precision and multiple-precision ILU(0) preconditioner, compatible with product-type Krylov subspace methods, and evaluate its performance.</description>

      <title>A note on unshifted lattice rules for high-dimensional integration in weighted unanchored Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short article studies a deterministic quasi-Monte Carlo lattice rule in weighted unanchored Sobolev spaces of smoothness $1$. Building on the error analysis by Kazashi and Sloan, we prove the existence of unshifted rank-1 lattice rules that achieve a worst-case error of $O(n^{-1/4}(\log n)^{1/2})$, with the implied constant independent of the dimension, under certain summability conditions on the weights. Although this convergence rate is inferior to the one achievable for the shifted-averaged root mean squared worst-case error, the result does not rely on random shifting or transformation and holds unconditionally without any conjecture, as assumed by Kazashi and Sloan.</description>

      <title>Kernel-learning parameter prediction and evaluation in algebraic multigrid method for several PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of kernel learning methods for parameter prediction and evaluation in the Algebraic Multigrid Method (AMG), focusing on several Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems. AMG is an efficient iterative solver for large-scale sparse linear systems, particularly those derived from elliptic and parabolic PDE discretizations. However, its performance heavily relies on numerous parameters, which are often set empirically and are highly sensitive to AMG's effectiveness. Traditional parameter optimization methods are either computationally expensive or lack theoretical support. To address this, we propose a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based strategy to optimize AMG parameters and introduce evaluation metrics to assess their effectiveness. Trained on small-scale datasets, GPR predicts nearly optimal parameters, bypassing the time-consuming parameter sweeping process. We also use kernel learning techniques to build a kernel function library and determine the optimal kernel function through linear combination, enhancing prediction accuracy. In numerical experiments, we tested typical PDEs such as the constant-coefficient Poisson equation, variable-coefficient Poisson equation, diffusion equation, and Helmholtz equation. Results show that GPR-predicted parameters match grid search results in iteration counts while significantly reducing computational time. A comprehensive analysis using metrics like mean squared error, prediction interval coverage, and Bayesian information criterion confirms GPR's efficiency and reliability. These findings validate GPR's effectiveness in AMG parameter optimization and provide theoretical support for AMG's practical application.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed the full discretization of the Stochastic semilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by multiplicative Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and the stochastic trigonometric method for time discretization and derive a strong convergence rate with respect to both parameters (temporal and spatial). Numerical experiments have also been performed to support theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Quaternion Toeplitz Matrices by Quaternion-valued Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hermitian quaternion Toeplitz matrices generated by quaternion-valued functions. We show that such generating function must be the sum of a real-valued function and an odd function with imaginary component. This setting is different from the case of Hermitian complex Toeplitz matrices generated by real-valued functions only. By using of 2-by-2 block complex representation of quaternion matrices, we give a quaternion version of Grenander-Szeg\"{o} theorem stating the distribution of eigenvalues of Hermitian quaternion Toeplitz matrices in terms of its generating function. As an application, we investigate Strang's circulant preconditioners for Hermitian quaternion Toeplitz linear systems arising from quaternion signal processing. We show that Strang's circulant preconditioners can be diagionalized by discrete quaternion Fourier transform matrices whereas general quaternion circulant matrices cannot be diagonalized by them. Also we verify the theoretical and numerical convergence results of Strang's circulant preconditioned conjugate gradient method for solving Hermitian quaternion Toeplitz systems.</description>

      <title>Application of Sensitivity Analysis Methods for Studying Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the capabilities of several methods for analyzing the sensitivity of neural networks to perturbations of the input data and interpreting their underlying mechanisms. The investigated approaches include the Sobol global sensitivity analysis, the local sensitivity method for input pixel perturbations and the activation maximization technique. As examples, in this study we consider a small feedforward neural network for analyzing an open tabular dataset of clinical diabetes data, as well as two classical convolutional architectures, VGG-16 and ResNet-18, which are widely used in image processing and classification. Utilization of the global sensitivity analysis allows us to identify the leading input parameters of the chosen tiny neural network and reduce their number without significant loss of the accuracy. As far as global sensitivity analysis is not applicable to larger models we try the local sensitivity analysis and activation maximization method in application to the convolutional neural networks. These methods show interesting patterns for the convolutional models solving the image classification problem. All in all, we compare the results of the activation maximization method with popular Grad-CAM technique in the context of ultrasound data analysis.</description>

      <title>Artificial compressibility method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel artificial compressibility technique to approximate the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable fluid properties such as density and dynamical viscosity. The proposed scheme used the couple pressure and momentum, equal to the density times the velocity, as primary unknowns. It also involves an adequate treatment of the diffusive operator such that treating the nonlinear convective term explicitly leads to a scheme with time independent stiffness matrices that is suitable for pseudo-spectral methods. The stability and temporal convergence of the semi-implicit version of the scheme is established under the hypothesis that the density is approximated with a method that conserves the minimum-maximum principle. Numerical illustrations confirm that both the semi-implicit and explicit scheme are stable and converge with order one under classic CFL condition. Moreover, the proposed scheme is shown to perform better than a momentum based pressure projection method, previously introduced by one of the authors, on setups involving gravitational waves and immiscible multi-fluids in a cylinder.</description>

      <title>Poroelastic flow across a permeable interface: a Hamilton's principle approach and its finite element implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fluid flow across a permeable interface within a deformable porous medium. We use mixture theory. The mixture's constituents are assumed to be incompressible in their pure form. We use Hamilton's principle to obtain the governing equations, and we propose a corresponding finite element implementation. The filtration velocity and the pore pressure are allowed to be discontinuous across the interface while some control of these discontinuities is built into the interfacial constitutive behavior. To facilitate the practical implementation of the formulation in a finite element scheme, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier field over the interface for the explicit enforcement of the jump condition of the balance of mass. Our formulation appears to recover some basic results from the literature. The novelty of the work is the formulation of an approach that can accommodate specific constitutive assumptions pertaining to the behavior of the interface that do not necessarily imply the continuity of the filtration velocity and/or of the pore pressure across it.</description>

      <title>An $rp$-adaptive method for accurate resolution of shock-dominated viscous flow based on implicit shock tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an optimization-based $rp$-adaptive numerical method to approximate solutions of viscous, shock-dominated flows using implicit shock tracking and a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization on traditionally coarse grids without nonlinear stabilization (e.g., artificial viscosity or limiting). The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking methods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution discontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers, functioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of $r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual with respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the grid. Several innovations to the shock tracking optimization solver are proposed to ensure sufficient mesh compression at viscous features to render stabilization unnecessary, including residual weighting, step constraints and modifications, and viscosity-based continuation. Finally, $p$-adaptivity is used to locally increase the polynomial degree with three clear benefits: (1) lessens the mesh compression requirements near shock waves and boundary layers, (2) reduces the error in regions where $r$-adaptivity is not sufficient with the given grid topology, and (3) reduces computational cost by performing a majority of the $r$-adaptivity iterations on the coarsest discretization. A series of numerical experiments show the proposed method effectively resolves viscous, shock-dominated flows, including accurate prediction of heat flux profiles produced by hypersonic flow over a cylinder, and compares favorably in terms of accuracy per degree of freedom to $h$-adaptation with a high-order discretization.</description>

      <title>Phase-separated lipid vesicles: continuum modeling, simulation, and validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a complete research cycle comprising continuum-based modeling, computational framework development, and validation setup to predict phase separation and surface hydrodynamics in lipid bilayer membranes. We starting with an overview of the key physical characteristics of lipid bilayers, including their composition, mechanical properties, and thermodynamics, and then discuss continuum models of multi-component bilayers. The most complex model is a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard (NSCH) type system, describing the coupling of incompressible surface fluid dynamics with phase-field dynamics on arbitrarily curved geometries. It is discretized using trace finite element methods, which offer geometric flexibility and stability in representing surface PDEs. Numerical studies are conducted to examine physical features such as coarsening rates and interfacial dynamics. The computational results obtained from the NSCH model are compared against experimental data for membrane compositions with distinct phase behaviors, demonstrating that including both phase-field models and surface hydrodynamics is essential to accurately reproduce domain evolution observed in epi-fluorescence microscopy. Lastly, we extend the model to incorporate external forces that enable the simulation of vesicles containing cationic lipids, used to enhance membrane fusion.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a particle system for the calibrated Heston-type local stochastic volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a Monte Carlo particle method for the simulation of the calibrated Heston-type local stochastic volatility (H-LSV) model. The common application of a kernel estimator for a conditional expectation in the calibration condition results in a McKean-Vlasov (MV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) with non-standard coefficients. The primary challenges lie in certain mean-field terms in the drift and diffusion coefficients and the $1/2$-H\"{o}lder regularity of the diffusion coefficient. We establish the well-posedness of this equation for a fixed but arbitrarily small bandwidth of the kernel estimator. Moreover, we prove a strong propagation of chaos result, ensuring convergence of the particle system under a condition on the Feller ratio and up to a critical time. For the numerical simulation, we employ an Euler-Maruyama scheme for the log-spot process and a full truncation Euler scheme for the CIR volatility process. Under certain conditions on the inputs and the Feller ratio, we prove strong convergence of the Euler-Maruyama scheme with rate $1/2$ in time, up to a logarithmic factor. Numerical experiments illustrate the convergence of the discretisation scheme and validate the propagation of chaos in practice.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model order reduction for T-Product-Based dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model order reduction plays a crucial role in simplifying complex systems while preserving their essential dynamic characteristics, making it an invaluable tool in a wide range of applications, including robotic systems, signal processing, and fluid dynamics. However, traditional model order reduction techniques like balanced truncation are not designed to handle tensor data directly and instead require unfolding the data, which may lead to the loss of important higher-order structural information. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for data-driven model order reduction of T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), which are often used to capture the evolution of third-order tensor data such as images and videos through the T-product. Specifically, we develop advanced T-product-based techniques, including T-balanced truncation, T-balanced proper orthogonal decomposition, and the T-eigensystem realization algorithm for input-output TPDSs by leveraging the unique properties of T-singular value decomposition. We demonstrate that these techniques offer significant memory and computational savings while achieving reduction errors that are comparable to those of conventional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is further validated through synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Data-driven Topology Design Methodology with Multi-level Mesh and Correlation-based Mutation for Stress-related Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) serves as a widely applied structural design approach to tackle various engineering problems. Nevertheless, sensitivity-based TO methods usually struggle with solving strongly nonlinear optimization problems. By leveraging high capacity of deep generative model, which is an influential machine learning technique, the sensitivity-free data-driven topology design (DDTD) methodology is regarded as an effective means of overcoming these issues. The DDTD methodology depends on initial dataset with a certain regularity, making its results highly sensitive to initial dataset quality. This limits its effectiveness and generalizability, especially for optimization problems without priori information. In this research, we proposed a multi-level mesh DDTD-based method with correlation-based mutation module to escape from the limitation of the quality of the initial dataset on the results and enhance computational efficiency. The core is to employ a correlation-based mutation module to assign new geometric features with physical meaning to the generated data, while utilizing a multi-level mesh strategy to progressively enhance the refinement of the structural representation, thus avoiding the maintenance of a high degree-of-freedom (DOF) representation throughout the iterative process. The proposed multi-level mesh DDTD-based method can be driven by a low quality initial dataset without the need for time-consuming construction of a specific dataset, thus significantly increasing generality and reducing application difficulty, while further lowering computational cost of DDTD methodology. Various comparison experiments with the traditional sensitivity-based TO methods on stress-related strongly nonlinear problems demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: Approximation and Learning Guarantees for Functions and their Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha &lt; s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.</description>

      <title>GPU Optimizations for the Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents GPU optimizations for the 2D Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov (HPS) discretization scheme. HPS is a multi-domain spectral collocation method that combines high-order discretizations with direct solvers to accurately resolve highly oscillatory solutions. The domain decomposition approach of HPS connects domains directly via a sparse direct solver. The proposed optimizations exploit batched linear algebra on modern hybrid architectures, are straightforward to implement, and improve the solver's practical speed. The manuscript demonstrates that GPU optimizations can significantly reduce the traditionally high cost of performing local static condensation for discretizations with very high local order $p$. Numerical experiments for the Helmholtz equation with high wavenumbers on curved and rectangular domains confirm the high accuracy achieved by the HPS discretization and the significant reduction in computation time achieved with GPU optimizations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis via pseudo-reversing and applications to manifold-valued sequences</title>

Abstract: Modeling data using manifold values is a powerful concept with numerous advantages, particularly in addressing nonlinear phenomena. This approach captures the intrinsic geometric structure of the data, leading to more accurate descriptors and more efficient computational processes. However, even fundamental tasks like compression and data enhancement present meaningful challenges in the manifold setting. This paper introduces a multiscale transform that aims to represent manifold-valued sequences at different scales, enabling novel data processing tools for various applications. Similar to traditional methods, our construction is based on a refinement operator that acts as an upsampling operator and a corresponding downsampling operator. Inspired by Wiener's lemma, we term the latter as the reverse of the former. It turns out that some upsampling operators, for example, least-squares-based refinement, do not have a practical reverse. Therefore, we introduce the notion of pseudo-reversing and explore its analytical properties and asymptotic behavior. We derive analytical properties of the induced multiscale transform and conclude the paper with numerical illustrations showcasing different aspects of the pseudo-reversing and two data processing applications involving manifolds.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model reduction of dynamical systems with root mean squared error</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>Distributed computing for physics-based data-driven reduced modeling at scale: Application to a rotating detonation rocket engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) has revolutionized our ability to perform detailed simulations of complex real-world processes. A prominent contemporary example is from aerospace propulsion, where HPC is used for rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) simulations in support of the design of next-generation rocket engines; however, these simulations take millions of core hours even on powerful supercomputers, which makes them impractical for engineering tasks like design exploration and risk assessment. Data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) aim to address this limitation by constructing computationally cheap yet sufficiently accurate approximations that serve as surrogates for the high-fidelity model. This paper contributes a distributed memory algorithm that achieves fast and scalable construction of predictive physics-based ROMs trained from sparse datasets of extremely large state dimension. The algorithm learns structured physics-based ROMs that approximate the dynamical systems underlying those datasets.This enables model reduction for problems at a scale and complexity that exceeds the capabilities of standard, serial approaches. We demonstrate our algorithm's scalability using up to $2,048$ cores on the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. We focus on a real-world three-dimensional RDRE for which one millisecond of simulated physical time requires one million core hours on a supercomputer. Using a training dataset of $2,536$ snapshots each of state dimension $76$ million, our distributed algorithm enables the construction of a predictive data-driven reduced model in just $13$ seconds on $2,048$ cores on Frontera.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the inverse source problem for fractional diffusion-wave equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the inverse source problem for the fractional diffusion-wave equation, characterized by a source comprising spatial and temporal components. The investigation is primarily concerned with practical scenarios where data is collected subsequent to an incident. We establish the uniqueness of either the spatial or the temporal component of the source, provided that the temporal component exhibits an asymptotic expansion at infinity. Taking anomalous diffusion as a typical example, we gather the asymptotic behavior of one of the following quantities: the concentration on partial interior region or at a point inside the region, or the flux on partial boundary or at a point on the boundary. The proof is based on the asymptotic expansion of the solution to the fractional diffusion-wave equation. Notably, our approach does not rely on the conventional vanishing conditions for the source components. We also observe that the extent of uniqueness is dependent on the fractional order.</description>

      <title>Minimization of the Pseudospectral Abscissa of a Quadratic Matrix Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on parameters and a given tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa over the set of permissible parameter values is discussed, with applications in damping optimization and brake squeal reductions in mind. An approach is introduced that is based on nonsmooth and global optimization (or smooth optimization techniques such as BFGS if there are many parameters) equipped with a globally convergent criss-cross algorithm to compute the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa objective when the matrix polynomial is of small size. For the setting when the matrix polynomial is large, a subspace framework is introduced, and it is argued formally that it solves the minimization problem globally. The subspace framework restricts the parameter-dependent matrix polynomial to small subspaces, and thus solves the minimization problem for such restricted small matrix polynomials. It then expands the subspaces using the minimizers for the restricted polynomials. The proposed approach makes the global minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa possible for a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on a few parameters and for sizes up to at least a few hundreds. This is illustrated on several examples originating from damping optimization.</description>

      <title>$L_2$-approximation using randomized lattice algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a randomized lattice algorithm for approximating multivariate periodic functions over the $d$-dimensional unit cube from the weighted Korobov space with mixed smoothness $\alpha &gt; 1/2$ and product weights $\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\ldots\in [0,1]$. Building upon the deterministic lattice algorithm by Kuo, Sloan, and Wo\'{z}niakowski (2006), we incorporate a randomized quadrature rule by Dick, Goda, and Suzuki (2022) to accelerate the convergence rate. This randomization involves drawing the number of points for function evaluations randomly, and selecting a good generating vector for rank-1 lattice points using the randomized component-by-component algorithm. We prove that our randomized algorithm achieves a worst-case root mean squared $L_2$-approximation error of order $M^{-\alpha/2 - 1/8 + \varepsilon}$ for an arbitrarily small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $M$ denotes the maximum number of function evaluations, and that the error bound is independent of the dimension $d$ if the weights satisfy $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \gamma_j^{1/\alpha} &lt; \infty$. Our upper bound converges faster than a lower bound on the worst-case $L_2$-approximation error for deterministic rank-1 lattice-based approximation proved by Byrenheid, K\"{a}mmerer, Ullrich, and Volkmer (2017). We also show a lower error bound of order $M^{-\alpha/2-1/2}$ for our randomized algorithm, leaving a slight gap between the upper and lower bounds open for future research.</description>

      <title>A combined Lax-Wendroff/interpolation approach with finite element method for a three-dimensional system of tectonic deformation model: application to landslides in Cameroon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an efficient computational technique to assess the landslide responses to tectonic deformation and to predict the implications of large bedrocks landslides on the short and long-term development of the disasters. The considered equations represent a three-dimensional system of geological structure deformation subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions. The space derivatives are approximated using the finite element procedure while the approximation in time derivative is obtained using the Lax-Wendroff and interpolation techniques. The new approach is so called a combined Lax-Wendroff/interpolation method with finite element method. The modified Lax-Wendroff/interpolation scheme is employed to efficiently treat the time derivative term and to provide a suitable time step restriction for stability. Under this time step requirement, both stability and error estimates of the new algorithm are deeply analyzed using a constructed strong norm. The theory suggests that the developed computational technique is second-order accurate in time and spatial convergent with order O(h^{p}), where $h$ denotes the space size and p is a positive integer. A wide set of numerical examples are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and to demonstrate the utility and validity of the proposed numerical scheme. An application to landslides observed in west and center regions in Cameroon from October 2019 to November 2024, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an anisotropic goal-oriented error estimator based on the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) method for time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations. Using anisotropic interpolation operators the estimator is elementwise separated with respect to the single directions in space and time leading to adaptive, anisotropic mesh refinement in a natural way. To prevent spurious oscillations the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method is applied to stabilize the underlying system in the case of high P\'eclet numbers. Efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithm are demonstrated for different goal functionals. The directional error indicators quantify anisotropy of the solution with respect to the goal, and produce meshes that efficiently capture sharp layers. Numerical examples show the superiority of the proposed approach over isotropic adaptive and global mesh refinement using established benchmarks for convection-dominated transport.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Adaptive Gradient Algorithms for Nonconvex-PL Minimax Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimax optimization recently is widely applied in many machine learning tasks such as generative adversarial networks, robust learning and reinforcement learning. In the paper, we study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization with nonsmooth regularization, where the objective function is possibly nonconvex on primal variable $x$, and it is nonconcave and satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on dual variable $y$. Moreover, we propose a class of enhanced momentum-based gradient descent ascent methods (i.e., MSGDA and AdaMSGDA) to solve these stochastic nonconvex-PL minimax problems. In particular, our AdaMSGDA algorithm can use various adaptive learning rates in updating the variables $x$ and $y$ without relying on any specifical types. Theoretically, we prove that our methods have the best known sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ only requiring one sample at each loop in finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. Some numerical experiments on PL-game and Wasserstein-GAN demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo with Domain Transformation for Efficient Fourier Pricing of Multi-Asset Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently pricing multi-asset options poses a significant challenge in quantitative finance. Fourier methods leverage the regularity properties of the integrand in the Fourier domain to accurately and rapidly value options that typically lack regularity in the physical domain. However, most of the existing Fourier approaches face hurdles in high-dimensional settings due to the tensor product (TP) structure of the commonly employed numerical quadrature techniques. To overcome this difficulty, this work advocates using the randomized quasi-MC (RQMC) quadrature to improve the scalability of Fourier methods with high dimensions. The RQMC technique benefits from the smoothness of the integrand and alleviates the curse of dimensionality while providing practical error estimates. Nonetheless, the applicability of RQMC on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^d$, requires a domain transformation to $[0,1]^d$, which may result in singularities of the transformed integrand at the corners of the hypercube, and hence deteriorate the performance of RQMC. To circumvent this difficulty, we design an efficient domain transformation procedure based on boundary growth conditions on the transformed integrand. The proposed transformation preserves sufficient regularity of the original integrand for fast convergence of the RQMC method. To validate our analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of employing RQMC with an appropriate transformation to evaluate options in the Fourier space for various pricing models, payoffs, and dimensions. Finally, we highlight the computational advantage of applying RQMC over MC or TP in the Fourier domain, and over MC in the physical domain for options with up to 15 assets.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Probability Flow ODE for Score-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for sampling high-dimensional probability distributions. Despite their effectiveness, their theoretical underpinnings remain relatively underdeveloped. In this work, we study the convergence properties of deterministic samplers based on probability flow ODEs from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Assuming access to $L^2$-accurate estimates of the score function, we prove the total variation between the target and the generated data distributions can be bounded above by $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2})$ in the continuous time level, where $d$ denotes the data dimension and $\delta$ represents the $L^2$-score matching error. For practical implementations using a $p$-th order Runge-Kutta integrator with step size $h$, we establish error bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2} + d\cdot(dh)^p)$ at the discrete level. Finally, we present numerical studies on problems up to 128 dimensions to verify our theory.</description>

      <title>Pychop: Emulating Low-Precision Arithmetic in Numerical Methods and Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.

      <title>Stochastic momentum ADMM for nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization with application to PnP algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes SMADMM, a single-loop Stochastic Momentum Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for solving a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth composite optimization problems. SMADMM achieves the optimal oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ in the online setting. Unlike previous stochastic ADMM algorithms that require large mini-batches or a double-loop structure, SMADMM uses only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ stochastic gradient evaluations per iteration and avoids costly restarts. To further improve practicality, we incorporate dynamic step sizes and penalty parameters, proving that SMADMM maintains its optimal complexity without the need for large initial batches. We also develop PnP-SMADMM by integrating plug-and-play priors, and establish its theoretical convergence under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments on classification, CT image reconstruction, and phase retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing stochastic ADMM methods both in accuracy and efficiency, validating our theoretical results.</description>
