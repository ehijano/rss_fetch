      <title>Master field equations for spherically symmetric gravitational fields beyond general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I construct a set of master field equations encompassing all possible second-order field equations for spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity. The structure of 2-dimensional Horndeski theory is leveraged to define a spherically symmetric gravitational tensor that is identically conserved and can play an equivalent role as the Einstein tensor in the coupling to spherically symmetric stress-energy tensors. The master field equations provide a framework in which to study a wide variety of previously intractable problems and prove general results across different theories, as illustrated with the example of the Jebsen--Birkhoff theorem that holds generally. This work sets up the stage for the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity and provides powerful tools for the exploration of a new paradigm of black hole physics.</description>

      <title>dot-PE: Sampler-free gravitational wave inference using matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.</description>

      <title>Ultrarelativistic limit of the Kerr theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Kerr theorem provides the foundation for Kerr-Schild transformations by classifying all shear-free and geodesic null congruences in flat spacetime; the key ingredient of the Kerr-Schild ansatz. However, due to the high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its symmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically significant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example is the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to lead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we propose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the stationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance under null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions, the classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence is covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields an axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave displays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the exterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a special case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild black hole. The Kerr-Schild transformation of the second congruence gives rise to a non-trivial vacuum solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 112, 024020 (2025)]. Using circularity and appropriately fixing the reparameterization invariance of the orthogonal manifold to the Killing fields, we show that the latter solution corresponds to the well-known Taub-NUT spacetime with planar topology. These results emphasize how symmetry-based refinements of the Kerr theorem constitute a powerful tool to constructing physically essential spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on quantum entanglement and coherence in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains undetected, and developing theoretical models such as the promising perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is a key challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we investigate the quantum characteristics of PFDM by analyzing the behavior of quantum entanglement and coherence for both fermionic and bosonic fields near a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a PFDM halo. Our results reveal that PFDM can either enhance or degrade quantum entanglement and coherence, depending sensitively on its density. Notably, bosonic entanglement shows greater susceptibility to PFDM effects compared to fermionic entanglement, while fermionic coherence exhibits a stronger dependence on PFDM than its bosonic counterpart. These findings highlight the necessity of selecting appropriate quantum probes for DM detection based on the type of quantum resources, as different quantum fields exhibit significantly different responses to PFDM in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Emergent field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniqueness theorems for general relativity and Yang-Mills theories can be circumvented by dropping the ubiquitous, yet often implicit, assumption that physical fields, such as the spacetime metric, are fundamental. The novel concept of emergent fields makes it possible to construct modified theories of gravity and forces where the spacetime metric and strength tensor fields emerge from a covariance analysis in the canonical formulation with nontrivial relations to the fundamental phase space and no additional degrees of freedom are required. This is an example of a post-Einstein-Yang-Mills theory that implies new physics. In particular, explicit realizations of the theory in symmetry-reduced systems have shown robust resolutions of the singularities that plague the classical theories in regions of extreme spacetime curvature, including nonsingular (SU(2)xU(1)-charged) black holes with a cosmologial constant and collapsing solutions, as well as Gowdy and FLRW cosmologies. Further applications include modifications in the spectrum of quasinormal modes and in the evaporation process of black holes, as well as relativistic formulations of long-range gravitational effects capable of modeling MOND as an alternative solution to the dark matter problem. New results here include an extension of the spherically symmetric system that couples SU(2) gauge fields and the generalization of previous dynamical, homogeneous solutions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Fluid Dynamics in Curved Spacetime: a Novel Effective Hamiltonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Eulerian (Hamiltonian) framework for relativistic fluid dynamics in curved spacetimes, with emphasis on Schwarzschild geometry. The key innovation lies in the consistent use of density and three-velocity fields, all defined in coordinate (Newtonian) time, while fully incorporating relativistic and curvature effects. {\it We stress that the entire dynamics is developed in coordinate (Eulerian) time, from the viewpoint of a static Eulerian observer.} In the non-relativistic regime, it is well known that Poisson brackets between the density $\rho(\vec{x}, t)$ and velocity fields $v^i(\vec{x}, t)$, together with an appropriate Hamiltonian, yield the continuity and Euler equations as Hamiltonian equations of motion. These field-theoretic Poisson brackets can be derived from canonical phase-space brackets defined on Lagrangian variables $(x_i, p_j)$, mapped to Eulerian fields $(\rho, v^i)$. We extend this framework to curved spacetime by constructing a relativistic version of the Eulerian Poisson algebra and proposing a corresponding Hamiltonian. This yields relativistic continuity and Euler equations valid in generic spacetimes, with evolution in coordinate time. Applying this to the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain exact stationary background solutions for radial flows and perform a perturbative stability analysis. We also introduce a generalised vorticity and examine its effect on perturbations over irrotational backgrounds, revealing its role in flow stability. This work offers a unified, first-principles Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic fluid dynamics in curved geometries, forming a foundation for further study of astrophysical and cosmological fluid phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dehnen-type dark matter wormholes in the $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{L}_m,\mathcal{T})$ action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are exploring the possibility of traversable wormholes existing in a more realistic context. Specifically, we are looking at scenarios that don't rely on exotic factors, like having a mass shell at the throat or allowing particles and antiparticles to coexist without annihilation. To do this, we are constructing wormholes with double power-law density distributions, drawing inspiration from the Dehnen-type dark matter halo in the framework of generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity. Our investigation carefully considers the challenges of traversability and stability, as well as the roles of exotic matter, the exoticity parameter, and the anisotropy parameter. We have discovered solutions that describe asymmetric, asymptotically flat traversable wormholes, supported by a smooth metric and double power-law density distributions. These solutions successfully avoid the problems, giving us hope that such wormholes could actually exist in nature.</description>

      <title>From a collapsing radiating star to an evaporating black hole: A smooth transition from classical to quantum entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust mechanism where the geometrical free-gravitational entropy of an isolated astrophysical radiating star undergoing continual gravitational collapse, as measured by an external observer, makes a smooth transition to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the onset of the horizon formation and in the late times of black hole evaporation. It is interesting to note that both in the classical regime and the semi classical evaporating black hole regime, the matter is radiated via the Vaidya exterior surrounding the radiating star, as well as the evaporating black hole. Our result, being independent of the interior matter dynamics of the collapsing star, clearly indicates that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its non-extensive nature indeed originates from the Riemannian geometry, which dictates the free-gravity entropy in general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal modes arise as eigenmodes of a non-normal Hamiltonian and consequently they do not obey orthogonality relations with respect to commonly used inner products, for example, the energy inner product. A direct consequence of this is the appearance of transient phenomena. This review summarises current developments on the topic, both in frequency- and time-domain. In particular, we discuss the appearance of i) transient plateaus: arbitrarily long-lived sums of quasinormal modes, corresponding to localised energy packets near the future horizon; ii) transient growth, with the latter either appearing in the vicinity of black hole phase transitions or in the context of higher-derivative Sobolev norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the weak-field deflection of light in the scalar hairy black hole spacetime with scalar charge $Q_s$ and bumblebee gravity black hole spacetime, characterized by a Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$. Starting from the metric, we derive the photon orbit equation up to second order in the small parameters $M/b$, $Q_s$ or $\ell$. Then we derive the weak-field deflection angle via three independent semi-analytical techniques- (1) Homotopy-Perturbation Method, (2) Variational Iteration Method, (3) Single-Impulse (Transverse-Kick) Method-are each applied in full detail. We demonstrate exact agreement among these approaches and discuss their relative computational efficiencies, thereby offering diverse tools for lensing calculations in spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analog spacetimes from nonlinear perturbations in a topological material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent spacetime analogs in condensed matter systems have opened a fascinating window into simulating aspects of gravitational physics in controlled laboratory environments. In this work, we develop a comprehensive nonlinear analog gravity framework within a topological material, incorporating the impact of Berry curvature on the hydrodynamic flow of electrons. Unlike prevalent studies in existing literature limited to linear perturbations, we derive and analyze a fully nonlinear wave equation governing radial perturbations of density and velocity fields, which dynamically generate an effective acoustic metric. Taking the example of graphene as a representative system, and calculating its properties from first principles, we numerically demonstrate the formation of evolving acoustic horizons and quantify analog Hawking temperatures in experimentally accessible regimes. Our findings suggest that topological materials can serve as versatile platforms to probe rich gravitational phenomena, including horizon dynamics and quasi-thermal emission, beyond conventional linear approximations. This work lays the groundwork for exploring nonlinear emergent spacetime in a broad class of quantum materials, bridging condensed matter physics and gravitational analogs.</description>

      <title>Shadows from thin accretion disks of parametrized black hole solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the optical appearance from thin accretion disks in parametrized black holes, namely, solutions characterized by an arbitrarily large number of parameters without any regards to the theory of the gravitational and matter fields they come from. More precisely, we consider the leading-order terms of the spherically symmetric Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) and Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) parametrizations after imposing constraints from asymptotic flatness and solar system observations. Furthermore, we use the inferred correlation, by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, between the size of the bright ring (which is directly observable) and the size of the central brightness depression (which is not) of M87 and Sgr A$^*$ central supermassive objects, to constrain the parameters of the leading-order JP and KZ solutions. Using ten samples of the Standard Unbound distribution previously employed in the literature to reproduce certain scenarios of General Relativistic HydroDynamical simulations, we produce images of four samples of JP and KZ geometries enhancing and diminishing the shadow's size, respectively. Via a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the features of the corresponding photon rings and, in particular, of their relative brightness, we argue that it should be possible to distinguish between such parametrized solutions and the Schwarzschild geometry via future upgrades of very long baseline interferometry. We furthermore consider images of some naked objects within these parametrizations, and also discuss the role of inclination in comparing images of different black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering on Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of gravitational to electromagnetic waves in the presence of background magnetic fields is known as the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, analogous to the Primakoff effect for axions. Rephrasing this conversion as a classical electrodynamics problem in the far-field regime of a magnetized region, we derive the angular distribution of the intensity and polarization of the emitted electromagnetic waves. We discuss the interplay of the internal structure of the magnetic field, the polarization of the gravitational wave and the scattering angle, demonstrating for example that a dipolar field can convert an unpolarized stochastic gravitational wave background into polarized electromagnetic emission, with peak emission intensity along the equator. We moreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary for a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in the magnetosphere of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with a Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter Fluid I. Background Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled to gravity at the fluid level. While typically subdominant compared to Standard Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that this interaction modifies the early-time Friedmann equations, driving a phase of accelerated expansion that can resolve the horizon and flatness problems without introducing additional fields. At even earlier times, the coupling to spatial curvature may give rise to a cosmological bounce, replacing the initial singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally coupled dark matter could offer a unified framework for addressing both the singularity and fine-tuning problems.</description>

Abstract: We study theories breaking diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance down to the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff), consisting of multiple scalar fields in a cosmological background. In particular, we focus on models involving a field dominated by its kinetic term and a field dominated by its potential, coupled to gravity through power-law functions of the metric determinant. The Diff symmetry breaking results in the individual energy-momentum tensors not being conserved, although the total conservation-law is satisfied. Consequently, an energy exchange takes place between the fields, acting as an effective interaction between them. With this in mind, we consider the covariantized approach to describe the theory in a Diff invariant way but with an additional field, and discuss the phenomenological consequences of these models when it comes to the study of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Spinfoam tunneling of quantum geometries in angle variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling processes offer a promising path for finding signatures of quantum gravity. While tunneling of geometry has long been recognized in the literature, few detailed analyses have been carried out. We investigate covariant Loop Quantum Gravity transitions in the holonomy representation, which naturally encodes the extrinsic curvature of boundary states. We study these amplitudes within the simple framework of the Ponzano-Regge spinfoam model for three-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity. Having identified the geometries that dominate the spinfoam path integral in the classically forbidden regime when it is formulated in terms of dihedral angles as boundary data, we argue that they correspond to tunneling processes. Finally, we characterize these non-classical geometries and show that their contributions to the spinfoam amplitude are exponentially suppressed in the semiclassical limit via analytic continuation of the discrete gravity action. This work sheds light on quantum black-to-white-hole transitions, in particular clarifying the origin of the exponential suppression of various quantum amplitudes.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole solution obtained by smearing the point sources with a Gaussian distribution. We show that while the form of the metric function and the physical properties derived from that remain valid, not all the components of Einstein equations are satisfied. We construct an improved energy-momentum tensor that consistently satisfies Einstein equations and show that it leads to a different prediction for the region where the strong energy condition is violated. For certain choice of parameters, our proposal predicts the violation of the energy condition outside the Cauchy horizon, which might be important for observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>A One-sided Witness for the Quantumness of Gravitational Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information concepts and quantum technologies have opened the prospect to probe quantum gravity in table-top experiments. Many proposals rely on witnessing entanglement generation as a means to probe whether gravity is a quantum channel. Here we formulate a different and conclusive indirect test of the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction. Our witness is based on the concept of verifiable quantum memory in the dynamics of a quantum system. This allows us to assess the quantumness of an interaction between two systems by local measurements on one subsystem only. Our approach enables the first one-sided verification of the quantum nature of gravity, and provides a quantum signature of the interaction that is not fully covered by existing proposals. Our results open novel ways to witnessing the quantum nature of gravity in table-top experiments and clarify how {decisive tests can be designed even with measurements on only the probe system</description>

      <title>Cosmological correlators in gravitationally-constrained de Sitter states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological correlators in de Sitter quantum gravity in the limit where $G_N \to 0$. This limit is distinct from a nongravitational QFT because the gravitational constraints still force states and observables to be de Sitter invariant. We first examine a class of perturbative correlators that, in gauge-fixed form, are represented by the expectation value of a product of elementary fields on the late-time boundary. We formulate Feynman rules for our computations and enumerate some necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that must be imposed on states and operators to avoid group-volume divergences. These correlators are conformally invariant in all allowed perturbative states but never coincide with QFT vacuum-expectation values. For instance, our sample computations yield interesting non-Gaussianities even when the underlying vacuum wavefunction is Gaussian. However, we show that, in the presence of a heavy background state, it is possible to construct a separate class of state-dependent relational observables whose values approximate QFT correlators in the vacuum. This illustrates a key contrast in quantum gravity -- between observables that are microscopically simple and observables whose expectation values in an appropriate background state lead to simple QFT-like correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.</description>

      <title>Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f&gt;0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: Rendering images of black holes by utilizing ray tracing techniques is a common methodology employed in many aspects of scientific and astrophysical visualizations. Similarly, general ray tracing techniques are widely used in areas related to computer graphics. In this work we describe the implementation of a parallel open-source program that can ray trace images in the presence of a black hole geometry. We do this by combining a couple of different techniques usually present in parallel scientific computing, such as, mathematical approximations, utilization of scientific libraries, shared-memory and distributed-memory parallelism.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in momentum space: restoring CPT invariance of $\kappa$-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positive and negative energy modes of a field theory in $\kappa$-Minkowski/$\kappa$-Poincar\'e noncommutative spacetime have very different symmetry properties. This can be understood geometrically by considering that they span two distinct sectors of a curved momentum space. It seems that because of this asymmetry, charge conjugation and Poincar\'e invariance are incompatible. However, the structure of momentum space suggests that time reversal could be deformed so that the overall CPT-invariance is restored. We test these features by calculating explicitly the whole set of Noether charges associated with continuous relativistic symmetries within the canonical formalism, and study their transformation properties under deformed discrete symmetries.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative effects in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories: A toy model for Planckian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative completion of two-point correlators in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs), and analyze their behavior at distance scales shorter than the fundamental length scale set by the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Building on the interpretation of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation as a coupling to two-dimensional quantum gravity with a unique built-in length scale, we advance the study of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs as a toy model for Planckian physics. As we probe shorter distances, trans-Planckian oscillations are followed by a super-Planckian regime in which correlations are typically suppressed by geometric randomness, in contrast to the power-law growth characteristic of CFTs. Moreover, their dependence on distance becomes exponentially weaker, suggesting that the underlying geometric structure has been largely erased -- a behavior broadly consistent with expectations for quantum spacetime in this regime.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Admixed Strange Stars: An Effective Single-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and physical properties of strange stars admixed with dark matter by modeling the total energy density as a weighted combination of quark matter and bosonic dark matter components regulated by a volume fraction. Both the components are assumed to be distributed throughout the star. The quark matter is described by a linear equation of state (EOS), whereas the bosonic dark matter follows an EOS with repulsive self-interactions. By combining these into a single effective EOS, we reduce the two-fluid system to an equivalent one-fluid model and numerically solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius (M-R) relationship of the hybrid configuration. We systematically analyze how the stellar structure is modified by varying dark matter fractions, the mass of the dark matter particle and the self-repulsion coupling strength. Our results reveal distinct modifications to the M-R profiles and apparent phase behavior of the quark matter suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights into the properties of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments. This model also provides a possible explanation for ultra-compact stars with small radii, such as XTE J1814-338, suggesting its potential nature as a hybrid star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key test for any quasi-local energy in general relativity is that it be nonnegative and satisfy a rigidity property; if it vanishes, the region enclosed is flat. We show that the Hawking energy, when evaluated on its natural area-constrained critical surfaces, henceforth called "Hawking surfaces", satisfies both properties under the dominant energy condition. In the time-symmetric case, where Hawking surfaces coincide with area-constrained Willmore surfaces, we extend positivity and rigidity to include electric charge, a nonzero cosmological constant, and higher dimensions. In the fully dynamical (non-time-symmetric) case, we establish the first nonnegativity and rigidity theorems for the Hawking energy in this general setting. These results confirm the Hawking energy consistency with basic physical principles and address several longstanding ambiguities and criticisms.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$\sigma$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider models where the dilaton, seen as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, plays the role of dark energy. We revisit Weinberg's theorem and show that quantum corrections induced by the graviton lead to the screening of the dilaton locally. We also discuss the time evolution of the equation of state and find that phantom crossing is a natural feature of these models. The time variation of the equation of state and its deviation from $-1$ is limited by screening locally and can only be relaxed when the dilaton is allowed to have a mass of the order of the Hubble rate cosmologically, thus going beyond single-field screened dark-energy models. This obstruction extends to all single-field screened models of the chameleon-type where the large mass of the scalar on cosmological scales leads to a negligible variation of the equation of state at low redshift.</description>

Abstract: The scope of this Ph.D thesis is to study the effects of the presence of a boundary from a Quantum Field Theoretical perspective, searching for new physics and explanations of observed phenomena. In particular, thanks to the formal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge modes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the bulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs with boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be associated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in order to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the prediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall systems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a physical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum Field Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have non-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining symmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the boundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which also appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a possible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton quasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the algebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never proved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter, elasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this Thesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar gauge structure. This new model better highlight the properties of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Global finite energy solutions of the Maxwell-scalar field system on the Einstein cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of global finite energy solutions of the Maxwell-scalar field system in Lorenz gauge on the Einstein cylinder. Our method is a combination of a conformal patching argument, the finite energy existence theorem in Lorenz gauge on Minkowski space of Selberg and Tesfahun, a careful localization of finite energy data, and null form estimates of Foschi-Klainerman type. Although we prove that the energy-carrying components of the solution maintain regularity, due to the incompleteness of the null structure in Lorenz gauge and the nature of our foliation-change arguments we find small losses of regularity in both the scalar field and the potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics in a rotating BTZ black hole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of the thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector outside a BTZ black hole, from a perspective of quantum thermodynamics. In the context of an open quantum system, we derive the complete dynamics of the detector, which encodes a complicated response to scalar background fields. Using various information theory tools, such as quantum relative entropy, quantum heat, coherence, quantum Fisher information, and quantum speed of evolution, we examined three quantum thermodynamic laws for the UDW detector, where the influences from BTZ angular momentum and Hawking radiation are investigated. In particular, based on information geometry theory, we find an intrinsic asymmetry in the detector's thermolization process as it undergoes Hawking radiation from the BTZ black hole. In particular, we find that the detector consistently heats faster than it cools, analogous to the quantum Mpemba effect for nonequilibrium systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spin of a black hole significantly influences the magnitude of the asymmetry, while preserving the dominance of heating over cooling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Quantum Corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become physical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase space formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter localizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts that these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any quantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum corner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and quantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum representations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do so for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined. We then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of $4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a semiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the semiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum informational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general states and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement entropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.</description>

      <title>Covariant path integrals for quantum fields back-reacting on classical space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce configuration space path integrals for quantum fields interacting with classical fields. We show that this can be done consistently by proving that the dynamics are completely positive directly, without resorting to master equation methods. These path integrals allow one to readily impose space-time symmetries, including Lorentz invariance or diffeomorphism invariance. They generalize and combine the Feynman-Vernon path integral of open quantum systems and the stochastic path integral of classical stochastic dynamics while respecting symmetry principles. We introduce a path integral formulation of general relativity where the space-time metric is treated classically. The theory is a candidate for a fundamental theory that reconciles general relativity with quantum mechanics. The theory is manifestly covariant, and may be inequivalent to the theory derived using master-equation methods. We prove that entanglement cannot be created via the classical field, reinforcing proposals to test the quantum nature of gravity via entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>Physical reinterpretation of heat capacity discontinuities for static black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generic characteristic of self-gravitating systems is that they have a negative heat capacity. An important example of this behavior is given by the Schwarzschild black hole. The case of charged and rotating black holes is even more interesting since a change of sign of the specific heat takes place through an infinite discontinuity. This has been usually associated with a black hole thermodynamic phase transition appearing at the points where the heat capacity diverges, the so-called Davies points. This aspect of black hole thermodynamics has been addressed from different perspectives, motivating different interpretations since its discovery in the 1970s. In this paper, a physical reinterpretation of the heat capacity is provided for spherically symmetric and static black holes. Our analysis is partially based on a reformulation of the black hole heat capacity using the Newman-Penrose formalism. The application to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole case reveals a clear physical interpretation of the Newman-Penrose scalars evaluated at the event horizon. This allows us to write the heat capacity as a balance of pressures defined at the horizon, in particular, a matter pressure (coming from the energy-momentum tensor) and a thermal pressure (coming from the holographic energy equipartition of the horizon). The Davies point is identified with the point where the Komar thermal energy density matches the matter pressure at the horizon. We also compare the black hole case with the case of self-gravitating objects and their corresponding thermal evolutions. We conclude that the heat capacity of black holes and self-gravitating systems can be understood qualitatively in similar terms.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Quadrupolar Nature of Gravitational Wave Background through Space-based Missions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consists of an incoherent collection of waves from both astrophysical and cosmological sources. To distinguish the SGWB from noise, it is essential to verify its quadrupolar nature, exemplified by the cross-correlations among pairs of pulsars within a pulsar timing array, commonly referred to as the Hellings-Downs curve. We study how this quadrupolar signature manifests in correlations between general GW detector pairs, characterized by their antenna responses. Focusing on space-based missions including laser interferometers (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) and atom interferometers (AEDGE/MAGIS), we demonstrate how orbital motion dynamically modulates detector correlations through time-dependent separations and relative orientation shifts. These modulations encode unique statistical features that serve as definitive markers of the SGWB's quadrupolar nature. Our findings identify optimal configurations for these missions, offer forecasts for the time needed to identify the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB, and are applicable to both space-space and space-terrestrial correlations.</description>

      <title>Connecting scattering, monodromy, and MST's renormalized angular momentum for the Teukolsky equation in Kerr spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Teukolsky equation describes perturbations of Kerr spacetime and is central to the study of rotating black holes and gravitational waves. In the frequency domain, the Teukolsky equation separates into radial and angular ordinary differential equations. Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi (MST) found semi-analytic solutions to the homogeneous radial Teukolsky equation in terms of series of analytic special functions. The MST expansions hinge on an auxiliary parameter known as the renormalized angular momentum $\nu$, which one must calculate to ensure the convergence of these series solutions. In this work, we present a method for calculating $\nu$ via monodromy eigenvalues, which capture the behavior of ordinary differential equations and their solutions in the complex domain near their singular points. We directly relate the monodromy data of the radial Teukolsky equation to the parameter $\nu$ and provide a numerical scheme for calculating $\nu$ based on monodromy. With this method we evaluate $\nu$ in different regions of parameter space and analyze the numerical stability of this approach. We also highlight how, through $\nu$, monodromy data are linked to scattering amplitudes for generic (linear) perturbations of Kerr spacetime.</description>

      <title>On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. Along with many other structures, these fluctuations would have also given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high-density matter blobs that developed due to these fluctuations. We study here such a collapse, which are seeded by a scalar field $\phi$ associated to a non-trivial potential function $V(\phi)$, minimally coupled to gravity. Such a continual collapse is presumed to form a black hole always and is named a primordial black hole (PBH). Examining the dynamics of such a collapse, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form, thus resulting in the visibility of the final singularity of collapse for faraway external observers. This treatment is within the classical limits dictated by Planck's constraints. The slow-roll parameters are analysed here to keep the relic abundance of the scalar field high enough so that the abundance of produced primordial naked singularities (PNaSs) falls within the range of resolution of possible observational probes.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the cosmological implications of $f(Q)$ gravity with the barotropic fluid satisfying the affine equation of state (EoS). We study the impact of affine EoS on the cosmic evolution in model and derive the functional form $f(Q)$ in this gravity. We show that the non-metricity scalar may describe the unified scenario in which the universe transits from the decelerated expansion into the accelerated expansion. The model parameters are constrained by the Bayesian analysis based on $\chi^{2}$ minimization technique with the observational data of the cosmic chronometer and supernovae type Ia. The cosmic dynamics based on constrained parameters describe the observable universe evolution. The present day values of the cosmological parameters along with the current age of the universe are compatible with the observations.</description>

Abstract: Accurate modelling of black hole binaries is critical to achieve the science goals of gravitational-wave detectors. Modelling such configurations relies strongly on calibration to numerical-relativity (NR) simulations. Binaries on quasi-circular orbits have been widely explored in NR, however, coverage of the broader 9-dimensional parameter space, including orbital eccentricity, remains sparse. This article develops a new procedure to control orbital eccentricity of binary black hole simulations that enables choosing initial data parameters with precise control over eccentricity and mean anomaly of the subsequent evolution, as well as the coalescence time. We then calculate several sequences of NR simulations that nearly uniformly cover the 2-dimensional eccentricity--mean anomaly space for equal mass, non-spinning binary black holes. We demonstrate that, for fixed eccentricity, many quantities related to the merger dynamics of binary black holes show an oscillatory dependence on mean anomaly. The amplitude of these oscillations scales nearly linearly with the eccentricity of the system. We find that for the eccentricities explored in this work, the magnitude of deviations in various quantities such as the merger amplitude and peak luminosity can approach $\sim5\%$ of their quasi-circular value. We use our findings to explain eccentric phenomena reported in other studies. We also show that methods for estimating the remnant mass employed in the effective-one-body approach exhibit similar deviations, roughly matching the amplitude of the oscillations we find in NR simulations. This work is an important step towards a complete description of eccentric binary black hole mergers, and demonstrates the importance of considering the entire 2-dimensional parameter subspace related to eccentricity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similar to particle accelerators, black holes also have the ability to accelerate particles, generating significant amounts of energy through particle collisions. In this study, we examine the horizon and spacetime structures of a rotating black hole within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity. Additionally, we extend the analysis to explore particle collisions and energy extraction near this black hole using the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. Our findings reveal that the mass and angular momentum of the colliding particles significantly influence the center of mass energy, more so than the parameters of the black hole itself. Furthermore, we apply the Banados-Silk-West mechanism to massless particles, particularly photons, while disregarding their intrinsic spin in plasma; an aspect that has not been previously explored. The Banados-Silk-West mechanism cannot be directly applied, as the refractive index condition only permits photon propagation, meaning that massive particles in vacuum cannot be included in this study. We derive the propagation conditions for photons and analyze photon collisions by treating them as massive particles in a dispersive medium. The impact of the plasma parameter on the extracted center of mass energy is also examined. Our results show that the plasma parameter has a relatively weak and unchanged effect on the center of mass energy across all cases, indicating that energy losses due to friction within the medium are a contributing factor.</description>

Abstract: Rotating black holes can amplify ultralight bosonic fields through superradiance, forming macroscopic clouds known as gravitational atoms. When the cloud forms around one of the components of a binary system, it can undergo a series of distinctive interactions, comprising both secular effects, such as dynamical friction or accretion, and resonant behaviour. These processes are expected to leave a distinctive signature on the gravitational waveform emitted by the binary, whose detectability we investigate in this paper. To do so, we implement a numerical code that integrates these effects, computed within a Newtonian approximation, for intermediate-to-high mass-ratio binaries on circular equatorial orbits. Realistic waveforms incorporating these environmental influences are generated and analyzed using the Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the detectability of bosonic clouds with current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories. Our results demonstrate the potential for gravitational wave astronomy to probe the existence and properties of ultralight bosons.</description>

      <title>Radiative properties of a nonsingular black hole: Hawking radiation and gray-body factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the radiative properties of a spherical and singularity-free black-hole geometry recently proposed in the literature. Contrary to the Schwarzschild spacetime, this geometry is geodesically complete and regular, and, instead of the singularity, it presents a minimal surface that connects a trapped (black-hole) with an antitrapped (white-hole) region. The geometry is characterized by two parameters: the Schwarzschild radius and another parameter that measures the area of the minimal surface. This parameter is related to certain corrections expected in the context of loop quantum gravity to the classical general-relativistic dynamics. We explicitly compute the spectrum of the Hawking radiation and the gray-body factor. Since the gravitational potential is shallower than in Schwarzschild, the emission spectrum turns out to be colder and purer (less gray). From this, we sketch the evaporation history of this geometry and conclude that, under certain assumptions, instead of completely evaporating, the black hole naturally leads to a remnant, which provides a possible resolution to the information-loss issue.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a black hole cluster in full general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evolve for the first time in full general relativity a small, collisional N-body black hole cluster of arbitrary total mass M. The bound cluster is initially compact (radius R/M~10), stable, and consists of 25 equal-mass, nonspinning black holes. The dynamical interactions of compact objects in N-body clusters is of great interest for the formation of black holes in the upper mass gap as well as intermediate and supermassive black holes. These are potential sources of gravitational waves that may be detected by both current and future observatories. Unlike previous N-body Newtonian and post-Newtonian simulations, no "subgrid physics" is required to handle collisions and mergers. We can therefore confirm in full general relativity several predictions from these simulations and analytic estimates: the runaway growth of a large black hole via repeated mergers; spindown of the central black hole with increasing captures; the ejection of a black hole with a large asymptotic velocity due to a several-body interaction; and a regime where mergers occur primarily via direct collisions on highly eccentric orbits instead of quasicircular inspirals. We extract the gravitational wave signal and find it has several distinct features associated with the compact cluster regime. Our results suggest the signal is sufficiently loud that next generation observatories would likely be able to detect similar events across most of the observable universe. This work is a preliminary proof-of-principle study that we hope will open up a new arena for numerical relativity and the study of N-body compact systems.</description>

      <title>Galactic double neutron stars as dual-line gravitational-wave sources: Prospects with LISA and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double neutron star (DNS) systems could serve as intriguing dual-line gravitational-wave (GW) sources, emitting both high- and low-frequency GWs, arising respectively from the asymmetric spinning bodies of individual neutron stars (NSs) and the binary orbital inspiral. Detecting such dual-line signals could provide novel perspectives on binary orbital geometry and NS internal physics. We expand upon previously calculated spinning NS waveforms by incorporating higher-order terms of NS structural parameters. A population simulation is performed for spinning NS components in DNS systems potentially detectable by the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on 4-year LISA observation of 35 resolvable DNS systems under an optimistic scenario, we estimate that 6 (22) spinning NS components could be detected by the next-generation ground-based GW detector, Cosmic Explorer, under log-uniform (uniform) sampling of NS structural parameters. For these dual-line sources, the median signal-to-noise ratio achievable with Cosmic Explorer is approximately 20--30. Through the dual-line GW detection strategy, the relative measurement accuracy of the NS moment of inertia is estimated to be $\sim 8\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous definition of quasinormal modes for the Kerr black hole. They are obtained as the discrete set of poles of the meromorphically continued cutoff resolvent. The construction combines the method of complex scaling near asymptotically flat infinity with microlocal methods near the black hole horizon. We study the distribution of quasinormal modes in both the high and low energy regimes. We establish the existence of a high energy spectral gap and exclude the accumulation of quasinormal modes at zero energy.</description>

      <title>LIGO Detector Characterization in the first half of the fourth Observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in gravitational-wave astronomy depends upon having sensitive detectors with good data quality. Since the end of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third Observing run in March 2020, detector-characterization efforts have lead to increased sensitivity of the detectors, swifter validation of gravitational-wave candidates and improved tools used for data-quality products. In this article, we discuss these efforts in detail and their impact on our ability to detect and study gravitational-waves. These include the multiple instrumental investigations that led to reduction in transient noise, along with the work to improve software tools used to examine the detectors data-quality. We end with a brief discussion on the role and requirements of detector characterization as the sensitivity of our detectors further improves in the future Observing runs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Low ell's on Large Scale Structure Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the reported lensing anomaly of the CMB by considering several phenomenological modifications of the lensing consistency parameter, $A_{\rm L}$. Considering Planck spectra alone, we find statisically significant evidence for scale dependence (`running') of $A_{\rm L}$. We then demonstrate that the anomaly is entirely driven by Planck's low multipoles, $\ell \leq 30$. When these data points are excluded a joint analysis with several other datasets clearly favors $\Lambda$CDM over the extended $\Lambda \rm CDM+A_L$ model.
  Not only that the lensing anomaly and low $\ell$ anomaly of the CMB go away in this case, but also the $S_8$ tension is ameliorated, and only the Hubble tension persists.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with POMPOCO: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>Can decaying vacuum solve the H_0 Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work we analyze two different models of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, also known as vacuum decay models or $\Lambda(t)$CDM models. In both models, when the $H_0$ parameter is constrained by the Planck distance priors, its value is compatible with a higher value of $H_0$, in agreement with SH0ES data, while simultaneously reducing the values of $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$. In both models, we find $H_0=73.1\pm0.86$ at 68\% c.l. by combining Planck+SH0ES data. We also find the decay parameter to be $\varepsilon=0.0197^{+0.0032}_{-0.0027}$ for one model and $\varepsilon=0.0203\pm0.0034$ for the other one. From these analyses, a noninteracting model is excluded at least at $6\sigma$ c.l.! This shows that these types of models are promising in solving or at least alleviating the $H_0$ tension problem. Our analysis also shows a preference for the decay of vacuum into dark matter, in agreement to thermodynamic analyses.</description>

      <title>Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The horizon of black hole is surrounded by the photon sphere and an outside observer cannot easily examine the geometry inside the photon sphere. In this note, we propose a way to investigate the region from dual conformal field theory by making use of AdS/CFT correspondence. We first construct gravastar geometry as an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime, where the region inside the photon sphere is replaced by a horizon-less geometry. It is known that bulk-cone singularities in the retarded Green function in dual conformal field theory can encode the bulk null geodesics. We then compute numerically the retarded Green function from the bulk theory and observe bulk-cone singularities corresponding to null geodesics traveling into the interior region. In this way, we show that it is possible to examine the region inside the photon sphere from bulk-cone singularities of dual conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit scale separation for compactifications of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. For cosmological solutions rolling down flux-generated potentials, we observe that scale separation is achieved as time flows, and is fairly generic. This is realized without the need of orientifolds nor corrections to the classical supergravity approximation. We then confront scale separation with the Covariant Entropy Bound (CEB) and the CKN bound. We show that a naive application of these bounds to vacua hints at the existence of at least two extra dimensions. For rolling solutions, we observe that the CEB is not always respected, but since these examples lack a cosmic horizon, the application of entropy bounds remains delicate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic study of the Starobinsky-Higgs inflation model in the presence of an additional cubic term of the Ricci scalar. We investigate, in particular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we show that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility with cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct observational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we discuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including the scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an independent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel type of soliton dubbed soft oscillons. In contrast with conventional oscillons the soft counterparts come in a continuum of unboundedly large sizes. They are peculiar also in that the oscillation frequency is set by their size and in their high harmonic content, that leads to a peculiar core structure and pulsating emission of radiation. Soft oscillons appear in a broad class of scalar field theories with plateau potentials and owe their existence to a simple confinement mechanism: a large field perturbation automatically acts as a cavity that traps massless modes. We study the classical evaporation rate, lifetime and stability under anisotropic deformations. Soft oscillons are longer lived in gapless models, where lifetimes can reach 100 times the initial radius or more.</description>

      <title>Universal Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker factor, that can also be repackaged as solutions of 4d models, i.e. as 4d consistent truncations. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universal cosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential. For an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature), these models generally possess many desirable features: parametric control of e-folds, late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials (i.e. in accordance with swampland bounds), small string-loop and $\alpha'$-corrections, scale separation and/or absence of decompactification.</description>

      <title>Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth radiation bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum cosmology and propose restricting to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric - that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved in time. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model highlights a bouncing behavior, which gives a straightforward quantum representation of global de Sitter space. We argue that the inevitable time dependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de Sitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch of radiation domination near the singularity. The problem is equivalent to an $s$-wave scattering off a central power-law potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. Such a potential admits bound states, so the system is stable and the wavepacket undergoes unitary scattering. The radiation bounce, as opposed to the no-boundary bounce, does not have a classical counterpart as the corresponding classical solutions are singular. During the radiation bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>

      <title>Observers seeing gravitational Hilbert spaces: abstract sources for an abstract path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral suggests a striking result: the Hilbert space of closed universes in each superselection sector, a so-called $\alpha$-sector, is one-dimensional. We develop an abstract formalism encapsulating recent proposals that modify the gravitational path integral in the presence of observers and allow larger Hilbert spaces to be associated with closed universes. Our formalism regards the gravitational path integral as a map from abstract objects called sources to complex numbers, and introduces additional objects called partial sources, which form sources when glued together. We apply this formalism to treat, on equal footing, universes with spatial boundaries, closed universes with prescribed observer worldlines, and closed universes containing observers entangled with external systems. In these contexts, the relevant gravitational Hilbert spaces contain states prepared by partial sources and can consequently have nontrivial $\alpha$-sectors supporting noncommuting operators. Within our general framework, the positivity of the gravitational inner product implies a bound on the Hilbert space trace of certain positive operators over each $\alpha$-sector. The trace of such operators, in turn, quantifies the effective size of this Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Neutrino pair annihilation driven jets from black-hole torus systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform axisymmetric general relativistic radiation-viscous hydrodynamics simulations of black hole (BH)-torus systems with full Boltzmann Monte-Carlo neutrino transport to investigate the role of neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation in launching relativistic outflows. Our models span a wide range of BH spins, torus masses, and viscosity parameters. We find that the pair annihilation leads to the formation of relativistic fireballs in most cases, except for those with low black-hole spin and high viscosity. The isotropic-equivalent energies of these outflows reach $\lesssim 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$ with durations $\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm s}$. While this is insufficient to explain the brightest short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), our results suggest that the pair annihilation may account for some low-luminosity sGRBs and GRB precursors. We also provide updated scaling relations for the pair annihilation energy deposition rate as a function of accretion rate, and discuss the sensitivity of outflow properties to numerical resolution and floor density.</description>

      <title>Classical-quantum systems breaking conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system violates angular momentum conservation despite the rotational symmetry of the underlying equations of motion.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole Airy Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instantons, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why a recent attempt to compute the quenched entropy using one-eigenvalue instantons is unreliable due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit.</description>

      <title>Gravity and the Higgs boson mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to usual calculations in quantum field theory, both in flat and curved spacetime, the mass $m^2$ of a scalar particle is quadratically sensitive to the ultimate scale of the theory, the UV physical cutoff $\Lambda$. In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure and to the way $\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational background. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda$. This is obtained without resorting to a supersymmetric embedding of the theory, nor to regularization schemes (as dimensional or zeta-function regularization) where power-like divergences are absent by construction. In view of the results of the present work, we finally speculate on the way the Minkowski limit should be approached.</description>
