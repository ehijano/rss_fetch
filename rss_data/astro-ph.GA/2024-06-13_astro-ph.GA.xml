      <title>Unveiling the (in)consistencies among the galaxy stellar mass function, star formation histories, satellite abundances and intracluster light from a semi-empirical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a hierarchical, dark matter-dominated Universe, stellar mass functions (SMFs), galaxy merger rates, star formation histories (SFHs), satellite abundances, and intracluster light, should all be intimately connected observables. However, the systematics affecting observations still prevent universal and uniform measurements of, for example, the SMF and the SFHs, inevitably preventing theoretical models to compare with multiple data sets robustly and simultaneously. We here present our holistic semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl) that converts via abundance matching dark matter merger trees into galaxy assembly histories, using different SMFs in input and predicting all other observables in output in a fully data-driven and self-consistent fashion with minimal assumptions. We find that: 1) weakly evolving or nearly constant SMFs below the knee ($M_\star \lesssim 10^{11} \, M_\odot$) are the best suited to generate star formation histories aligned with those inferred from MaNGA, SDSS, GAMA, and, more recently, JWST; 2) the evolution of satellites after infall only affects the satellite abundances and star formation histories of massive central galaxies but not their merger histories; 3) the resulting SFR-$M_\star$ relation is lower in normalization by a factor of $\sim 2$ with respect to observations, with a flattening at high masses more pronounced in the presence of mergers; 4) the latest data on intracluster light can be reproduced if mass loss from mergers is included in the models. Our findings are pivotal in acting as pathfinder to test the self-consistency of the high-quality data from, e.g., JWST and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of quasars at $z&gt;6.5$: public data release and composite spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations for a sample of $45$ quasars at $6.50 &lt; z \leq 7.64$ with absolute magnitudes at $1450$ {\AA} in the range $-28.82 \leq M_{1450} \leq -24.13$ and their composite spectrum. The median redshift and $M_{1450}$ of the quasars in the sample are $z_{\rm{median}}=6.71$ and $M_{1450,\rm{median}} \simeq -26.1$, respectively. The NIR spectra are taken with echelle spectrographs, complemented with additional data from optical long slit instruments, and then reduced consistently using the open-source Python-based spectroscopic data reduction pipeline PypeIt. The median value of the mean signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra in J, H, and K band (median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{\lambda} \rangle$) is: median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{J} \rangle=9.7$, median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{H} \rangle=10.3$, and median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{K} \rangle=11.7$; demonstrating the good data quality. This work presents the largest medium/moderate-resolution sample of quasars at $z&gt;6.5$ from ground-based instruments. Its homogeneity and reproducibility make it ideally suited for several scientific goals, i.e., the study of the quasar proximity zones and damping wings, the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the intergalactic medium's metal content, as well as other properties such as the distribution of SMBH masses and Eddington ratios. Our composite spectrum is compared to others at both high and low-$z$ from the literature, showing differences in the strengths of many emission lines, probably due to differences in luminosity among the samples, but a consistent continuum slope, which proves that the same spectral features are preserved in quasars at different redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Challenging the LyC-Ly$\alpha$ relation: strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters without LyC leakage at z $\sim$ 2.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escape fraction of LyC ionizing radiation $f_{LyC}^{esc}$ is crucial for understanding reionization, yet impossible to measure at z $\gtrsim$ 5.3. Recently, studies have focused on calibrating indirect indicators of $f_{LyC}^{esc}$ at z $\sim$ 0.3, finding that Ly$\alpha$ is closely linked to it. What is still unclear is whether the LyC - Ly$\alpha$ relation evolves with redshift, and if Ly$\alpha$ is truly applicable as an $f_{LyC}^{esc}$ indicator during the reionization epoch. In this study, we investigate seven $-21 \lesssim M_{UV} \lesssim -19$ gravitationally lensed galaxies from the BELLS GALLERY survey at z $\sim$ 2.3. Our targets have rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths ranging from 10 \r{A} to 100 \r{A} and low dust content ($-2.5 \lesssim \beta \lesssim -1.9$), both indicative of high LyC escape. Surprisingly, direct estimates of $f_{LyC}^{esc}$ using Hubble Space Telescope imaging with F275W and F225W reveal that our targets are not LyC emitters, with absolute $f_{LyC}^{esc}$ $\lesssim$ 6.5% at 3$\sigma$ significance (with two sources having absolute $f_{LyC}^{esc}$(3$\sigma$) $\lesssim$ 10% and $\lesssim$ 16%). The low $f_{LyC}^{esc}$, coupled with the high Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and equivalent width could potentially be attributed to the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen column density and dust content. Our results challenge previous studies based on local samples, suggesting that the extrapolation of z ~ 0 Ly$\alpha$-based LyC indirect estimators into the reionization epoch might not be correct.</description>

      <title>The fountain of the luminous infrared galaxy Zw049.057 as traced by its OH megamaser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High resolution (0."037-0."13 [10-35 pc]) e-MERLIN ($\lambda6-18$ cm) and (0."024 [6.5 pc]) ALMA ($\lambda 1.1$ mm) observations have been used to image OH (hydroxyl) and H$_2$CO (formaldehyde) megamaser emission, and HCN 3-&gt;2 emission towards the nuclear (&lt;100 pc) region of the luminous infrared galaxy Zw049.057. Zw049.057 hosts a compact obscured nucleus (CON), thus representing a class of galaxies that are often associated with inflow and outflow motions. Formaldehyde megamaser emission is detected towards the nuclear region, &lt;30 pc (&lt;0."1), and traces a structure along the disk major axis. OH megamaser (OHM) emission is detected along the minor axis of the disk, ~30 pc (0."1) from the nucleus, where it exhibits a velocity gradient with extrema of -20 km/s south-east (SE) of the disk and -110 km/s north-west (NW) of the disk. HCN 3-&gt;2 emission reveals extended emission, along the disk minor axis out to ~60 pc (0."2). Analysis of the minor axis HCN emission reveals high-velocity features, extending out to 600 km/s, redshifted on the SE side and blueshifted on the NW side. We propose that the high-velocity HCN emission traces a fast &gt;250 km/s and collimated outflow, that is enveloped by a wide-angle and slow ~50 km/s outflow that is traced by the OHM emission. Analysis of the outflow kinematics suggests that the slow wide-angle outflow will not reach escape velocity and instead will fall back to the galaxy disk, evolving as a so-called fountain flow, while the fast collimated outflow traced by HCN emission will likely escape the nuclear region. We suggest that the absence of OHM emission in the nuclear region is due to high densities there. Even though OHMs associated with outflows are an exception to conventional OHM emission, we expect them to be common in CON sources that host both OHM and H$_2$CO megamasers.</description>

      <title>The First Combined H$\alpha$ and Rest-UV Spectroscopic Probe of Galactic Outflows at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-phase structure of gas flows in galaxies. We study 80 galaxies during the epoch of peak star formation ($1.4\leq z\leq2.7$) using data from Keck/LRIS and VLT/KMOS. Our analysis provides a simultaneous probe of outflows using UV emission and absorption features and H$\alpha$ emission. With this unprecedented data set, we examine the properties of gas flows estimated from LRIS and KMOS in relation to other galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR), star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), stellar mass (M$_*$), and main sequence offset ($\Delta$MS). We find no strong correlations between outflow velocity measured from rest-UV lines and galaxy properties. However, we find that galaxies with detected outflows show higher averages in SFR, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, and $\Delta$MS than those lacking outflow detections, indicating a connection between outflow and galaxy properties. Furthermore, we find a lower average outflow velocity than previously reported, suggesting greater absorption at the systemic redshift of the galaxy. Finally, we detect outflows in 49% of our LRIS sample and 30% in the KMOS sample, and find no significant correlation between outflow detection and inclination. These results may indicate that outflows are not collimated and that H$\alpha$ outflows have a lower covering fraction than low-ionization interstellar absorption lines. Additionally, these tracers may be sensitive to different physical scales of outflow activity. A larger sample size with a wider dynamic range in galaxy properties is needed to further test this picture.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium States of Galactic Atmospheres I: The Flip Side of Mass Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for understanding the relationship between a galaxy and its circumgalactic medium (CGM). It focuses on how imbalances between heating and cooling cause either expansion or contraction of the CGM. It does this by tracking \textit{all} of the mass and energy associated with a halo's baryons, including their gravitational potential energy, even if feedback has pushed some of those baryons beyond the halo's virial radius. We show how a star-forming galaxy's equilibrium state can be algebraically derived within the context of this framework, and we analyze how the equilibrium star formation rate depends on supernova feedback. We consider the consequences of varying the mass loading parameter etaM = Mdot_wind / Mdot_* relating a galaxy's gas mass outflow rate (Mdot_wind) to its star formation rate (Mdot_*) and obtain results that challenge common assumptions. In particular, we find that equilibrium star formation rates in low-mass galaxies are generally insensitive to mass loading, and when mass loading does matter, increasing it actually results in \textit{more} star formation because more supernova energy is needed to resist atmospheric contraction.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium States of Galactic Atmospheres II: Interpretation and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of galaxy properties with halo mass suggests that feedback loops regulate star formation, but there is no consensus yet about how those feedback loops work. To help clarify discussions of galaxy-scale feedback, Paper I presented a very simple model for supernova feedback that it called the minimalist regulator model. This followup paper interprets that model and discusses its implications. The model itself is an accounting system that tracks all of the mass and energy associated with a halo's circumgalactic baryons--the central galaxy's atmosphere. Algebraic solutions for the equilibrium states of that model reveal that star formation in low-mass halos self-regulates primarily by expanding the atmospheres of those halos, ultimately resulting in stellar masses that are insensitive to the mass-loading properties of galactic winds. What matters most is the proportion of supernova energy that couples with circumgalactic gas. However, supernova feedback alone fails to expand galactic atmospheres in higher-mass halos. According to the minimalist regulator model, an atmospheric contraction crisis ensues, which may be what triggers strong black-hole feedback. The model also predicts that circumgalactic medium properties emerging from cosmological simulations should depend largely on the specific energy of the outflows they produce, and we interpret the qualitative properties of several numerical simulations in light of that prediction.</description>

      <title>Formation of Giant Clumps in High-$z$ Disc Galaxies by Compressive Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the formation of giant clumps in violently unstable gas-rich disc galaxies at cosmic noon. While these are commonly thought to originate from gravitational Toomre instability, cosmological simulations have indicated that clumps form even in regions where the Toomre $Q$ parameter is well above unity, which should be stable according to linear Toomre theory (Inoue et al., 2016). Examining one of these cosmological simulations, we find that it exhibits an excess in compressive modes of turbulence with converging motions. The energy in converging motions within proto-clump regions is $\sim 70\%$ of the total turbulent energy, compared to $\sim 17\%$ expected in equipartition. When averaged over the whole disc, $\sim 32\%$ of the turbulent energy is in converging motions, with a further $\sim 8\%$ in diverging motions. Thus, a total of $\sim 40\%$ of the turbulent energy is in compressive modes, with the rest in solenoidal modes, compared to the $(1/3)-(2/3)$ division expected in equipartition. By contrast, we find that in an isolated-disc simulation with similar properties, resembling high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, the energy in the different turbulence modes are in equipartition, both in proto-clump regions and over the whole disc. We conclude that the origin of the excessive converging motions in proto-clump regions is external to the disc, and propose several mechanisms that can induce them. This is an additional mechanism for clump formation, complementary to and possibly preceding gravitational instability.</description>

      <title>The destiny of NGC 6530: past and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the structures of open clusters is crucial for understanding stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. Based on Gaia DR3 data, we apply the hierarchical clustering algorithm to a young open cluster NGC 6530 and group its members into 5 substructures. By linear tracing with the kinematic information of their members, we find that: Sub 1 is the core of the cluster. It is expanding slowly. Sub 2 consists of less bound members, which began escaping from the core about 0.78 Myr ago. Sub 3 is associated with a young star forming region. It will merge with the core after 0.72 Myr; Sub 4, as an outskirt group, is also moving towards the core, but won't end up falling in. While Sub 5 is composed of less-bound members with field contamination. This work reveals the complex internal structure and evolutionary trends of the cluster NGC 6530. It also shows the potential of the hierarchical clustering algorithm in star cluster structure analysis.</description>

      <title>Implications for Galactic Electron Density Structure from Pulsar Sightlines Intersecting HII Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent radio surveys have revealed pulsars with dispersion and scattering delays induced by ionized gas that are larger than the rest of the observed pulsar population, in some cases with electron column densities (or dispersion measures; DMs) larger than the maximum predictions of Galactic electron density models. By cross-matching the observed pulsar population against HII region catalogs, we show that the majority of pulsars with $\rm DM &gt; 600$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and scattering delays $\tau(1\ {\rm GHz}) &gt; 10$ ms lie behind HII regions, and that HII region intersections may be relevant to as much as a third of the observed pulsar population. Accounting for HII regions resolves apparent discrepancies where Galactic electron density models place high-DM pulsars beyond the Galactic disk. By comparing emission measures (EMs) inferred from recombination line observations to pulsar DMs, we show that HII regions can contribute tens to hundreds of pc cm$^{-3}$ in electron column density along a pulsar LOS. We find that nearly all pulsars with significant excess (and deficit) scattering from the mean $\tau$-DM relation are spatially coincident with known discrete ionized gas structures, including HII regions. Accounting for HII regions is critical to the interpretation of radio dispersion and scattering measurements as electron density tracers, both in the Milky Way and in other galaxies.</description>

      <title>One-sided H alpha Excess before the First Pericentre Passage in Galaxy Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel insights into the interplay between tidal forces and star formation in interacting galaxies before their first pericentre passage. We investigate seven close pair galaxies devoid of visible tidal disturbances, such as tails, bridges, and shells. Using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data of extended Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (eCALIFA), we unveil a previously unreported phenomenon: H alhpa emission, a proxy for recent star formation, exhibits a significant enhancement in regions facing the companion galaxy, reaching up to 1.9 times higher flux compared to opposite directions. Notably, fainter companions within pairs display a more pronounced one-sided H alpha excess, exceeding the typical range observed in isolated galaxies with 2 sigma confidence level. Furthermore, the observed H alpha excess in fainter companion galaxies exhibits a heightened prominence at the outer galactic regions. These findings suggest that tidal forces generated before the first pericentre passage exert a stronger influence on fainter galaxies due to their shallower potential wells by their brighter companions. This unveils a more intricate interplay between gravitational interactions and star formation history within interacting galaxies than previously understood, highlighting the need further to explore the early stages of interaction in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A Measurement of CO(3-2) Line Emission from eBOSS Galaxies at $z\sim 0.5$ using Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is a novel observational technique in astrophysics that utilizes the integrated emission from multiple atomic and molecular transition lines from galaxies to probe the complex physics of galaxy formation and evolution, as well as the large-scale structure of the universe. Modeling multiple line luminosities of galaxies with varying masses or their host halo masses poses significant uncertainty due to the lack of observational data across a wide redshift range and the intricate nature of astrophysical processes, making them challenging to model analytically or in simulations. While future experiments aim to measure multiple line intensities up to $z\sim 8$ across a wide volume using tomographic methods, we leverage publicly available datasets from the CMB experiment Planck and the galaxy survey eBOSS to constrain the CO(3-2) emission from galaxies. We correlate galaxies from eBOSS data onto the full-sky CO(2-1) map produced by Planck and report the first measurement of the average CO(3-2) intensity, $I_{CO} = 45.7 \pm 14.2\, \mathrm{Jy/sr}$ at $z\sim 0.5$ with $3.2\sigma$ confidence. Our findings demonstrate that stacking methods are already viable with existing observations from CMB experiments and galaxy surveys, and are complementary to traditional LIM experiments.</description>

      <title>The Size-luminosity Relation of the AGN Torus Determined from the Comparison between Optical and Mid-infrared Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optical variability of low-redshift ($0.15&lt; z\leq0.4$) active galactic nuclei using the multi-epoch data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that a damped random walk model well describes the ensemble structure function in the $g$ band. Consistent with previous studies, more luminous active galactic nuclei tend to have a steeper structure function at a timescale less than the break timescale and smaller variability amplitude. By comparing the structure functions in the optical with the mid-infrared obtained from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we derive the size of the dusty torus using a toy model for the geometry of the torus. The size of the torus positively correlates with the luminosity of the active nucleus, following a relation that agrees well with previous studies based on reverberation mapping. This result demonstrates that the structure function method can be used as a powerful and highly efficient tool to examine the size of the torus.</description>

      <title>The resolved star formation law in NGC 7469 from JWST, ALMA and VLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation process within the central 3.3 kpc region of the nearby luminous infrared Seyfert NGC 7469, probing scales ranging from 88 to 330 pc. We combine JWST/MIRI imaging with the F770W filter, with CO(2-1) and the underlying 1.3 mm dust continuum data from ALMA, along with VLA radio continuum observations at 22 GHz. NGC 7469 hosts a starburst ring which dominates the overall star formation activity. We estimate a global star formation rate SFR $\sim 11.5$ $\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ from the radio at 22 GHz, and a cold molecular gas mass M(H2) $\sim$ 6.4 $\times$ $\rm 10^9 M_{\odot}$ from the CO(2-1) emission. We find that the 1.3 mm map shows a morphology remarkably similar to those traced by the 22 GHz and the 7.7 $\rm \mu m$ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission observed with JWST. The three tracers reproduce the morphology of the starburst ring with good agreement. We further investigate the correlations between the PAHs, the star formation rate and the cold molecular gas. We find a stronger correlation of the PAHs with the star formation than with the CO, with steeper correlations within the starburst ring ($n &gt; 2$) than in the outer region ($n &lt; 1$). We derive the correlation between the star formation rate and the cold molecular gas mass surface densities, the Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation law. Comparisons with other galaxy populations, including starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei, highlighted that NGC 7469 exhibits an intermediate behavior to the Kennicutt-Schmidt relations found for these galaxy populations.</description>

      <title>Probing the filamentary nature of star formation in the California giant molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that filamentary structures are representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds and support a filament paradigm for star formation, potentially accounting for the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Using Herschel imaging observations of the California giant molecular cloud, we aim to further investigate the filament paradigm for low- to intermediate-mass star formation and to better understand the exact role of filaments in the origin of stellar masses. Using the multiscale, multiwavelength extraction method getsf, we identify starless cores, protostars, and filaments in the Herschel data set and separate these components from the background cloud contribution to determine accurate core and filament properties. Both the prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the distribution of filament masses per unit length or filament line mass function (FLMF) are consistent with power-law distributions at the high-mass end, $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log}M\propto M^{-1.4 \pm 0.2}$ at $M &gt; 1\,M_\odot$ for the CMF and $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log} {M}_{\rm line} \propto {M}_{\rm line}^{-1.5\pm0.2}$ for the FLMF at $M_{\rm line} &gt; 10\,M_\odot {\rm pc^{-1}}$, which are both consistent with the Salpeter power-law IMF. Based on these results, we propose a revised model for the origin of the CMF in filaments, whereby the global prestellar CMF in a molecular cloud arises from the integration of the CMFs generated by individual thermally supercritical filaments within the cloud. Our findings support the existence a tight connection between the FLMF and the CMF/IMF and suggests that filamentary structures represent a critical evolutionary step in establishing a Salpeter-like mass function.</description>

      <title>MOCCA: Global properties of tidally filling and underfilling globular star clusters with multiple stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of various properties of multiple-population globular clusters (GCs) for a broad range of initial conditions. We simulated over 200 GC models using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code and find that present-day properties (core and half-light radii, ratio of the number of second-generation (SG) stars to the total number of stars, NSG/NTOT) of these models cover the observed values of these quantities for Milky Way GCs. Starting with a relatively small value of the SG fraction (NSG/NTOT ~ 0.25) and a SG system concentrated in the inner regions of the cluster, we find, in agreement with previous studies, that systems in which the first-generation (FG) is initially tidally filling or slightly tidally underfilling best reproduce the observed ratios of NSG/NTOT and have values of the core and half-light radii typical of those of many Galactic globular clusters. Models in which the FG is initially tidally underfilling retain values of NSG/NTOT close to their initial values. These simulations expand previous investigations and serve to further constrain the viable range of initial parameters and better understand their influence on present-day GC properties. The results of this investigation also provide the basis for our future survey aimed at building specific models to reproduce the observed trends (or lack thereof) between the properties of multiple stellar populations and other clusters properties.</description>

      <title>Dark matter in the Milky Way: Measurements up to 3 kpc from the Galactic plane above Sun's location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are probing the gravitational force perpendicular to the Galactic plane at the position of the Sun with a sample of red giants whose measurements are taken from the DR3-Gaia catalogue. Measurements far out of the Galactic plane up to 3.5 kpc allow us to determine directly the total mass density where dark matter is dominant, while stellar and gas densities are very low. In a complementary way, we are also using a new determination of the local baryonic mass density to help us determine the density of dark matter in the Galactic plane at the solar position. We obtain for the local mass density of dark matter $\rho_\mathrm{dm}$=0.0128$\pm $0.0008 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$ = 0.486 $\pm$0.030 Gev cm$^{-3}$, for the flattening of the gravitational potential of the dark halo $q_\mathrm{\phi,h}$=0.843$\pm0.035$, and for its density $q_\mathrm{\rho,h}$=0.781$\pm$0.055.</description>

      <title>Why does the Milky Way have a metallicity floor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of light element enhancement in the most metal-poor stars is potentially an indication that the Milky Way has a metallicity floor for star formation around $\sim$10$^{-3.5}$ Z$_{\odot}$. We propose that this metallicity floor has its origins in metal-enriched star formation in the minihalos present during the Galaxy's initial formation. To arrive at this conclusion, we analyze a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation that follows the concurrent evolution of multiple Population III star-forming minihalos. The main driver for the central gas within minihalos is the steady increase in hydrostatic pressure as the halos grow. We incorporate this insight into a hybrid one-zone model that switches between pressure-confined and modified free-fall modes to evolve the gas density with time according to the ratio of the free-fall and sound-crossing timescales. This model is able to accurately reproduce the density and chemo-thermal evolution of the gas in each of the simulated minihalos up to the point of runaway collapse. We then use this model to investigate how the gas responds to the absence of H$_{2}$. Without metals, the central gas becomes increasingly stable against collapse as it grows to the atomic cooling limit. When metals are present in the halo at a level of $\sim$10$^{-3.7}$ Z$_{\odot}$, however, the gas is able to achieve gravitational instability while still in the minihalo regime. Thus, we conclude that the Galaxy's metallicity floor is set by the balance within minihalos of gas-phase metal cooling and the radiation background associated with its early formation environment.</description>

      <title>The morphology and kinematics of the galaxy group AM 1054-325: A MUSE perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy interactions in groups can lead to intense starbursts and the activation of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The stripped gas from the outer disk can lead to star-forming clumps along the tidal tails or sometimes tidal dwarf galaxies. We investigate the impact of interaction on various galaxy properties, including morphology, star formation rates, and chemical composition in the galaxy group AM\,1054-325 using Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data. We conduct a comprehensive spatially and spectrally resolved investigation of the star formation rate, star formation histories, metallicity, and AGN activity. The galaxy subgroup AM\,1054-325A shows multiple star-forming clumps in H$\alpha$ emission along the western tidal tail, which are formed due to tidal stripping. These clumps also have higher metallicities. AM\,1054-325B is quenched and shows disturbed gas kinematics and the signature of gas accretion in the H$\alpha$ map. The specific star formation along the tidal tail is higher, contributing to the galaxy's overall stellar mass growth.</description>

      <title>Rotational spectroscopy of CH$_3$OD with a reanalysis of CH$_3$OD toward IRAS 16293$-$2422</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have started a measurement campaign of numerous methanol isotopologs in low-lying torsional states in order to provide extensive line lists for radio astronomical observations from an adequate spectroscopic model and to investigate how the intricate vibration-torsion-rotation interactions manifest themselves in the spectra of different isotopic species. After CD$_3$OH and CD$_3$OD, we turn our focus to CH$_3$OD, which is an important species for studying deuteration in prestellar cores and envelopes that enshroud protostars. Notably, deuteration is frequently viewed as a diagnostic tool for star formation. The measurements used in this study were obtained in two spectroscopic laboratories and cover large fractions of the 34 GHz--1.35 THz range. As done in previous studies, we employed a torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model for our analysis that is based on the rho-axis method. The resulting model describes the ground and first excited torsional states of CH$_3$OD well up to quantum numbers $J \leqslant 51$ and $K_a \leqslant 18$. We derived a line list for radio astronomical observations from this model that is accurate up to at least 1.35~THz and should be sufficient for all types of radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog in these two lowest torsional states. This line list was applied to a reinvestigation of CH$_3$OD in data from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293--2422 obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The new accurately determined value for the column density of CH$_3$OD implies that the deuteration in methanol differs in its two functional groups by a factor of $\sim$7.5.</description>

      <title>Low-mass stellar and substellar content of the young cluster Berkeley 59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the young star cluster Berkeley 59 (Be 59) based on the $Gaia$ data and deep infrared (IR) observations with the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and $Spitzer$ space telescope. The mean proper motion of the cluster is found to be $\mu$$_\alpha$cos$\delta$ $\sim$ -0.63 mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu$$_\delta$ $\sim$ -1.83 mas yr$^{-1}$ and the kinematic distance of the cluster, $\sim$ 1 kpc, is in agreement with previous photometric studies. Present data is the deepest available near-IR observations for the cluster so far and reached below 0.03 M$_\odot$. The mass function of the cluster region is calculated using the statistically cleaned color-magnitude diagram and is similar to the Salpeter value for the member stars above 0.4 M$_\odot$. In contrast, the slope becomes shallower ($\Gamma$ $\sim$ 0.01 $\pm$ 0.18) in the mass range 0.04 - 0.4 M$_\odot$, comparable to other nearby clusters. The spatial distribution of young brown dwarfs (BDs) and stellar candidates shows a non-homogeneous distribution. This suggests that the radiation feedback from massive stars may be a prominent factor contributing to the BD population in the cluster Be 59. We also estimated the star-to-BD ratio for the cluster, which is found to be $\sim$ 3.6. The Kolomogorov-Smirnov test shows that stellar and BD populations significantly differ, and stellar candidates are near the cluster center compared to the BDs, suggesting mass segregation in the cluster toward the substellar mass regime.</description>

      <title>HI Imaging of a Blueberry Galaxy Suggests a Merger Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blueberry galaxies (BBs) are fainter, less massive, and lower redshift counterparts of the Green pea galaxies. They are thought to be the nearest analogues of the high redshift Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emitters. We report the interferometric imaging of HI 21 cm emission from a Blueberry galaxy, J1509+3731, at redshift, z = 0.03259, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We find that this Blueberry galaxy has an HI mass of $M_{\text{HI}} \approx 3\times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$ and an HI-to-stellar mass ratio $M_{\text{HI}}/M_* \approx$ 2.4. Using SFR estimates from the H$\beta$ emission line, we find that it has a short HI depletion time scale of $\approx 0.2$ Gyr, which indicates a significantly higher star-formation efficiency compared to typical star-forming galaxies at the present epoch. Interestingly, we find an offset of $\approx 2$ kpc between the peak of the HI 21 cm emission and the optical centre which suggests a merger event in the past. Our study highlights the important role of mergers in triggering the starburst in BBs and their role in the possible leakage of Lyman-$\alpha$ and Lyman-continuum photons which is consistent with the previous studies on BB galaxies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new N-emitter in the epoch of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a compact star-forming galaxy at $z=9.380$ in the GOODS-North field (named GN-z9p4) which shows numerous strong UV-optical emission lines and a single UV line, NIV] 1486. This makes GN-z9p4 the third-highest redshift N-emitter known to date. We determine the nebular abundances of H, C, N, O and Ne, size, and other physical properties of this object, and compare them to those of the other N-emitters known so far and to other star-forming galaxies. Using the direct method we find a metallicity 12+log(O/H)$=7.37 \pm 0.15$, one of the lowest among the N-emitters. The N/O abundance ratio is highly super-solar, and C/O and Ne/O normal compared to other galaxies at low metallicity. We show that the compactness of GN-z9p4 (with effective radius $118\pm16$ pc at 2 micron) and other N-emitters translates into very high stellar mass and SFR surface densities, which could be a criterium to identify other N-emitters. Future studies and larger samples are needed to understand these recently discovered, rare, and enigmatic objects.</description>

      <title>Detection of Open Cluster Members Inside and Beyond Tidal Radius by Machine Learning Methods Based on Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced a method that combines two unsupervised algorithms: DBSCAN and GMM. We applied this method to 12 open clusters based on Gaia EDR3 data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying reliable cluster members within the tidal radius. However, for studying cluster morphology, we need a method capable of detecting members both inside and outside the tidal radius. By incorporating a supervised algorithm into our approach, we successfully identified members beyond the tidal radius. In our current work, we initially applied DBSCAN and GMM to identify reliable members of cluster stars. Subsequently, we trained the Random Forest algorithm using DBSCAN and GMM-selected data. Leveraging the random forest, we can identify cluster members outside the tidal radius and observe cluster morphology across a wide field of view. Our method was then applied to 15 open clusters based on Gaia DR3, which exhibit a wide range of metallicity, distances, members, and ages. Additionally, we calculated the tidal radius for each of the 15 clusters using the King profile and detected stars both inside and outside this radius. Finally, we investigated mass segregation and luminosity distribution within the clusters. Overall, our approach significantly improved the estimation of the tidal radius and detection of mass segregation compared to previous work. We found that in Collinder 463, low-mass stars do not segregate in comparison to high-mass and middle-mass stars. Additionally, we detected a peak of luminosity in the clusters, some of which were located far from the center, beyond the tidal radius.</description>

      <title>Constraining Wind-Driven Accretion Onto Gaia BH3 With Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the most massive known stellar-origin black hole, with a mass $M_\bullet \approx 33 M_\odot$. Detected from Gaia's astrometry, this black hole resembles those observed via gravitational waves, whose nature is still highly debated. Hosted in a binary system with a companion giant star that is too far away for Roche-lobe mass transfer, this black hole could nonetheless accrete at low levels due to wind-driven mass-loss from its companion star, thus accreting in advection-dominated accretion flow, or ADAF, mode. Using stellar models, we constrain its Eddington ratio in the range $10^{-9} &lt; f_{\rm Edd} &lt; 10^{-7}$, corresponding to radiative efficiencies $5\times10^{-5} &lt; \epsilon &lt; 10^{-3}$, compatible with radiatively inefficient accretion modes. Chandra ACIS-S observed this object and obtained the most sensitive upper bound of its [2-10] keV flux: $F_X &lt; 3.25 \times 10^{-15} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1} \, cm^{-2}$ at $90\%$ confidence level corresponding to $L_{[2-10]}&lt; 2.10 \times 10^{29} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1}$. Using ADAF emission models, we constrained its accretion rate to $f_{\rm Edd}&lt; 4.91 \times 10^{-7}$ at the apastron, in agreement with our theoretical estimate. At the periastron, we expect fluxes $\sim 50$ times larger. Hence, accretion did not significantly contribute to black hole growth over the system's lifetime. Detecting the electromagnetic emission from Gaia BH3 will be fundamental to informing stellar wind and accretion disk models.</description>

      <title>A Census of Sun's Ancestors and their Contributions to the Solar System Chemical Composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we compute the rates and numbers of different types of stars and phenomena (SNe, novae, white dwarfs, merging neutron stars, black holes) that contributed to the chemical composition of the Solar System. Stars die and restore the newly formed elements into the interstellar gas. This process is called "chemical evolution". In particular, we analyse the death rates of stars of all masses, dying either quiescently or explosively. These rates and total star numbers are computed in the context of a revised version of the two-infall model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, which reproduces fairly well the observed abundance patterns of several chemical species, as well as the global solar metallicity. We compute also the total number of stars ever born and still alive as well as the number of stars born up to the formation of the Solar System and with a mass and metallicity like the Sun. This latter number will account for all the possible existing Solar Systems which can host life in the solar vicinity. Among all the stars (from 0.8 to 100 M$_{\odot}$) born and died from the beginning up to the Solar System formation epoch, which contributed to its chemical composition, 93.00$\%$ are represented by stars dying as single white dwarfs (without interacting significantly with a companion star) and originating in the mass range 0.8-8 M$_{\odot}$, while 5.24$\%$ are neutron stars and 0.73$\%$ are black holes, both originating from SNe core-collapse (M&gt;8 M$_{\odot}$); 0.64$\%$ are Type Ia SNe and 0.40$\%$ are nova systems, both originating from the same mass range as the white dwarfs. The number of stars similar to the Sun born from the beginning up to the Solar System formation, with metallicity in the range 12+log(Fe/H)= 7.50 $\pm$ 0.04 dex is 3.1732$\cdot$ 10$^{7}$, and in particular our Sun is the 2.6092$\cdot$ 10$^7$-th star of this kind, born in the solar vicinity.</description>

      <title>LOFAR Deep Fields: Probing the sub-mJy regime of polarized extragalactic sources in ELAIS-N1. I. The catalog</title>

Abstract: The aim of this study is to probe the sub-mJy polarized source population with LOFAR. We present the method used to stack LOFAR polarization datasets, the resulting catalog of polarized sources, and the derived polarized source counts. The ELAIS-N1 field was selected for a polarimetric study at 114.9-177.4 MHz. A total area of 25 deg2 was imaged at 6"- resolution in the Stokes Q and U parameters. Alignment of polarization angles was done both in frequency and in Faraday space before stacking datasets from 19 eight-hour-long epochs. A search for polarized sources was carried out in the final, stacked dataset, and the properties of the detected sources were examined. The depolarization level of sources known to be polarized at 1.4 GHz was quantified. A one-sigma noise level of 19 {\mu}Jy/beam was reached in the central part of the field after stacking. Twenty-five polarized sources were detected above 8\sigma, five of which had not been detected in polarization at any other radio frequencies before. Seven additional polarized components were found by lowering the threshold to 6\sigma at positions corresponding to sources known to be polarized at 1.4 GHz. In two radio galaxies, polarization was detected from both radio lobes, so the final number of associated radio continuum sources is 31. The detected sources are weakly polarized, with a median degree of polarization of 1.75% for the sample of sources detected in polarized emission. The sources previously detected in polarization at 1.4 GHz are significantly depolarized at 150 MHz. The catalog is used to derive the polarized source counts at 150 MHz. This is the deepest and highest-resolution polarization study at 150 MHz to date.</description>

      <title>An Untargeted Search for Radio-Emitting Tidal Disruption Events in the VAST Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for tidal disruption events (TDEs) using radio data from the Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Historically, TDEs have been identified using observations at X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths. After discovery, a few dozen TDEs have been shown to have radio counterparts through follow-up observations. With systematic time-domain radio surveys becoming available, we can now identify new TDEs in the radio regime. A population of radio-discovered TDEs has the potential to provide several key insights including an independent constraint on their volumetric rate. We conducted a search to select variable radio sources with a single prominent radio flare and a position consistent within 2$\sigma$ of the nucleus of a known galaxy. While TDEs were the primary target of our search, sources identified in this search may also be consistent with active galactic nuclei exhibiting unusual flux density changes at the timescales probed, uncharacteristically bright supernovae, or a population of gamma-ray bursts. We identify a sample of 12 radio-bright candidate TDEs. The timescales and luminosities range from ~6 to 230 days and ~10$^{38}$ to 10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with models of radio emission from TDEs that launch relativistic jets. After calculating the detection efficiency of our search using a Monte Carlo simulation of TDEs, and assuming all 12 sources are jetted TDEs, we derive a volumetric rate for jetted TDEs of 0.80$^{+0.31}_{-0.23}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with previous empirically estimated rates.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{DiffLense}$: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Super-Resolution of Gravitational Lensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing data is frequently collected at low resolution due to instrumental limitations and observing conditions. Machine learning-based super-resolution techniques offer a method to enhance the resolution of these images, enabling more precise measurements of lensing effects and a better understanding of the matter distribution in the lensing system. This enhancement can significantly improve our knowledge of the distribution of mass within the lensing galaxy and its environment, as well as the properties of the background source being lensed. Traditional super-resolution techniques typically learn a mapping function from lower-resolution to higher-resolution samples. However, these methods are often constrained by their dependence on optimizing a fixed distance function, which can result in the loss of intricate details crucial for astrophysical analysis. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DiffLense}$, a novel super-resolution pipeline based on a conditional diffusion model specifically designed to enhance the resolution of gravitational lensing images obtained from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Our approach adopts a generative model, leveraging the detailed structural information present in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) counterparts. The diffusion model, trained to generate HST data, is conditioned on HSC data pre-processed with denoising techniques and thresholding to significantly reduce noise and background interference. This process leads to a more distinct and less overlapping conditional distribution during the model's training phase. We demonstrate that $\texttt{DiffLense}$ outperforms existing state-of-the-art single-image super-resolution techniques, particularly in retaining the fine details necessary for astrophysical analyses.</description>

Abstract: The classical Cepheids CE Cas A, CE Cas B, CF Cas, and CG Cas are likely members of the binary open cluster comprising NGC 7790 and Berkeley 58. The clusters are of comparable age and in close proximity, as deduced from differentially dereddened $UuB_PBVGR_P$ photometry, and Cepheid period-age relations. Gaia DR3 astrometric and spectroscopic solutions for the clusters are likewise consistent. Conversely, the seemingly adjacent open cluster NGC 7788 is substantially younger and less distant.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the diversity of modeling methods to probe systematic biases in strong lensing analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, the diversity of strong lens modeling methods has exploded, from being purely analytical to pixelated and non-parametric, or based on deep learning. We embrace this diversity by selecting different software packages and use them to blindly model independently simulated Hubble Space Telescope imaging data. To overcome the difficulties arising from using different codes and conventions, we use the COde-independent Organized LEns STandard (COOLEST) to store, compare and release all models in a self-consistent and human-readable manner. From an ensemble of six modeling methods, we study the recovery of the lens potential parameters and properties of the reconstructed source. In particular, we simulate and infer parameters of an elliptical power-law mass distribution with external shear for the lens while each modeling method reconstructs the source differently. We find that overall, both lens and source properties are recovered reasonably well, but systematic biases arise in all methods. Interestingly, we do not observe that a single method is significantly more accurate than others, and the amount of bias largely depends on the specific lens or source property of interest. By combining posterior distributions from individual methods using equal weights, the maximal systematic biases on lens model parameters inferred from individual models are reduced by a factor of 5.4 on average. We investigate a selection of modeling effects that partly explain the observed biases, such as the cuspy nature of the background source and the accuracy of the point spread function. This work introduces, for the first time, a generic framework to compare and ease the combination of models obtained from different codes and methods, which will be key to retain accuracy in future strong lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Collapsing molecular clouds with tracer particles: Part II, Collapse Histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to develop a complete theory of star formation, one essentially needs to know two things: what collapses, and how long it takes. This is the second paper in a series, where we query how long a parcel of gas takes to collapse and the process it undergoes. We embed pseudo-Lagrangian tracer particles in simulations of collapsing molecular clouds, identify the particles that end in dense knots, and then examine the collapse history of the gas. We find a nearly universal behavior of cruise-then-collapse, wherein a core stays at intermediate densities for a significant fraction of its life before finally collapsing. We identify time immediately before each core collapses, $t_{\rm{sing}}$, and examine how it transitions to high density. We find that the time to collapse is uniformly distributed between $0.25 t_{\rm{ff}}$ and the end of the simulation at $\sim 1 t_{\rm{ff}}$, and that the duration of collapse is universally short, $\Delta t \sim 0.1 t_{\rm{ff}}$, where $t_{\rm{ff}}$ is the free-fall time at the mean density. We describe the collapse in three stages; collection, hardening, and singularity. Collection sweeps low density gas into moderate density. Hardening brings kinetic and gravitational energies into quasi-equipartition. Singularity is the free-fall collapse, forming an envelope in rough energy balance and central over density in $\sim 0.1 t_{\rm{ff}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employed our recent model of the cosmic-ray (CR) halo to compute the Galactic spectra of stable and unstable secondary nuclei. In this model, confinement of the Galactic CRs is entirely determined by the self-generated Alfvenic turbulence whose spectrum is controlled by nonlinear Landau damping. We analyzed the physical parameters affecting propagation characteristics of CRs and estimated the best set of free parameters providing accurate description of available observational data. We also show that agreement with observations at lower energies may be further improved by taking into account the effect of ion-neutral damping that operates near the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>SPICE: the connection between cosmic reionisation and stellar feedback in the first galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SPICE, a new suite of RHD cosmological simulations targeting the epoch of reionisation. The goal of these simulations is to systematically probe a variety of stellar feedback models, including "bursty" and "smooth" forms of supernova energy injection, as well as poorly-explored scenarios such as hypernova explosions and radiation pressure. Subtle differences in the behaviour of supernova feedback drive profound differences in reionisation histories, with burstier forms of feedback causing earlier reionisation. We also find that some global galaxy properties, such as the dust-attenuated luminosity functions and star formation main sequence, remain degenerate between models. Stellar feedback and its strength determine the morphological mix of galaxies emerging by z = 5 and that the reionisation history is inextricably connected to intrinsic properties such as galaxy kinematics and morphology. While star-forming, massive disks are prevalent if supernova feedback is "smooth", "bursty" feedback preferentially generates dispersion-dominated systems. Different modes of feedback produce different strengths of outflows, altering the ISM/CGM in different ways, and in turn strongly affecting the escape of LyC photons. We establish a correlation between galaxy morphology and LyC escape fraction, revealing that dispersion-dominated systems have escape fractions 10-50 times higher than their rotation-dominated counterparts at all redshifts. Dispersion-dominated systems should thus preferentially generate large HII regions as compared to their rotation-dominated counterparts. Since dispersion-dominated systems are more prevalent if stellar feedback is more explosive, reionisation occurs earlier in our simulation with burstier feedback. Statistical samples of post-reionisation galaxy morphologies probed with JWST, ALMA and MUSE can constrain stellar feedback and models of cosmic reionisation.</description>

      <title>A New Constraint on the Relative Disorder of Magnetic Fields between Neutral ISM Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing Planck polarized dust emission maps at 353 GHz and new large-area maps of the neutral hydrogen (HI) cold neutral medium (CNM) fraction ($f_\mathrm{CNM}$), we investigate the relationship between dust polarization fraction ($p_{353}$) and $f_\mathrm{CNM}$ in the diffuse high latitude ($|b|&gt;30^{\circ}$) sky. We find that the correlation between $p_{353}$ and $f_\mathrm{CNM}$ is qualitatively distinct from the $p_{353}$-HI column density ($N_\mathrm{H\,I}$) relationship. At low column densities ($N_\mathrm{H\,I}&lt;4\times10^{20}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) where $p_{353}$ and $N_\mathrm{H\,I}$ are uncorrelated, there is a strong positive $p_{353}$-$f_\mathrm{CNM}$ correlation. We fit the $p_{353}$-$f_{\rm CNM}$ correlation with data-driven models to constrain the degree of magnetic field disorder between phases along the line-of-sight. We argue that an increased magnetic field disorder in the warm neutral medium (WNM) relative to the CNM best explains the positive $p_{353}$-$f_\mathrm{CNM}$ correlation in diffuse regions. Modeling the CNM-associated dust column as being maximally polarized, with a polarization fraction $p_{\rm CNM} \sim$ 0.2, we find that the best-fit mean polarization fraction in the WNM-associated dust column is 0.22$p_{\rm CNM}$. The model further suggests that a significant $f_{\rm CNM}$-correlated fraction of the non-CNM column (an additional ~18.4% of the HI mass on average) is also more magnetically ordered, and we speculate that the additional column is associated with the unstable medium (UNM). Our results constitute a new large-area constraint on the average relative disorder of magnetic fields between the neutral phases of the ISM, and are consistent with the physical picture of a more magnetically aligned CNM column forming out of a disordered WNM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of the high-redshift universe have uncovered a significant number of active galactic nuclei, implying that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) would have to have been formed at much earlier times than expected. Direct collapse of metal-free gas clouds to SMBHs after recombination could help explain the early formation of SMBHs, but this scenario is stymied by the fragmentation of the clouds due to efficient molecular hydrogen cooling. We show that a subdominant population of tiny, evaporating primordial black holes, with significant clustering in some gas clouds, can heat the gas sufficiently so that molecular hydrogen is not formed, and direct collapse to to black holes is possible even at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Bound star clusters observed in a lensed galaxy 460 Myr after the Big Bang</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Gems arc is among the brightest and highly magnified galaxies observed at redshift $z\sim10.2$. However, it is an intrinsically UV faint galaxy, in the range of those now thought to drive the reionization of the Universe. Hitherto the smallest features resolved in a galaxy at a comparable redshift are between a few hundreds and a few tens of parsecs. Here we report JWST observations of the Cosmic Gems. The light of the galaxy is resolved into five star clusters located in a region smaller than 70 parsec. They exhibit minimal dust attenuation and low metallicity, ages younger than 50 Myr and intrinsic masses of $\sim10^6$ M$_{\odot}$. Their lensing-corrected sizes are approximately 1 pc, resulting in stellar surface densities near $10^5$~M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$, three orders of magnitude higher than typical young star clusters in the local universe. Despite the uncertainties inherent to the lensing model, they are consistent with being gravitationally bound stellar systems, i.e., proto-globular clusters. We conclude that star cluster formation and feedback likely contributed to shape the properties of galaxies during the epoch of reionization. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Predictions for CO emission and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor in galaxy simulations with non-equilibrium chemistry</title>

Abstract: Our ability to trace the star-forming molecular gas is important to our understanding of the Universe. We can trace this gas using CO emission, converting the observed CO intensity into the H$_2$ gas mass of the region using the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (Xco). In this paper, we use simulations to study the conversion factor and the molecular gas within galaxies. We analysed a suite of simulations of isolated disc galaxies, ranging from dwarfs to Milky Way-mass galaxies, that were run using the FIRE-2 subgrid models coupled to the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry solver. We use the non-equilibrium abundances from the simulations, and we also compare to results using abundances assuming equilibrium, which we calculate from the simulation in post-processing. Our non-equilibrium simulations are able to reproduce the relation between CO and H$_2$ column densities, and the relation between Xco and metallicity, seen within observations of the Milky Way. We also compare to the xCOLD GASS survey, and find agreement with their data to our predicted CO luminosities at fixed star formation rate. We also find the multivariate function used by xCOLD GASS overpredicts the H$_2$ mass for our simulations, motivating us to suggest an alternative multivariate function of our fitting, though we caution that this fitting is uncertain due to the limited range of galaxy conditions covered by our simulations. We also find that the non-equilibrium chemistry has little effect on the conversion factor (&lt;5\%) for our high-mass galaxies, though still affects the H$_2$ mass and Lco by $\approx$25\%.</description>

      <title>Helium Reionization from Empirical Quasar Luminosity Functions before and after JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, models of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) rooted on large observational compilations have been produced that, unlike their predecessors, feature a smooth evolution with time. This bypasses the need to assume an ionizing emissivity evolution when simulating helium reionization with observations-based QLF, thus yielding more robust constraints. We combine one such QLF with a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and 3D multi-frequency radiative transfer. The simulated reionization history is consistently delayed in comparison to most other models in the literature. The predicted intergalactic medium temperature is larger than the observed one at $z \lesssim 3$. Through forward modeling of the He II Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, we show that our model produces an extended helium reionization and successfully matches the bulk of the observed effective optical depth distribution, although it over-ionizes the Universe at $z\lesssim2.8$ as the effect of small-scale Lyman Limit Systems not being resolved. We thoroughly characterize transmission regions and dark gaps in He II Lyman-$\alpha$ forest sightlines. We quantify their sensitivity to the helium reionization, opening a new avenue for further observational studies of this epoch. Finally, we explore the implications for helium reionization of the large number of active galactic nuclei revealed at $z\gtrsim5$ by JWST. We find that such modifications do not affect any observable at $z\leq4$, except in our most extreme model, indicating that the observed abundance of high-$z$ AGNs does not bear consequences for helium reionization.</description>

      <title>The rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal and confirmation of its detection toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B</title>

Abstract: 3-Hydroxypropenal (HOCHCHCHO) is the lower energy tautomer of malonaldehyde which displays a complex rotation-tunneling spectrum. It was detected tentatively toward the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293$-$2422 B with ALMA in the framework of the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS). Several transitions, however, had large residuals, preventing not only their detection, but also the excitation temperature of the species from being determined unambiguously. We want to extend the existing rotational line list of 3-hydroxypropenal to shed more light on the recent observational results and to facilitate additional radio astronomical searches for this molecule. We analyzed the rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal in the frequency regions between 150 and 330 GHz and between 400 and 660 GHz. Transitions were searched for in the PILS observations of IRAS 16293$-$2422. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models were carried out and compared to the observations to constrain the excitation temperature. Additional transitions were searched for in other ALMA archival data of the same source to confirm the presence of 3-hydroxypropenal. More than 11500 transitions were assigned in the course of our investigation with quantum numbers $2 \le J \le 100$, $K_a \le 59$, and $K_c \le 97$, resulting in a greatly improved set of spectroscopic parameters. The comparison between the LTE models and the observations yields an excitation temperature of 125 K with a column density $N = 1.0 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for this species. We identified seven additional lines of 3-hydroxypropenal that show a good agreement with the model in the ALMA archive data. The calculated rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal has sufficient accuracy for radio astronomical searches. The detection of 3-hydroxypropenal toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B is now secure.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Broad H{\alpha} and H{\beta} Active Galactic Nuclei in MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines (FWHM &gt; 1,000 km s$^{-1}$) are incredibly efficient tracers of the high-velocity clouds encircling Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). As a result, we search for these broad line AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) catalog. We identify 301 broad-line H$\alpha$ galaxies and 801 broad-line H$\beta$ galaxies in the catalog. In total, we detect 1,042 unique broad-line galaxies with luminosities between 10$^{37}$ - 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$; 60 feature both broad H$\alpha$ and broad H$\beta$ emission. We also determine that the broad line region radius ranges between 0.01 - 46 light days, with a median radius of 0.1 light days (0.02 pc) for our broad H$\beta$ sample. In addition, we find that both samples feature a higher fraction of galaxy mergers (44% for the broad H$\alpha$ sample and 43% for the broad H$\beta$ sample), compared to the full MaNGA galaxy sample (26%), which suggests that merger-driven fueling is strongly active in our sample.</description>

      <title>On the age distribution of Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the positive correlation between age and Galactocentric distance seen in Galactic Classical Cepheids, which at first sight is counter-intuitive in the context of inside-out galaxy formation. To explain it, we use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model and a simulation of star particles in the Galactic disc coupled with stellar evolutionary models. We then select Classical Cepheids from this simulation and test in qualitative terms which ingredients are necessary to find agreement with the observational data. We show that the observed age vs. Galactocentric radius distribution in the Milky Way is a direct consequence of the disc's negative radial metallicity gradient (and, depending on the set of stellar models used, a metallicity dependence of the instability strip). The interplay of the metallicity gradient and the metallicity dependence of the Cepheids' life-time in the instability strip results in a pronounced positive age-Galactocentric distance relation. This renders a reconstruction of the recent star-formation history based on Classical Cepheids unlikely. It also has important consequences on our interpretation of the observed scatter about the radial metallicity gradient measured with Galactic Classical Cepheids.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the Galactic Center Excess Morphology Against Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains an enduring mystery, with leading explanations being annihilating dark matter or an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars. Analyzing the morphology of the GCE provides critical clues to identify its exact origin. We investigate the robustness of the inferred GCE morphology against the effects of masking, an important step in the analysis where the gamma-ray emission from point sources and the galactic disk are excluded. Using different masks constructed from Fermi point source catalogs and a wavelet method, we find that the GCE morphology, particularly its ellipticity and cuspiness, is relatively independent of the choice of mask for energies above 2-3 GeV. The GCE morphology systematically favors an approximately spherical shape, as expected for dark matter annihilation. Compared to various stellar bulge profiles, a spherical dark matter annihilation profile better fits the data across different masks and galactic diffuse emission backgrounds, except for the stellar bulge profile from Coleman et al. (2020), which provides a similar fit to the data. Modeling the GCE with two components, one from dark matter annihilation and one tracing the Coleman Bulge, we find this two-component model outperforms any single component or combinations of dark matter annihilation and other stellar bulge profiles. Uncertainty remains about the exact fraction contributed by each component across different background models and masks. However, when the Coleman Bulge dominates, its corresponding spectrum lacks characteristics typically associated with millisecond pulsars, suggesting that it mostly models the emission from other sources instead of the GCE that is still present and spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>Investigation of [KSF2015] 1381-19L, a WC9-type star in the high extinction Galactic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a multi-wavelength study of the Wolf Rayet (WR) star: [KSF2015] 1381-19L, which is located in the solar metallicity region (Z=0.014) of the Milky Way Galaxy, strongly obscured by the interstellar dust. We perform a detailed characterization of the stellar atmosphere by fitting the spectral emission lines observed in the Optical and Near-InfraRed (NIR) bands, using CMFGEN. The best-fitted spectroscopic model indicates a highly luminous ($10^{5.89}L_{\odot}$) star with a larger radius ($15\,R_{\odot}$) and effective temperature, wind terminal velocity, and chemical composition similar to that of Galactic WC9-dusty (WC9d)-type stars. The atmospheric ionization structure shows coexisting ionization states of different elements, simultaneously affecting the opacity and thermal electron balance. Fitting of the spectral energy data (SED) reveals high interstellar optical extinction ($A_{V}=$ 8.87) while the IR extinction is found to be comparatively lower ($A_{K_{s}}=$ 0.98). We do not detect any excess emission at near-IR wavelengths due to dust. Upon comparison of our results with the GENEVA single star evolutionary models (Z=0.014), we identify the best possible progenitors ( a rotating star of $67\,M_{\odot}$ and a non-rotating star of $90\,M_{\odot}$).</description>
