      <title>Bootstrapping the Electronic Structure of Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last several decades have seen significant advances in the theoretical modeling of materials within the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, but many methods commonly applied to this problem struggle to capture strong electron correlation accurately. Recent widespread interest in quantum materials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum effects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical methods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a periodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The 2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with $N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly correlated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we significantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic materials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to conventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands, which, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into electron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel oxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture electronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails. This work represents a major step toward accurately describing the electronic structure of quantum materials using reduced density matrices rather than wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Excitonic and magnetic phases in doped WTe$_2$ monolayers: a Hartree-Fock approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport and local spectroscopy measurements have revealed that monolayers of tungsten ditelluride ($1T'$-WTe$_2$) display a quantum spin Hall effect and an excitonic gap at neutrality, besides becoming superconducting at low electron concentrations. With the aim of studying the competition among different broken-symmetry phases upon electron doping, we have performed extensive Hartree-Fock calculations as a function of electron density and Coulomb interaction strength. At charge neutrality, we reproduce the emergence of a spin density wave and a spin spiral state surrounding a quantum spin Hall insulator at intermediate interaction strengths. For stronger interactions, the spin spiral is disrupted by a state breaking both inversion and time-reversal symmetries (but not their product) before the system becomes a trivial band insulator. With electron doping the quantum spin Hall insulator evolves into an easy-plane ferromagnet due to a Stoner-like instability of the conduction band. This phase competes energetically with the spin spiral state. We discuss how our results may help to interpret past and future measurements.</description>

      <title>Metastable short-range charge order in superconducting CuxTiSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a vast array of materials, including cuprates, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and rare earth tritellurides, superconductivity is found in the vicinity of short-range charge density wave (CDW) order. The crossover from long-range to short-range charge order often occurs as quenched disorder is introduced, yet it is unclear how this disorder disrupts the CDW. Here, using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), we investigate the prototypical TMD superconductor CuxTiSe2 and show that disorder induces substantial CDW dynamics. We observed the CDW phase fluctuation on a timescale of minutes to hours above the nominal transition temperature while the order parameter amplitude remains finite. These long timescale fluctuations prevent the system from finding the global free energy minimum upon cooling and ultimately traps it in a short-range ordered metastable state. Our findings demonstrate how correlated disorder can give rise to a distinct mechanism of domain formation that may be advantageous to the emergence of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-tuned randomness in inhomogeneous altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Successive Antiferromagnetic Transition in the Frustrated Compound CeMgIn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the magnetic, transport, and thermal properties of the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type compound CeMgIn with Ce atoms forming a distorted kagome network. This compound exhibits successive antiferromagnetic transition at $T_\text{N1} =$ 2.1 K, $T_\text{N2} =$ 1.7 K, and possibly $T_\text{N3} =$ 1.3 K. The electrical resistivity exhibits a minimum at 11 K and a nonlogarithmic increase with decreasing temperature down to $T_\text{N2}$. We found that CeMgIn is the first ZrNiAl-type compound whose resistivity increase can be well explained by considering a model in which the electron-spin scattering is enhanced by the magnetic frustration and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction. These results suggest that CeMgIn is a notable compound whose physical properties are strongly affected by geometrical frustration. Since the Sommerfeld coefficient is 97 mJ/mol K$^2$, CeMgIn is classified as a moderate heavy-fermion compound.</description>

      <title>Exotic Doublon-Holon Pairing State in Photodoped Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a unique pairing state in photodoped Mott insulators on ladder geometries, characterized by quasi-long-ranged doublon-holon correlations, using the density matrix renormalization group method. This phase exhibits doublon-holon pairing correlations with opposite signs along the rung and chain directions, reminiscent of d-wave pairing in chemically doped ladder systems. By constructing the phase diagram, we reveal that the doublon-holon pairing state emerges between the spin-singlet phase and the charge-density-wave/$\eta$-pairing phase. Our study suggests that the interplay of charge, spin, and $\eta$-spin degrees of freedom can give rise to exotic quantum many-body states in photodoped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Chiral phonons in polar LiNbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticles describe collective excitations in many-body systems, and their symmetry classification is of fundamental importance because they govern physical processes on various timescales, e.g., excited states, transport phenomena, and phase transitions. Recent studies have revealed that quasiparticles can possess chirality and that this degree of freedom leads to various important phenomena. Among them, chiral phonons have recently attracted significant interest because of their intrinsic magnetism, which non-trivially bridges the spin system and the lattice. Here, we directly prove the presence of chiral phonons in a prototypical polar crystal LiNbO3. Our demonstration adds a polar crystal in the showcase of materials hosting chiral phonons and, furthermore, creates a substantial potential in chiral phononics because of its expected in-situ switchable phonon chirality and associated control of phonon angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Orbital Order and Disorder in Fluoro-Perovskites with $t_{2g}$ Electronic Degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed high-resolution, variable temperature powder diffraction study of the fluoro-perovskites NaFeF$_3$ and NaCoF$_3$ is performed to probe their orbital ordering transitions. Through analysis of the symmetry adapted macrostrains and atomic distortions, we show that NaFeF$_3$ undergoes a C-type orbital order transition associated with the $t_{2g}^4$ states of Fe$^{2+}$. Counter-intuitively, the phase transition leading to the orbital order appears second order-like, which contradicts the thermodynamic requirements for electronic and isosymmeric phase transitions, implying that there must be an associated hidden symmetry breaking. On the other hand, for NaCoF$_3$, consideration of the symmetry adapted strains allows us to confidently rule out the occurrence of any long-range orbital orders down to 4 K. Since NaCoF$_3$ is an insulator with quenched orbital angular momentum at this temperature, our findings point towards a novel kind of orbital disorder associated to the $t_{2g}^5$ electronic degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</description>

      <title>An optimal bound on long-range distillable entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.</description>

      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate in the context of dissipative state preparation how a system may asymptotically approach the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. Building on case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Treating the strength $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.</description>

      <title>Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the symmetry charge can be exchanged with the environment but remains conserved on average. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We validate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</description>

      <title>Composite Bosons Superposition Ansatz Approach to One-Dimensional Trapped Few-Fermion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cold atomic systems provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena, offering tunable interactions and diverse trapping geometries. In this study, we investigate a one-dimensional system of trapped fermionic atoms using the composite boson formalism, which describes pairs of opposite-spin fermions as cobosons (short for composite bosons). By constructing a superposition ansatz of coboson states, we solve the Schr\"odinger equation for two fermion pairs under both attractive and repulsive interactions. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the potential of the coboson formalism for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems, achieving results comparable to standard exact diagonalization techniques.</description>

      <title>Improved Strategies for Fermionic Quantum Simulation with Global Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present efficient quantum circuits for fermionic excitation operators tailored for ion trap quantum computers exhibiting the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gate. Such operators commonly arise in the study of static and dynamic properties in electronic structure problems using Unitary Coupled Cluster theory or Trotterized time evolution. We detail how the global MS interaction naturally suits the non-local structure of fermionic excitation operators under the Jordan-Wigner mapping and simultaneously provides optimal parallelism in their circuit decompositions. Compared to previous schemes on ion traps, our approach reduces the number of MS gates by factors of 2-, and 4, for single-, and double excitations, respectively. This improvement promises significant speedups and error reductions.</description>

      <title>Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Modeling and computing many-body electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene with mechanical relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and compute solutions of a many-body model of the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. We model mechanical relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. Minimizers of the resulting functional are then input into a tight-binding model of twisted bilayer graphene, from which a single-particle continuum moir\'e-scale (Bistritzer-MacDonald-like) model is systematically derived. We then project this model together with a Coulomb electron-electron interaction term into the single-particle model's flat moir\'e bands. We numerically compute Hartree-Fock ground states of this model, comparing the relative energies of competing many-body ground states.</description>

      <title>Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and \mbox{(de-)confinement}. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Higgsing Transitions from Topological Field Theory &amp; Non-Invertible Symmetry in Chern-Simons Matter Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible one-form symmetries are naturally realized in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. In this work, we consider the potential realization of such symmetries in (2+1)d conformal field theories, investigating whether gapless systems can exhibit similar symmetry structures. To that end, we discuss transitions between topological field theories in (2+1)d which are driven by the Higgs mechanism in Chern-Simons matter theories. Such transitions can be modeled mesoscopically by filling spacetime with a lattice-shaped domain wall network separating the two topological phases. Along the domain walls are coset conformal field theories describing gapless chiral modes trapped by a locally vanishing scalar mass. In this presentation, the one-form symmetries of the transition point can be deduced by using anyon condensation to track lines through the domain wall network. Using this framework, we discuss a variety of concrete examples of non-invertible one-form symmetry in fixed-point theories. For instance, $SU(k)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a scalar in the symmetric tensor representation produces a transition from an $SU(k)_{2}$ phase to an $SO(k)_{4}$ phase and has non-invertible one-form symmetry $PSU(2)_{-k}$ at the fixed point. We also discuss theories with $Spin(2N)$ and $E_{7}$ gauge groups manifesting other patterns of non-invertible one-form symmetry. In many of our examples, the non-invertible one-form symmetry is not a modular invariant TQFT on its own and thus is an intrinsic part of the fixed-point dynamics.</description>

      <title>FeGe as a building block for the kagome 1:1, 1:6:6, and 1:3:5 families: hidden d-orbital decoupling of flat band sectors, effective models and interaction Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic structure and interactions of kagome materials, such as the 1:1 (FeGe) and 1:6:6 (MgFe6Ge6) classes, are complicated and involve many orbitals and bands around the Fermi level. Current theoretical models treat the systems in an $s$-orbital kagome representation, unsuited and incorrect both quantitatively and qualitatively to the material realities. In this work, we lay the basis of a faithful framework of the electronic model for this large class of materials. We show that the complicated ``spaghetti" of electronic bands near the Fermi level can be decomposed into three groups of Fe d orbitals coupled to specific Ge orbitals via symmetry and chemical analysis. Such a decomposition allows for a clear analytical understanding (leading to different results than the simple s-orbital kagome models) of the flat bands in the system based on the S-matrix formalism of generalized bipartite lattices. Our three minimal Hamiltonians can reproduce the quasiflat bands, van Hove singularities, topology, and Dirac points close to the Fermi level, which we prove by extensive ab initio studies. We also obtain the interacting Hamiltonian for the d orbitals in FeGe using the constraint random phase approximation (cRPA) method, which faithfully describes the antiferromagnetic phase. We then use FeGe as a fundamental LEGO-like building block for a large family of 1:6:6 kagome materials, which can be obtained by doubling and perturbing the FeGe Hamiltonian. We apply the model to its kagome siblings FeSn and CoSn, and also MgFe6Ge6. We further extend the formalism developed for the 1:1 family to the 1:3:5 family AB3Z5 (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Cr, V, Ti; Z = Sb, Bi), demonstrating the broad applicability of the LEGO-like building block approach. Our work serves as the first complete framework for the study of the interacting phase diagram of kagome compounds.</description>

      <title>Crystal structure evolution induced by the Jahn-Teller effect in mixed-valence silver fluoride Ag$_3$F$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The silver fluoride Ag$_3$F$_5$ consists structurally of square-planar units formed by four fluoride ions coordinated to a central silver ion, which possesses a partially filled $d$-subshell and the formal valence of +5/3. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously published crystal structure of Ag$_3$F$_5$ is unstable due to the Jahn-Teller effect, arising from the presence of two energetically degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states sharing a single electron hole. Through a full structural relaxation within the DFT+U framework, we identified a new crystal structure for Ag$_3$F$_5$ with reduced symmetry and an energy gain of 151~meV per formula unit relative to the published structure. In this relaxed structure, magnetic chains are formed by silver ions with an electronic hole occupying the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. These results highlight the crucial role of electron correlation effects and related structural distortions in determining the properties of such materials.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phases in the half-filled Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model in one dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the ground-state properties of a one-dimensional model with two orbitals per site, where, in addition to atomic energies $\pm M$, intra- and inter-orbital hoppings, the intra-orbital Hubbard ($U$) and nearest-neighbor density-density ($V$) repulsions are included. Our results are primarily based on a Jastrow-Slater wave function and variational Monte Carlo methods, but also corroborated by density-matrix renormalization group calculations. In the non-interacting limit, when varying $M&gt;0$, a gapless point separates a trivial phase from a topological one. The inclusion of a finite Hubbard-$U$ repulsion does not give rise to any phase transition within the topological region, inducing a smooth crossover into a Haldane (spin gapped) insulator; notably, the string-order parameter, which characterizes the latter phase, is already finite in the non-interacting limit. Most importantly, at finite values of $U$, the transition between the trivial and topological states is not direct, since an emergent insulator, which shows evidence of sustaining gapless spin excitations, intrudes between them. A small $V$ interaction further stabilizes the intermediate insulator, while a sufficiently large value of this nearest-neighbor repulsion gives rise to two different charge-density wave insulators, one fully gapped and another still supporting gapless spin excitations. Our results demonstrate the richness of multi-orbital Hubbard models, in the presence of a topologically non-trivial band structure, and serve as a basis for future investigations on similar two-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>On the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4 and its frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.</description>

      <title>Condensations in higher categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.09566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a higher-categorical generalization of the "Karoubi envelope" construction from ordinary category theory, and prove that, like the ordinary Karoubi envelope, our higher Karoubi envelope is the closure for absolute limits. Our construction replaces the idempotents in the ordinary version with a notion that we call "condensations." The name is justified by the direct physical interpretation of the notion of condensation: it encodes a general class of constructions which produce a new topological phase of matter by turning on a commuting projector Hamiltonian on a lattice of defects within a different topological phase, which may be the trivial phase. We also identify our higher Karoubi envelopes with categories of fully-dualizable objects. Together with the Cobordism Hypothesis, we argue that this realizes an equivalence between a very broad class of gapped topological phases of matter and fully extended topological field theories, in any number of dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological Responses of the Standard Model Gauge Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Lie algebra of the Standard Model (SM) is $su(3)\times su(2) \times u(1)$, yet its global gauge group, $G_{{\rm SM}_{\rm q}}=$SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1)/$\mathbb{Z}_{\rm q}$, q$=1,2,3,6$ remains undetermined. Building on previous work on 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism invariants, we classify lower-dimensional invertible field theories (iFTs) or symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs) in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the integer SPTs are hard to detect, the fractional SPTs produce measurable topological responses. In particular, the symmetry fractionalization labeled by $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{6/{\rm q}}$ in [arXiv:2411.18160] introduces the symmetry-enriched SM variants, denoted as SM$_{({\rm q},k)}$. We further introduce a new integer $n$ series of baryon-minus-lepton $({\bf B}-{\bf L})$-like U(1) symmetries, $X_n \equiv n (\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{L}) + (1-\frac{n}{N_c})\tilde{Y}$ with electroweak hypercharge $\tilde{Y}$, $n\ge1$, $N_c=3$, where the charge $q_{X_n} = q_{\tilde{Y}} \mod n$. Analyzing the symmetry-enriched SM with 0-form and 1-form symmetries $(G_{[0]}, G_{[1]})$, symmetry-twist group homomorphism $\rho$, and symmetry frationalization obstruction $[\beta]$, their spacetime-internal gauge bundle constraints, and their mixed anomalies, we derive the fractional topological response $\sigma_n({\rm q},k)=\frac{{\rm q}(1-n)\gcd(2,n)}{2n}+\frac{k{\rm q}}{6}\mod1.$ Our $\sigma_n$ response requires more general Spin$^c$ manifolds for odd $n$ and Spin manifolds for even $n$. For a given $n$ (with $n\ge 7$ and $n\ne 10,12,15,30$), $\sigma_n$ uniquely fixes the gauge group parameter q and fractionalization label $k$. Moreover, using pairs such as $(n_1,n_2)=(2,3),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)$, etc. uniquely distinguishes SM$_{({\rm q},k)}$. Our results illuminate the global structure of the SM gauge group via measurable topological responses.</description>
