      <title>Habitability of exoplanets orbiting flaring stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of late 2025 there are about 70 exoplanets that meet the formal criterion of having equilibrium temperatures allowing the presence of liquid water and about 50 of them orbit M-stars, known for their strong chromospheric activity. Most of these stars are close to the Sun and the planet-to-star mass and luminosity ratios are advantageous, allowing for a more detailed follow-up than of planets orbiting hotter and more massive stars. Many more planets orbiting late-type stars are expected to be discovered by Gaia and PLATO in the following years. However, the lingering question remains whether the UV and X-ray emission, associated with the stellar activity, allows for complex life. A comprehensive study focused on properties of flaring exoplanet hosts and their activity, on a much larger scale than these few tens (soon to become hundreds) of stars with habitable planets is called for, to answer the question if such stars can harbor habitable planets. The proposed Wide Field Survey telescope is well suited for this study.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic counterparts of massive BH mergers with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), adopted by ESA and scheduled for the second half of the next decade, will drive a new revolution in the rapidly growing field of gravitational-wave astronomy, by extending GW observations into the hiterto unexplored millihertz regime. One of the key source classes of LISA is merging massive black hole binaries in the 1e4-1e7 Msun mass range detectable to very high redshifts $z\sim 15$. MBHBs lighter than 1e6 Msun can potentially be identified during their inspiral weeks before coalescence, allowing for complementary electromagnetic observations before, during, and after the two MBHs merge. This white paper aims at defining the optimal strategy to maximize the number of detected EM counterparts of LISA MBHB events.</description>

      <title>Detection of Lensed Gravitational Waves in the Millihertz Band Using Frequency-Domain Lensing Feature Extraction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe lensed GW events, offering new opportunities for cosmology and fundamental physics. In the millihertz frequency band, the GW wavelength is often comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of the lens, where wave-optics effects are significant. Although traditional matched filtering is effective, the intense computational resources required motivate the search for more efficient alternatives to accelerate candidate event screening. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a Dual-Channel Lensing feature extraction eXtended Long Short-Term Memory Network (DCL-xLSTM). Unlike conventional recurrent architectures, DCL-xLSTM employs a matrix-valued memory structure and a memory-mixing mechanism to effectively capture amplitude diffraction patterns that span the entire millihertz frequency band. Trained on data generated by Point Mass (PM) and Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) models accounting for the transition from wave-optics to geometric-optics, the proposed method achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.99, maintaining a true positive rate (TPR) above 98% at a false positive rate (FPR) below 1%. The network is robust against variations in signal-to-noise ratio, lens type, and lens mass, establishing its viability as a high-efficiency tool for future space-based GW detection.</description>

      <title>Neural Network for Simulating Radio Emission from Extensive Air Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray shower detection using large radio arrays has gained significant traction in recent years. With massive improvements in signal modelling and microscopic simulations, the analysis of incoming events is still severely limited by the simulation cost of radio emission to interpret the data. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used for simulating such radio pulses. This work serves as a proof of concept that simple neural networks can be used for emergent deterministic macroscopic phenomena of microscopic simulations. We also demonstrate how such a neural network can be used for the physics use case of $X_\mathrm{max}$ reconstruction, while retaining comparable resolution to using full Monte-Carlo simulations for radio emission.

      <title>WST spectroscopic variability alerts: discovery space, data flow system requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enormous multiplexity of the WST opens up the possibility to trigger alerts for variable objects - an option that has been reserved so far only for imaging surveys. WST can go further by detecting spectroscopic line profile and line strength variations. I review previous alert-issuing surveys that are limited to imaging, and describe some of the new research possibilities that this feature of the data flow system (DFS) would open up. The latter range from variability of emission line stars, such as Bes, WRs and LBVs to variability of active galaxies and quasars, including the so-called changing look objects that shift between Type 1 and Type 2. Furthermore, I describe the requirements that the WST DFS must meet to make this feasible. The most critical aspect is the rapid data processing for timely follow-up. Next, the alert system is tightly connected with the data reduction and archive, because it will need an extensive and continuously updated spectral reference database. The new spectra will have to be compared against these reference spectra to identify variations. The reference spectra can either be "native" from the WST itself or they can originate from other spectroscopic surveys. Two options for the DFS are considered: one is to conduct an automated search of the WST's own archive, and potentially of other spectroscopic archives and a second option is to allow the users to submit reference spectra on their own. The spectroscopic alert system will open up a completely new discovery space that is not accessible to the existing or planned near-future surveys. Finally, I discuss the advantages of moving the variability detection to physical parameters by modeling the observed and reference spectra and comparing the derived fitting parameters. This strategy offers a robust method for alert ranking.</description>

      <title>GraviBERT: Transformer-based inference for gravitational-wave time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GraviBERT, a novel deep learning framework for inference of gravitational-wave time series, which relies on an Inception-inspired multi-scale convolutional feature extractor combined with a transformer encoder and a suitable regression head. GraviBERT is trained in two stages: a BERT-style pretraining phase, in which the model learns to predict masked segments in feature space to capture universal patterns and physics, followed by supervised fine-tuning for accurate parameter estimation. This approach demonstrates impressive improvement across multiple metrics compared to training from scratch. On in-domain data, it reduces the mean absolute error for point-estimate parameter inference by up to $30\%$, and training convergence accelerates by up to a factor of six. Moreover, at low signal-to-noise ratio, the mean relative precision of the inferred masses and distances reaches the few-percent level, while the mean absolute error in the effective spin is about $10^{-3}$. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model demonstrates remarkable efficiency, converging up to $15\times$ faster on small target datasets and reducing estimation errors by up to approximately $45\%$, indicating that it learns sufficient detector-agnostic representations. Cross-approximant transfer demonstrates comparable performance, achieving up to $44\%$ reductions in mean absolute error across all parameters and up to $15\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding 0.9 for mass parameters at signal-to-noise ratio 10, compared to 0.74 - 0.87 when training from scratch. Notably, GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms. The final regression head of the model can be adapted for a range of downstream tasks after pretraining, positioning it as a step towards foundation-style models in gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Weak Lensing Surveys to Gravitational Waves from Inspiraling Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of upcoming and idealized weak lensing surveys to gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the nanohertz to microhertz frequency band. This range, situated between the reach of pulsar timing arrays and space-based interferometers, remains observationally underexplored. Building upon the formalism for GW-induced shear distortions, we develop a signal-to-noise framework that incorporates realistic survey characteristics, including cadence, angular resolution, and depth. We model the effective galaxy population using a redshift- and luminosity-dependent distribution to evaluate the noise power spectral density across the survey. Applying this framework to both LSST-like and idealized survey configurations, we derive characteristic strain sensitivity curves and identify the detectable parameter space for SMBHBs. We find that while current surveys are limited by angular resolution, an ideal full-sky survey with milliarcsecond-level precision and rapid cadence could detect continuous GW signals from SMBHBs at cosmological distances and partially bridge the PTA-LISA sensitivity gap. Our analysis highlights the potential and limitations of weak-lensing surveys for low-frequency GW astronomy, with angular resolution emerging as the dominant constraint.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves and its 3D topographic effect using the spectral-element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moon has been regarded as a natural Weber bar capable of amplifying gravitational waves (GWs) for detecting events across a wide range of frequencies. However, accurately determining the amplification effects remains challenging due to the absence of 3D numerical simulation methods. In this study, we develop a high-order 3D finite element method (spectral-element method, SEM) to numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs below 20 mHz. We verify the accuracy of our method by comparing the resonant peaks of our results with those from semi-analytical solutions and find that the frequency deviation is less than 3% for the first peak at about 1 mHz and less than 0.8% for the subsequent peaks up to 10 mHz. Using this method, we evaluate the amplification of GW signals due to 3D topographic effects of the Moon, and we find enhancements at a series of specific frequency components. These results highlight the non-negligible effect of surface topography on the lunar response to GWs, as a fundamental factor that holds significant implications across both global and regional analyses. Our work paves the way for a comprehensive evaluation of the Moon's resonant response to GWs, helpful for the strategic planning of lunar GW detections.</description>

      <title>Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals I: Statistics Based on Time-Frequency Signal Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mini-extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs), composed of a stellar-mass compact object and a much lighter companion, are promising sources of continuous gravitational waves in the frequency band of ground-based interferometers such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Such systems, consisting of sub-solar-mass compact objects, provide a unique probe of exotic compact objects, including primordial black holes. Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $\Sigma$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types. Our results provide a foundation for mini-EMRI searches and demonstrate the potential of current ground-based detectors to probe the existence of sub-solar-mass compact objects.</description>

      <title>Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals II: A Spectral-Leakage-Aware Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (mini-EMRIs), comprising a sub-solar exotic compact object (such as a primordial black hole or boson star) orbiting a much heavier stellar-origin or exotic compact object, represent key targets for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors to probe the early universe and the nature of dark matter. However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $\Sigma$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $\Sigma R$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\,M_\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This approach can be similarly applied to EMRI searches for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>TITAN DR1: An Improved, Validated, and Systematically-Controlled Recalibration of ATLAS Photometry toward Type Ia Supernova Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial Last Alert System) is a time-domain survey using four telescopes, covering the entire sky. It has observed over 10,000 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), with thousands of cosmology-grade light curves (to be released as TITAN DR1). To prepare this massive, low-redshift dataset for cosmology, we evaluate and cross-calibrate ATLAS forced photometry using tertiary stars from the DES (Dark Energy Survey) Y6 release. The 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint overlaps regions both in and out of the PS1 (Pan-STARRS DR1) footprint, allowing tests of the primary calibrator for the ATLAS Refcat2 catalog. Initial offsets are at the $\sim$40 mmag scale. To improve this we determine $\Delta$ zeropoint offsets for two cases: (1) pixel-to-pixel offsets within individual CCDs (reduced from $\sim$8 to $\sim$4 mmag RMS) and (2) chip-to-chip offsets across the 9 CCDs and filters (reduced from $\sim$17 to $\sim$3 mmag RMS). We also identify the largest systematic uncertainty as a transmission-function color dependence, requiring shifts in the assumed ATLAS filters at the $\sim$30 mmag level if uncorrected. We validate our calibration using (a) CALSPEC standards, (b) an independent tertiary catalog, and (c) distance moduli of cross-matched SNe~Ia, all showing improved consistency. Overall, we estimate combined calibration-related systematics at the $\sim$5--10 mmag level, supporting competitive cosmological constraints with the TITAN SN~Ia dataset.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray-Constrained LSTM Model for Geomagnetic Storm Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms (GSTs) driven by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling can severely disrupt technological systems, motivating the need for improved prediction accuracy and longer warning times. In this study, we develop a physics-informed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that incorporates cosmic-ray flux modulation as an additional precursor signal. As coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven disturbances propagate through the heliosphere, enhanced turbulence and magnetic-field compression reduce galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) flux measured by ground-based neutron monitors (Forbush decreases), providing early information that can precede near-Earth solar-wind signatures by 1--3 days. We integrate multi-source space-weather data, spanning 1995-2020, including cosmic-ray observations, solar wind plasma parameters, interplanetary magnetic-field data, and geomagnetic indices. Based on these data, we construct a 19-dimensional feature vector that includes flux background levels, decrease-related indicators, and inter-station correlation measures as model inputs. Employing a 50-unit LSTM architecture, the proposed model achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 5.106 nT, 8.315 nT, 10.854 nT, 12.883 nT, and 14.788 nT for 2-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-hour predictions, respectively. Incorporating cosmic-ray information further improves 48-hour forecast skill by up to 25.84% (from 0.178 to 0.224). These results demonstrate the value of physics-informed deep learning and cosmic-ray precursors for advancing space-weather forecasting.</description>

Abstract: The Earth's atmospheric turbulence degrades the precision of ground-based astrometry. Here, we discuss these limitations and propose that, with proper treatment of systematics and by leveraging the many epochs available from the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), seeing-limited observations can reach sub-milliarcsecond precision. Such observations may be instrumental for the detection of Galactic black holes via microlensing. We present our methodology and pipeline for precise astrometric measurements using seeing-limited observations. The method is a variant of Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) that includes several detrending steps. Tests on 6,500 images of the same field, obtained by KMTNet with typical seeing condition of 1 arcsecond and pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond, suggest that we can achieve, at the bright end (mag&lt;17), per-epoch relative astrometric precision of ~5 and relative proper motion precision of 0.1-0.2 mas/yr over a baseline of approximately five years, using data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) site. Time binning on 5--20 day cadences improves the bright-source precision to ~2 mas per coordinate on astrometric microlensing-relevant timescales. The precision is estimated using bootstrap simulations and further validated by comparing results from two independent KMTNet telescopes.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Link Budget Analysis for Low Earth Orbit Satellites in the Optical Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing valuable insights for system designers and operators.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Controlled Beam Pattern Measurement Method Using a Power-Variable Calibration Source for Cosmic Microwave Background Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel beam pattern measurement method for the side lobe characterization of cosmic microwave background telescopes. The method employs a power-variable artificial microwave source under feedback control from the detector under test on the telescope. It enables us to extend the dynamic range of the beam pattern measurement without introducing nonlinearity effects from the detector. We conducted a laboratory-based proof-of-concept experiment, measuring the H-plane beam pattern of a horn antenna coupled to a diode detector at 81 GHz. We gained an additional dynamic range of 60.3 dB attributed to the feedback control. In addition, we verified the measurement by comparing it with other reference measurements obtained using conventional methods. The method is also applicable to general optical measurements requiring a high dynamic range to detect subtle nonidealities in the characteristics of optical devices.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework, Bayesian Evidence calculation fOr Model Selection (BEOMS) to evaluate multiple Bayesian model selection methods in the context of determining the equation of state (EOS) for cold neutron star (NS), focusing on their performance with current and next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories. We conduct a systematic comparison of various EOS models by using posterior distributions obtained from EOS-agnostic Bayesian inference of binary parameters applied to GWs from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The cumulative evidence for each model is calculated in a multi-dimensional parameter space characterized by neutron star masses and tidal deformabilities. Our findings indicate that Bayesian model selection is most effective when performed in the two-dimensional subspace of component mass and tidal deformability, requiring fewer events to distinguish between EOS models with high confidence. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between the precision of tidal deformability measurements and the accuracy of model selection, taking into account the evolving sensitivities of current and planned GW observatories. BEOMS offers computational efficiency and can be adapted to execute model selection for gravitational wave data from other sources.</description>

      <title>Search for Lorentz Invariance Violation with spectral lags of GRB 190114C using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) using the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $2\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.96}_{-0.72}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.10^{+2.59}_{-0.64}\times 10^{5}$ for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively and agree with the Bayesian estimates hitherto obtained in a previous work. Therefore, the results from frequentist analysis GRB 190114C agrees with Bayesian analysis and presents yet another proof of principles applications of profile likelihood in the search for LIV.</description>

      <title>Vertically resolved minimal-set k-distribution for thermal infrared absorption: an application to the atmosphere of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FKDM $k$-distribution technique is applied to parameterize absorption of thermal radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere of Venus, targeting modeling scenarios where the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates efficient parameterizations (e.g. climate modeling). Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo method for radiative transfer is built into the $k$-distribution terms construction process, explicitly controlling accuracy. From 16 bands across $10$--$6000~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, the method produces 32 $k$-terms, band-averaged Planck function values and per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. The FKDM $k$-distribution technique does not require the inter-level correlation assumption common for the correlated $k$-distribution method. We supply height-dependent $k(z)$ functions tabulated on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, designed for direct use in radiative transfer solvers and avoiding additional remapping of the pre-tabulated $k$-data. Our implementation of the technique yielded acceptable accuracy below 90~km ($&lt;1.2~\mathrm{K\,day^{-1}}$ for cooling rates; $&lt;2\%$ for fluxes), while requiring substantially fewer $k$-terms than recent implementations of the correlated-$k$ method. A Fortran driver that generates $k(z)$ functions for an arbitrary Venus atmospheric profile is provided in a public repository.</description>
