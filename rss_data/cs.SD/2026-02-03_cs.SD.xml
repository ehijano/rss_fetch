      <title>LPIPS-AttnWav2Lip: Generic Audio-Driven lip synchronization for Talking Head Generation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have shown a growing interest in Audio-driven Talking Head Generation. The primary challenge in talking head generation is achieving audio-visual coherence between the lips and the audio, known as lip synchronization. This paper proposes a generic method, LPIPS-AttnWav2Lip, for reconstructing face images of any speaker based on audio. We used the U-Net architecture based on residual CBAM to better encode and fuse audio and visual modal information. Additionally, the semantic alignment module extends the receptive field of the generator network to obtain the spatial and channel information of the visual features efficiently; and match statistical information of visual features with audio latent vector to achieve the adjustment and injection of the audio content information to the visual information. To achieve exact lip synchronization and to generate realistic high-quality images, our approach adopts LPIPS Loss, which simulates human judgment of image quality and reduces instability possibility during the training process. The proposed method achieves outstanding performance in terms of lip synchronization accuracy and visual quality as demonstrated by subjective and objective evaluation results.

      <title>Multi-Speaker Conversational Audio Deepfake: Taxonomy, Dataset and Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technologies have made audio deepfakes increasingly realistic and accessible, raising significant security and trust concerns. While existing research has largely focused on detecting single-speaker audio deepfakes, real-world malicious applications with multi-speaker conversational settings is also emerging as a major underexplored threat. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual taxonomy of multi-speaker conversational audio deepfakes, distinguishing between partial manipulations (one or multiple speakers altered) and full manipulations (entire conversations synthesized). As a first step, we introduce a new Multi-speaker Conversational Audio Deepfakes Dataset (MsCADD) of 2,830 audio clips containing real and fully synthetic two-speaker conversations, generated using VITS and SoundStorm-based NotebookLM models to simulate natural dialogue with variations in speaker gender, and conversational spontaneity. MsCADD is limited to text-to-speech (TTS) types of deepfake. We benchmark three neural baseline models; LFCC-LCNN, RawNet2, and Wav2Vec 2.0 on this dataset and report performance in terms of F1 score, accuracy, true positive rate (TPR), and true negative rate (TNR). Results show that these baseline models provided a useful benchmark, however, the results also highlight that there is a significant gap in multi-speaker deepfake research in reliably detecting synthetic voices under varied conversational dynamics. Our dataset and benchmarks provide a foundation for future research on deepfake detection in conversational scenarios, which is a highly underexplored area of research but also a major area of threat to trustworthy information in audio settings. The MsCADD dataset is publicly available to support reproducibility and benchmarking by the research community.</description>

      <title>RVCBench: Benchmarking the Robustness of Voice Cloning Across Modern Audio Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern voice cloning (VC) can synthesize speech that closely matches a target speaker from only seconds of reference audio, enabling applications such as personalized speech interfaces and dubbing. In practical deployments, modern audio generation models inevitably encounter noisy reference audios, imperfect text prompts, and diverse downstream processing, which can significantly hurt robustness. Despite rapid progress in VC driven by autoregressive codec-token language models and diffusion-based models, robustness under realistic deployment shifts remains underexplored. This paper introduces RVCBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates Robustness in VC across the full generation pipeline, including input variation, generation challenges, output post-processing, and adversarial perturbations, covering 10 robustness tasks, 225 speakers, 14,370 utterances, and 11 representative modern VC models. Our evaluation uncovers substantial robustness gaps in VC: performance can deteriorate sharply under common input shifts and post-processing; long-context and cross-lingual scenarios further expose stability limitations; and both passive noise and proactive perturbation influence generation robustness. Collectively, these findings provide a unified picture of how current VC models fail in practice and introduce a standardized, open-source testbed to support the development of more robust and deployable VC models. We open-source our project at https://github.com/Nanboy-Ronan/RVCBench.</description>

      <title>Edit Content, Preserve Acoustics: Imperceptible Text-Based Speech Editing via Self-Consistency Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imperceptible text-based speech editing allows users to modify spoken content by altering the transcript. It demands that modified segments fuse seamlessly with the surrounding context. Prevalent methods operating in the acoustic space suffer from inherent content-style entanglement, leading to generation instability and boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework grounded in the principle of "Edit Content, Preserve Acoustics". Our approach relies on two core components: (1) Structural Foundations, which decouples editing into a stable semantic space while delegating acoustic reconstruction to a Flow Matching decoder; and (2) Perceptual Alignment, which employs a novel Self-Consistency Rewards Group Relative Policy Optimization. By leveraging a pre-trained Text-to-Speech model as an implicit critic -- complemented by strict intelligibility and duration constraints -- we effectively align the edited semantic token sequence with the original context. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and non-autoregressive baselines, achieving superior intelligibility, robustness, and perceptual quality.</description>

      <title>Dual-View Predictive Diffusion: Lightweight Speech Enhancement via Spectrogram-Image Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently set new benchmarks in Speech Enhancement (SE). However, most existing score-based models treat speech spectrograms merely as generic 2D images, applying uniform processing that ignores the intrinsic structural sparsity of audio, which results in inefficient spectral representation and prohibitive computational complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose DVPD, an extremely lightweight Dual-View Predictive Diffusion model, which uniquely exploits the dual nature of spectrograms as both visual textures and physical frequency-domain representations across both training and inference stages. Specifically, during training, we optimize spectral utilization via the Frequency-Adaptive Non-uniform Compression (FANC) encoder, which preserves critical low-frequency harmonics while pruning high-frequency redundancies. Simultaneously, we introduce a Lightweight Image-based Spectro-Awareness (LISA) module to capture features from a visual perspective with minimal overhead. During inference, we propose a Training-free Lossless Boost (TLB) strategy that leverages the same dual-view priors to refine generation quality without any additional fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that DVPD achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 35% of the parameters and 40% of the inference MACs compared to SOTA lightweight model, PGUSE. These results highlight DVPD's superior ability to balance high-fidelity speech quality with extreme architectural efficiency.

      <title>The TMU System for the XACLE Challenge: Training Large Audio Language Models with CLAP Pseudo-Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a submission to the x-to-audio alignment (XACLE) challenge. The goal is to predict semantic alignment of a given general audio and text pair. The proposed system is based on a large audio language model (LALM) architecture. We employ a three-stage training pipeline: automated audio captioning pretraining, pretraining with CLAP pseudo-labels, and fine-tuning on the XACLE dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining with CLAP pseudo-labels is the primary performance driver. On the XACLE test set, our system reaches an SRCC of 0.632, significantly outperforming the baseline system (0.334) and securing third place in the challenge team ranking.

      <title>Audio-to-Image Bird Species Retrieval without Audio-Image Pairs via Text Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-to-image retrieval offers an interpretable alternative to audio-only classification for bioacoustic species recognition, but learning aligned audio-image representations is challenging due to the scarcity of paired audio-image data. We propose a simple and data-efficient approach that enables audio-to-image retrieval without any audio-image supervision. Our proposed method uses text as a semantic intermediary: we distill the text embedding space of a pretrained image-text model (BioCLIP-2), which encodes rich visual and taxonomic structure, into a pretrained audio-text model (BioLingual) by fine-tuning its audio encoder with a contrastive objective. This distillation transfers visually grounded semantics into the audio representation, inducing emergent alignment between audio and image embeddings without using images during training. We evaluate the resulting model on multiple bioacoustic benchmarks. The distilled audio encoder preserves audio discriminative power while substantially improving audio-text alignment on focal recordings and soundscape datasets. Most importantly, on the SSW60 benchmark, the proposed approach achieves strong audio-to-image retrieval performance exceeding baselines based on zero-shot model combinations or learned mappings between text embeddings, despite not training on paired audio-image data. These results demonstrate that indirect semantic transfer through text is sufficient to induce meaningful audio-image alignment, providing a practical solution for visually grounded species recognition in data-scarce bioacoustic settings.</description>

      <title>ACE-Step 1.5: Pushing the Boundaries of Open-Source Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ACE-Step v1.5, a highly efficient open-source music foundation model that brings commercial-grade generation to consumer hardware. On commonly used evaluation metrics, ACE-Step v1.5 achieves quality beyond most commercial music models while remaining extremely fast -- under 2 seconds per full song on an A100 and under 10 seconds on an RTX 3090. The model runs locally with less than 4GB of VRAM, and supports lightweight personalization: users can train a LoRA from just a few songs to capture their own style. At its core lies a novel hybrid architecture where the Language Model (LM) functions as an omni-capable planner: it transforms simple user queries into comprehensive song blueprints -- scaling from short loops to 10-minute compositions -- while synthesizing metadata, lyrics, and captions via Chain-of-Thought to guide the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Uniquely, this alignment is achieved through intrinsic reinforcement learning relying solely on the model's internal mechanisms, thereby eliminating the biases inherent in external reward models or human preferences. Beyond standard synthesis, ACE-Step v1.5 unifies precise stylistic control with versatile editing capabilities -- such as cover generation, repainting, and vocal-to-BGM conversion -- while maintaining strict adherence to prompts across 50+ languages. This paves the way for powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators. The code, the model weights and the demo are available at: https://ace-step.github.io/ace-step-v1.5.github.io/</description>

      <title>HierCon: Hierarchical Contrastive Attention for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes generated by modern TTS and voice conversion systems are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real speech, raising serious risks for security and online trust. While state-of-the-art self-supervised models provide rich multi-layer representations, existing detectors treat layers independently and overlook temporal and hierarchical dependencies critical for identifying synthetic artefacts. We propose HierCon, a hierarchical layer attention framework combined with margin-based contrastive learning that models dependencies across temporal frames, neighbouring layers, and layer groups, while encouraging domain-invariant embeddings. Evaluated on ASVspoof 2021 DF and In-the-Wild datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance (1.93% and 6.87% EER), improving over independent layer weighting by 36.6% and 22.5% respectively. The results and attention visualisations confirm that hierarchical modelling enhances generalisation to cross-domain generation techniques and recording conditions.</description>

      <title>TLDiffGAN: A Latent Diffusion-GAN Framework with Temporal Information Fusion for Anomalous Sound Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing generative models for unsupervised anomalous sound detection are limited by their inability to fully capture the complex feature distribution of normal sounds, while the potential of powerful diffusion models in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, TLDiffGAN, which consists of two complementary branches. One branch incorporates a latent diffusion model into the GAN generator for adversarial training, thereby making the discriminator's task more challenging and improving the quality of generated samples. The other branch leverages pretrained audio model encoders to extract features directly from raw audio waveforms for auxiliary discrimination. This framework effectively captures feature representations of normal sounds from both raw audio and Mel spectrograms. Moreover, we introduce a TMixup spectrogram augmentation technique to enhance sensitivity to subtle and localized temporal patterns that are often overlooked. Extensive experiments on the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2 dataset demonstrate the superior detection performance of TLDiffGAN, as well as its strong capability in anomalous time-frequency localization.</description>

      <title>Causally Disentangled Contrastive Learning for Multilingual Speaker Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised speaker embeddings are widely used in speaker verification systems, but prior work has shown that they often encode sensitive demographic attributes, raising fairness and privacy concerns. This paper investigates the extent to which demographic information, specifically gender, age, and accent, is present in SimCLR-trained speaker embeddings and whether such leakage can be mitigated without severely degrading speaker verification performance. We study two debiasing strategies: adversarial training through gradient reversal and a causal bottleneck architecture that explicitly separates demographic and residual information. Demographic leakage is quantified using both linear and nonlinear probing classifiers, while speaker verification performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC and EER. Our results show that gender information is strongly and linearly encoded in baseline embeddings, whereas age and accent are weaker and primarily nonlinearly represented. Adversarial debiasing reduces gender leakage but has limited effect on age and accent and introduces a clear trade-off with verification accuracy. The causal bottleneck further suppresses demographic information, particularly in the residual representation, but incurs substantial performance degradation. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in mitigating demographic leakage in self-supervised speaker embeddings and clarify the trade-offs inherent in current debiasing approaches.</description>

      <title>Attention-weighted Centered Kernel Alignment for Knowledge Distillation in Large Audio-Language Models Applied to Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) has advanced Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), but their size limits deployment in resource-constrained environments. While Knowledge Distillation is effective for LALM compression, existing methods remain underexplored in distilling the cross-modal projection module (Projector), and often struggle with alignment due to differences in feature dimensions. We propose PL-Distill, a KD framework that combines Projector-Level Distillation (PDist) to align audio embeddings and Logits-Level Distillation (LDist) to align output logits. PDist introduces Attention-weighted Centered Kernel Alignment, a novel approach we propose to highlight important time steps and address dimension mismatches. Meanwhile, LDist minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between teacher and student logits from audio and text modalities. On IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, and SAVEE, PL-Distill compresses an 8.4B-parameter teacher to a compact 1.1B-parameter student, consistently outperforming the teacher, state-of-the-art pretrained models, and other KD baselines across all metrics.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attack Against Music Diffusion Models via Generative Manifold Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a specific audio clip was used to train a model, making them a key tool for auditing generative music models for copyright compliance. However, loss-based signals (e.g., reconstruction error) are weakly aligned with human perception in practice, yielding poor separability at the low false-positive rates (FPRs) required for forensics. We propose the Latent Stability Adversarial Probe (LSA-Probe), a white-box method that measures a geometric property of the reverse diffusion: the minimal time-normalized perturbation budget needed to cross a fixed perceptual degradation threshold at an intermediate diffusion state. We show that training members, residing in more stable regions, exhibit a significantly higher degradation cost.</description>

      <title>Voting-based Pitch Estimation with Temporal and Frequential Alignment and Correlation Aware Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The voting method, an ensemble approach for fundamental frequency estimation, is empirically known for its robustness but lacks thorough investigation. This paper provides a principled analysis and improvement of this technique. First, we offer a theoretical basis for its effectiveness, explaining the error variance reduction for fundamental frequency estimation and invoking Condorcet's jury theorem for voiced/unvoiced detection accuracy. To address its practical limitations, we propose two key improvements: 1) a pre-voting alignment procedure to correct temporal and frequential biases among estimators, and 2) a greedy algorithm to select a compact yet effective subset of estimators based on error correlation. Experiments on a diverse dataset of speech, singing, and music show that our proposed method with alignment outperforms individual state-of-the-art estimators in clean conditions and maintains robust voiced/unvoiced detection in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>ParaGSE: Parallel Generative Speech Enhancement with Group-Vector-Quantization-based Neural Speech Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, generative speech enhancement has garnered considerable interest; however, existing approaches are hindered by excessive complexity, limited efficiency, and suboptimal speech quality. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel parallel generative speech enhancement (ParaGSE) framework that leverages a group vector quantization (GVQ)-based neural speech codec. The GVQ-based codec adopts separate VQs to produce mutually independent tokens, enabling efficient parallel token prediction in ParaGSE. Specifically, ParaGSE leverages the GVQ-based codec to encode degraded speech into distinct tokens, predicts the corresponding clean tokens through parallel branches conditioned on degraded spectral features, and ultimately reconstructs clean speech via the codec decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that ParaGSE consistently produces superior enhanced speech compared to both discriminative and generative baselines, under a wide range of distortions including noise, reverberation, band-limiting, and their mixtures. Furthermore, empowered by parallel computation in token prediction, ParaGSE attains about a 1.5-fold improvement in generation efficiency on CPU compared with serial generative speech enhancement approaches.</description>

      <title>Speaking Without Sound: Multi-speaker Silent Speech Voicing with Facial Inputs Only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generating multi-speaker speech without relying on any audible inputs. Our approach leverages silent electromyography (EMG) signals to capture linguistic content, while facial images are used to match with the vocal identity of the target speaker. Notably, we present a pitch-disentangled content embedding that enhances the extraction of linguistic content from EMG signals. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our method can generate multi-speaker speech without any audible inputs and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed pitch-disentanglement approach.</description>

      <title>LipSody: Lip-to-Speech Synthesis with Enhanced Prosody Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lip-to-speech synthesis aims to generate speech audio directly from silent facial video by reconstructing linguistic content from lip movements, providing valuable applications in situations where audio signals are unavailable or degraded. While recent diffusion-based models such as LipVoicer have demonstrated impressive performance in reconstructing linguistic content, they often lack prosodic consistency. In this work, we propose LipSody, a lip-to-speech framework enhanced for prosody consistency. LipSody introduces a prosody-guiding strategy that leverages three complementary cues: speaker identity extracted from facial images, linguistic content derived from lip movements, and emotional context inferred from face video. Experimental results demonstrate that LipSody substantially improves prosody-related metrics, including global and local pitch deviations, energy consistency, and speaker similarity, compared to prior approaches.</description>

      <title>DFKI-Speech System for WildSpoof Challenge: A robust framework for SASV In-the-Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the DFKI-Speech system developed for the WildSpoof Challenge under the Spoofing aware Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV) track. We propose a robust SASV framework in which a spoofing detector and a speaker verification (SV) network operate in tandem. The spoofing detector employs a self-supervised speech embedding extractor as the frontend, combined with a state-of-the-art graph neural network backend. In addition, a top-3 layer based mixture-of-experts (MoE) is used to fuse high-level and low-level features for effective spoofed utterance detection. For speaker verification, we adapt a low-complexity convolutional neural network that fuses 2D and 1D features at multiple scales, trained with the SphereFace loss. Additionally, contrastive circle loss is applied to adaptively weight positive and negative pairs within each training batch, enabling the network to better distinguish between hard and easy sample pairs. Finally, fixed imposter cohort based AS Norm score normalization and model ensembling are used to further enhance the discriminative capability of the speaker verification system.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders as Universal Speech Enhancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised speech enhancement methods have been very successful. However, in practical scenarios, there is a lack of clean speech, and self-supervised learning-based (SSL) speech enhancement methods that offer comparable enhancement performance and can be applied to other speech-related downstream applications are desired. In this work, we develop a masked autoencoder based universal speech enhancer that is agnostic to the type of distortion affecting speech, can handle multiple distortions simultaneously, and is trained in a self-supervised manner. An augmentation stack adds further distortions to the noisy input data. The masked autoencoder model learns to remove the added distortions along with reconstructing the masked regions of the spectrogram during pre-training. The pre-trained embeddings are then used by fine-tuning models trained on a small amount of paired data for specific downstream tasks. We evaluate the pre-trained features for denoising and dereverberation downstream tasks. We explore different augmentations (like single or multi-speaker) in the pre-training augmentation stack and the effect of different noisy input feature representations (like $log1p$ compression) on pre-trained embeddings and downstream fine-tuning enhancement performance. We show that the proposed method not only outperforms the baseline but also achieves state-of-the-art performance for both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation datasets.</description>

      <title>VoxServe: Streaming-Centric Serving System for Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying modern Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) in streaming settings requires systems that provide low latency, high throughput, and strong guarantees of streamability. Existing systems fall short of supporting diverse models flexibly and efficiently. We present VoxServe, a unified serving system for SpeechLMs that optimizes streaming performance. VoxServe introduces a model-execution abstraction that decouples model architecture from system-level optimizations, thereby enabling support for diverse SpeechLM architectures within a single framework. Building on this abstraction, VoxServe implements streaming-aware scheduling and an asynchronous inference pipeline to improve end-to-end efficiency. Evaluations across multiple modern SpeechLMs show that VoxServe achieves 10-20x higher throughput than existing implementations at comparable latency while maintaining high streaming viability. The code of VoxServe is available at https://github.com/vox-serve/vox-serve.</description>

      <title>Kanade: A Simple Disentangled Tokenizer for Spoken Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A good language model starts with a good tokenizer. Tokenization is especially important for speech modeling, which must handle continuous signals that mix linguistic and non-linguistic information. A speech tokenizer should extract phonetics and prosody, suppress linguistically irrelevant information like speaker identity, and enable high-quality synthesis. We present Kanade, a single-layer disentangled speech tokenizer that realizes this ideal. Kanade separates out acoustic constants to create a single stream of tokens that captures rich phonetics and prosody. It does so without the need for auxiliary methods that existing disentangled codecs often rely on. Experiments show that Kanade achieves state-of-the-art speaker disentanglement and lexical availability, while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>MTAVG-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Multi-Talker Dialogue-Centric Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-audio-video (T2AV) generation have enabled models to synthesize audio-visual videos with multi-participant dialogues. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain largely designed for human-recorded videos or single-speaker settings. As a result, potential errors that occur in generated multi-talker dialogue videos, such as identity drift, unnatural turn transitions, and audio-visual misalignment, cannot be effectively captured and analyzed. To address this issue, we introduce MTAVG-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating audio-visual multi-speaker dialogue generation. MTAVG-Bench is built via a semi-automatic pipeline, where 1.8k videos are generated using multiple popular models with carefully designed prompts, yielding 2.4k manually annotated QA pairs. The benchmark evaluates multi-speaker dialogue generation at four levels: audio-visual signal fidelity, temporal attribute consistency, social interaction, and cinematic expression. We benchmark 12 proprietary and open-source omni-models on MTAVG-Bench, with Gemini 3 Pro achieving the strongest overall performance, while leading open-source models remain competitive in signal fidelity and consistency. Overall, MTAVG-Bench enables fine-grained failure analysis for rigorous model comparison and targeted video generation refinement.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Generative Audio Compression at 0.275kbps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity general audio compression at ultra-low bitrates is crucial for applications ranging from low-bandwidth communication to generative audio-language modeling. Traditional audio compression methods and contemporary neural codecs are fundamentally designed for waveform reconstruction. As a result, when operating at ultra-low bitrates, these methods degrade rapidly and often fail to preserve essential information, leading to severe acoustic artifacts and pronounced semantic distortion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Generative Audio Compression (GAC), a novel paradigm shift from signal fidelity to task-oriented effectiveness. Implemented within the AI Flow framework, GAC is theoretically grounded in the Law of Information Capacity. These foundations posit that abundant computational power can be leveraged at the receiver to offset extreme communication bottlenecks--exemplifying the More Computation, Less Bandwidth philosophy. By integrating semantic understanding at the transmitter with scalable generative synthesis at the receiver, GAC offloads the information burden to powerful model priors. Our 1.8B-parameter model achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of 32kHz general audio at an unprecedented bitrate of 0.275kbps. Even at 0.175kbps, it still preserves a strong intelligible audio transmission capability, which represents an about 3000x compression ratio, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art neural codecs in maintaining both perceptual quality and semantic consistency.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Binary Attention: An Energy-Efficient Fusion Framework for Audio-Visual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective multimodal fusion requires mechanisms that can capture complex cross-modal dependencies while remaining computationally scalable for real-world deployment. Existing audio-visual fusion approaches face a fundamental trade-off: attention-based methods effectively model cross-modal relationships but incur quadratic computational complexity that prevents hierarchical, multi-scale architectures, while efficient fusion strategies rely on simplistic concatenation that fails to extract complementary cross-modal information. We introduce CMQKA, a novel cross-modal fusion mechanism that achieves linear O(N) complexity through efficient binary operations, enabling scalable hierarchical fusion previously infeasible with conventional attention. CMQKA employs bidirectional cross-modal Query-Key attention to extract complementary spatiotemporal features and uses learnable residual fusion to preserve modality-specific characteristics while enriching representations with cross-modal information. Building upon CMQKA, we present SNNergy, an energy-efficient multimodal fusion framework with a hierarchical architecture that processes inputs through progressively decreasing spatial resolutions and increasing semantic abstraction. This multi-scale fusion capability allows the framework to capture both local patterns and global context across modalities. Implemented with event-driven binary spike operations, SNNergy achieves remarkable energy efficiency while maintaining fusion effectiveness and establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging audio-visual benchmarks, including CREMA-D, AVE, and UrbanSound8K-AV, significantly outperforming existing multimodal fusion baselines. Our framework advances multimodal fusion by introducing a scalable fusion mechanism that enables hierarchical cross-modal integration with practical energy efficiency for real-world audio-visual intelligence systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a lightweight multimodal baseline for emotion recognition in conversations using the SemEval-2024 Task 3 dataset built from the sitcom Friends. The goal of this report is not to propose a novel state-of-the-art method, but to document an accessible reference implementation that combines (i) a transformer-based text classifier and (ii) a self-supervised speech representation model, with a simple late-fusion ensemble. We report the baseline setup and empirical results obtained under a limited training protocol, highlighting when multimodal fusion improves over unimodal models. This preprint is provided for transparency and to support future, more rigorous comparisons.</description>

      <title>Adapting Where It Matters: Depth-Aware Adaptation for Efficient Multilingual Speech Recognition in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent speech foundation models excel at multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) for high-resource languages, but adapting them to low-resource languages remains challenging due to data scarcity and efficiency constraints. Full-model fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, while parameter-efficient methods like LoRA apply adaptation uniformly across layers, overlooking internal representations thus compromising effectiveness and efficiency. We analyze multilingual ASR models and reveal a U-shaped adaptability pattern: early and late layers are language-specific and require more adaptation, while intermediate layers retain shared semantics and need less. Building on this observation, we propose DAMA, a Depth-Aware Model Adaptation framework that allocates adaptation capacity according to each layer's role. DAMA also introduces Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization to constrain adaptation and preserve the U-shaped pattern, as well as a frozen middle-layer basis for further efficiency. Evaluated on 18 low-resource languages across two benchmark datasets, DAMA matches or surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy with 80% fewer trainable parameters, achieves a 29% error reduction under extreme data scarcity, and significantly improves memory, training time, and computational efficiency over baselines. These results highlight the benefits of structure-aware adaptation for efficient, scalable multilingual ASR.</description>

      <title>Bias in the Ear of the Listener: Assessing Sensitivity in Audio Language Models Across Linguistic, Demographic, and Positional Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first systematic investigation of speech bias in multilingual MLLMs. We construct and release the BiasInEar dataset, a speech-augmented benchmark based on Global MMLU Lite, spanning English, Chinese, and Korean, balanced by gender and accent, and totaling 70.8 hours ($\approx$4,249 minutes) of speech with 11,200 questions. Using four complementary metrics (accuracy, entropy, APES, and Fleiss' $\kappa$), we evaluate nine representative models under linguistic (language and accent), demographic (gender), and structural (option order) perturbations. Our findings reveal that MLLMs are relatively robust to demographic factors but highly sensitive to language and option order, suggesting that speech can amplify existing structural biases. Moreover, architectural design and reasoning strategy substantially affect robustness across languages. Overall, this study establishes a unified framework for assessing fairness and robustness in speech-integrated LLMs, bridging the gap between text- and speech-based evaluation.

      <title>SSNAPS: Audio-Visual Separation of Speech and Background Noise with Diffusion Inverse Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of audio-visual single-microphone speech separation and enhancement in the presence of real-world environmental noise. Our approach is based on generative inverse sampling, where we model clean speech and ambient noise with dedicated diffusion priors and jointly leverage them to recover all underlying sources. To achieve this, we reformulate a recent inverse sampler to match our setting. We evaluate on mixtures of 1, 2, and 3 speakers with noise and show that, despite being entirely unsupervised, our method consistently outperforms leading supervised baselines in \ac{WER} across all conditions. We further extend our framework to handle off-screen speaker separation. Moreover, the high fidelity of the separated noise component makes it suitable for downstream acoustic scene detection.

      <title>Evaluating Acoustic Data Transmission Schemes for Ad-Hoc Communication Between Nearby Smart Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic data transmission offers a compelling alternative to Bluetooth and NFC by leveraging the ubiquitous speakers and microphones in smartphones and IoT devices. However, most research in this field relies on simulations or limited on-device testing, which makes the real-world reliability of proposed schemes difficult to assess. We systematically reviewed 31 acoustic communication studies for commodity devices and found that none provided accessible source code. After contacting authors and re-implementing three promising schemes, we assembled a testbed of eight representative acoustic communication systems. Using over 11000 smartphone transmissions in both realistic indoor environments and an anechoic chamber, we provide a systematic and repeatable methodology for evaluating the reliability and generalizability of these schemes under real-world conditions. Our results show that many existing schemes face challenges in practical usage, largely due to severe multipath propagation indoors and varying audio characteristics across device models. To support future research and foster more robust evaluations, we release our re-implementations alongside the first comprehensive dataset of real-world acoustic transmissions. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous on-device testing and underscore the need for robust design strategies to bridge the gap between simulation results and reliable IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>CAARMA: Class Augmentation with Adversarial Mixup Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16718v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker verification is a typical zero-shot learning task, where inference of unseen classes is performed by comparing embeddings of test instances to known examples. The models performing inference must hence naturally generate embeddings that cluster same-class instances compactly, while maintaining separation across classes. In order to learn to do so, they are typically trained on a large number of classes (speakers), often using specialized losses. However real-world speaker datasets often lack the class diversity needed to effectively learn this in a generalizable manner. We introduce CAARMA, a class augmentation framework that addresses this problem by generating synthetic classes through data mixing in the embedding space, expanding the number of training classes. To ensure the authenticity of the synthetic classes we adopt a novel adversarial refinement mechanism that minimizes categorical distinctions between synthetic and real classes. We evaluate CAARMA on multiple speaker verification tasks, as well as other representative zero-shot comparison-based speech analysis tasks and obtain consistent improvements: our framework demonstrates a significant improvement of 8\% over all baseline models.

      <title>PAL: Probing Audio Encoders via LLMs -- Audio Information Transfer into LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of audio perception into large language models (LLMs) is an emerging research area for enabling machine listening applications, yet efficient transfer of rich audio semantics from audio encoders to LLMs remains underexplored. The most widely used integration paradigm projects audio-encoder output tokens into the LLM input space (e.g., via an MLP or a Q-Former) and then prepends or inserts them into the text token sequence. We refer to this generic scheme as Prepend to the LLM's input token space (PLITS) integration. We propose an efficient alternative, Lightweight Audio LLM Integration (LAL). LAL injects audio representations solely through the attention mechanism at selected LLM layers, bypassing the feed-forward module. It encodes rich audio semantics at an appropriate level of abstraction for integration into different transformer blocks, substantially reducing computational overhead compared to existing approaches. We further introduce PAL, a hybrid integration approach for efficiently Probing Audio encoders via LLM. PAL applies PLITS only to a compact set of summary tokens while integrating the full audio token sequence via LAL. Under an identical training curriculum, LAL consistently matches or outperforms existing integration approaches across multiple base LLMs and tasks, with improvements of up to 30% over a strong PLITS baseline, while reducing memory usage by about 60% and increasing throughput by about 190%. Moreover, PAL matches or exceeds PLITS performance while offering substantially better computational and memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Automatic Evaluation and High-Quality Pseudo-Parallel Dataset Construction for Audio Editing: A Human-in-the-Loop Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio editing aims to manipulate audio content based on textual descriptions, supporting tasks such as adding, removing, or replacing audio events. Despite recent progress, the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and comprehensive evaluation metrics remains a major challenge for both assessing audio editing quality and improving the task itself. In this work, we propose a novel approach for audio editing task by incorporating expert knowledge into both the evaluation and dataset construction processes: 1) First, we establish AuditScore, the first comprehensive dataset for subjective evaluation of audio editing, consisting of over 6,300 edited samples generated from 7 representative audio editing frameworks and 23 system configurations. Each sample is annotated by professional raters on three key aspects of audio editing quality: overall Quality, Relevance to editing intent, and Faithfulness to original features. 2) Based on this dataset, we systematically propose AuditEval, a family of automatic MOS-style evaluators tailored for audio editing, covering both SSL-based and LLM-based approaches. It addresses the lack of effective objective metrics and the prohibitive cost of subjective evaluation in this field. 3) We further leverage AuditEval to evaluate and filter a large amount of synthetically mixed editing pairs, mining a high-quality pseudo-parallel subset by selecting the most plausible samples. Comprehensive experiments validate that our expert-informed filtering strategy effectively yields higher-quality data, while also exposing the limitations of traditional objective metrics and the advantages of AuditEval. The dataset, codes and tools can be found at: https://github.com/NKU-HLT/AuditEval.</description>

      <title>Estimating Respiratory Effort from Nocturnal Breathing Sounds for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent condition with significant health consequences, yet many patients remain undiagnosed due to the complexity and cost of over-night polysomnography. Acoustic-based screening provides a scalable alternative, yet performance is limited by environmental noise and the lack of physiological context. Respiratory effort is a key signal used in clinical scoring of OSA events, but current approaches require additional contact sensors that reduce scalability and patient comfort. This paper presents the first study to estimate respiratory effort directly from nocturnal audio, enabling physiological context to be recovered from sound alone. We propose a latent-space fusion framework that integrates the estimated effort embeddings with acoustic features for OSA detection. Using a dataset of 157 nights from 103 participants recorded in home environments, our respiratory effort estimator achieves a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.48, capturing meaningful respiratory dynamics. Fusing effort and audio improves sensitivity and AUC over audio-only baselines, especially at low apnoea-hypopnoea index thresholds. The proposed approach requires only smartphone audio at test time, which enables sensor-free, scalable, and longitudinal OSA monitoring.</description>

      <title>SupCLAP: Controlling Optimization Trajectory Drift in Audio-Text Contrastive Learning with Support Vector Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining, which aims to unify multimodal representations in a shared embedding space, serves as a cornerstone for building a wide range of applications, from cross-modal retrieval to cutting-edge multimodal large language models. However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method. Notably, our method is highly efficient, it operates without the need for extra training data or inference computation, and adds only a negligible overhead to the training.</description>

      <title>The T12 System for AudioMOS Challenge 2025: Audio Aesthetics Score Prediction System Using KAN- and VERSA-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an audio aesthetics score (AES) prediction system by CyberAgent (AESCA) for AudioMOS Challenge 2025 (AMC25) Track 2. The AESCA comprises a Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN)-based audiobox aesthetics and a predictor from the metric scores using the VERSA toolkit. In the KAN-based predictor, we replaced each multi-layer perceptron layer in the baseline model with a group-rational KAN and trained the model with labeled and pseudo-labeled audio samples. The VERSA-based predictor was designed as a regression model using extreme gradient boosting, incorporating outputs from existing metrics. Both the KAN- and VERSA-based models predicted the AES, including the four evaluation axes. The final AES values were calculated using an ensemble model that combined four KAN-based models and a VERSA-based model. Our proposed T12 system yielded the best correlations among the submitted systems, in three axes at the utterance level, two axes at the system level, and the overall average. We also released the inference model of the proposed KAN-based predictor (KAN #1-#4).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept-based interpretability methods like TCAV require clean, well-separated positive and negative examples for each concept. Existing music datasets lack this structure: tags are sparse, noisy, or ill-defined. We introduce ConceptCaps, a dataset of 23k music-caption-audio triplets with explicit labels from a 200-attribute taxonomy. Our pipeline separates semantic modeling from text generation: a VAE learns plausible attribute co-occurrence patterns, a fine-tuned LLM converts attribute lists into professional descriptions, and MusicGen synthesizes corresponding audio. This separation improves coherence and controllability over end-to-end approaches. We validate the dataset through audio-text alignment (CLAP), linguistic quality metrics (BERTScore, MAUVE), and TCAV analysis confirming that concept probes recover musically meaningful patterns. Dataset and code are available online.</description>

      <title>Music Plagiarism Detection: Problem Formulation and a Segment-based Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the problem of music plagiarism has emerged as an even more pressing social issue. As music information retrieval research advances, there is a growing effort to address issues related to music plagiarism. However, many studies, including our previous work, have conducted research without clearly defining what the music plagiarism detection task actually involves. This lack of a clear definition has slowed research progress and made it hard to apply results to real-world scenarios. To fix this situation, we defined how Music Plagiarism Detection is different from other MIR tasks and explained what problems need to be solved. We introduce the Similar Music Pair dataset to support this newly defined task. In addition, we propose a method based on segment transcription as one way to solve the task. Our demo and dataset are available at https://github.com/Mippia/ICASSP2026-MPD.</description>

      <title>DeepGB-TB: A Risk-Balanced Cross-Attention Gradient-Boosted Convolutional Network for Rapid, Interpretable Tuberculosis Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors. To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications. DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851, representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed, affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB control.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs between structural richness and communication efficiency in music network representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music is a structured and perceptually rich sequence of sounds in time with well-defined symbolic features, whose perception is shaped by the interplay of expectation and uncertainty. Network science offers a powerful framework for studying its structural organization and communication efficiency. However, it remains unclear how feature selection affects the properties of reconstructed networks and perceptual alignment. Here, we systematically compare eight encodings of musical sequences, ranging from single-feature descriptions to richer multi-feature combinations. We show that representational choices fundamentally shape network topology, the distribution of uncertainty, and the estimated communication efficiency under perceptual constraints. Single-feature representations compress sequences into dense transition structures that support efficient communication, yielding high entropy rates with low modeled perceptual error, but they discard structural richness. By contrast, multi-feature representations preserve descriptive detail and structural specificity, expanding the state space and producing sharper transition profiles and lower entropy rates, which leads to higher modeled perceptual error. Across representations, we found that uncertainty increasingly concentrates in nodes with higher diffusion-based centrality while their perceptual error remains low, unveiling an interplay between predictable structure and localized surprise. Together, these results show that feature choice directly shapes music network representation, describing trade-offs between descriptive richness and communication efficiency and suggesting structural conditions that may support efficient learning and prediction.</description>

      <title>Investigating Modality Contribution in Audio LLMs for Music</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low, models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in explainable AI and audio.</description>

      <title>Do Bias Benchmarks Generalise? Evidence from Voice-based Evaluation of Gender Bias in SpeechLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe that assumption. We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour transferability in future models and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: A comparative exploration of Speech-LLM and end-to-end architecture for multilingual conversational ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The INTERSPEECH 2025 Challenge on Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Models (MLC-SLM) promotes multilingual conversational ASR with large language models (LLMs). Our previous SHNU-mASR system adopted a competitive parallel-speech-encoder architecture that integrated Whisper and mHuBERT with an LLM. However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets. Nonetheless, we find that our final LLM-based ASR still does not match the performance of a fine-tuned E2E Whisper model, providing valuable empirical guidance for future Speech-LLM design. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/1535176727/MLC-SLM.</description>

      <title>FastSLM: Hierarchical Frame Q-Former for Effective Speech Modality Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision, language, and video understanding tasks, scaling them to long-form speech remains a critical bottleneck due to the explosive growth of input tokens. Existing speech-language models typically project high-frame-rate acoustic features directly into the LLM input space, rendering long-context processing computationally prohibitive as audio duration increases. In this paper, we present FastSLM, a token-efficient architecture designed to overcome this scalability limit through extreme temporal compression. At its core is the Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ-Former), which progressively distills local acoustic details into compact, semantically rich representations across multiple temporal scales. This hierarchical abstraction reduces the speech representation rate to just 1.67 tokens per second, achieving a 93 percent reduction in tokens compared to standard frame-level adapters, while preserving the critical context required for complex reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FastSLM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on long-form benchmarks, despite operating with significantly lower FLOPs and parameter counts. Our findings establish that extreme token compression is a viable pathway to making real-time, long-context speech understanding feasible for LLMs, even under strict computational constraints.

      <title>Language Family Matters: Evaluating LLM-Based ASR Across Linguistic Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems achieve strong performance with limited resources by linking a frozen speech encoder to a pretrained LLM via a lightweight connector. Prior work trains a separate connector per language, overlooking linguistic relatedness. We propose an efficient and novel connector-sharing strategy based on linguistic family membership, enabling one connector per family, and empirically validate its effectiveness across two multilingual LLMs and two real-world corpora spanning curated and crowd-sourced speech. Our results show that family-based connectors reduce parameter count while improving generalization across domains, offering a practical and scalable strategy for multilingual ASR deployment.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Spatialized Auditory Cues for Rapid Attention Capture in XR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In time-critical eXtended reality (XR) scenarios where users must rapidly reorient their attention to hazards, alerts, or instructions while engaged in a primary task, spatial audio can provide an immediate directional cue without occupying visual bandwidth. However, such scenarios can afford only a brief auditory exposure, requiring users to interpret sound direction quickly and without extended listening or head-driven refinement. This paper reports a controlled exploratory study of rapid spatial-audio localization in XR. Using HRTF-rendered broadband stimuli presented from a semi-dense set of directions around the listener, we quantify how accurately users can infer coarse direction from brief audio alone. We further examine the effects of short-term visuo-auditory feedback training as a lightweight calibration mechanism. Our findings show that brief spatial cues can convey coarse directional information, and that even short calibration can improve users' perception of aural signals. While these results highlight the potential of spatial audio for rapid attention guidance, they also show that auditory cues alone may not provide sufficient precision for complex or high-stakes tasks, and that spatial audio may be most effective when complemented by other sensory modalities or visual cues, without relying on head-driven refinement. We leverage this study on spatial audio as a preliminary investigation into a first-stage attention-guidance channel for wearable XR (e.g., VR head-mounted displays and AR smart glasses), and provide design insights on stimulus selection and calibration for time-critical use.</description>

      <title>Attention Isn't All You Need for Emotion Recognition:Domain Features Outperform Transformers on the EAV Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9% to 65.56% (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved 67.62% (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached 75.30%, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved 72.68% (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.</description>
