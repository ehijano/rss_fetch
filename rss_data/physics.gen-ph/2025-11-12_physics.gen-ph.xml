      <title>Mathematical basis, phase transitions and singularities of (3+1)-dimensional phi4 scalar field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lambda phi4 scalar field model that can be applied to interpret pion-pion scattering and properties of hadrons. In this work, the mathematical basis, phase transitions and singularities of a (3+1)-dimensional (i.e., (3+1)D) phi4 scalar field model are investigated. It is found that as a specific example of topological quantum field theories, the (3+1)D phi4 scalar field model must be set up on the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework and dealt with the parameter space of complex time (or complex temperature). The use of the time average and the topologic Lorentz transformation representing Reidemeister moves ensure the integrability, which takes into account for the contributions of nontrivial topological structures to physical properties of the many-body interacting system. The ergodic hypothesis is violated at finite temperatures in the (3+1)D phi4 scalar field model. Because the quantum field theories with ultraviolet cutoff can be mapped to the models in statistical mechanics, the (3+1)D phi4 scalar field model with ultraviolet cutoff is studied by inspecting its relation with the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model. Furthermore, the direct relation between the coupling K in the 3D Ising model and the bare coupling lambda0 in the (3+1)D phi4 scalar field model is determined in the strong coupling limit. The results obtained in the present work can be utilized to investigate thermodynamic physical properties and critical phenomena of quantum (scalar) field theories.</description>

      <title>Physics is simple only when analyzed locally</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of a reference frame in General Relativity is achieved through the construction of a congruence of time-like world-lines. In this framework, splitting techniques enable us to express physical phenomena in analogy with Special Relativity, thereby realizing the local description in terms of Minkowski spacetime in accordance with the equivalence principle. This approach holds promise for elucidating the foundational principles of relativistic gravitational physics, as it illustrates how its 4-dimensional mathematical model manifests in practical measurement processes conducted in both space and time. In addition, we show how, within this framework, the Newtonian gravitational force naturally emerges as an effect of the non-geodesic path of the reference frame.</description>

      <title>Non-Gravitational Acceleration in 3I ATLAS: Constraints on Exotic Volatile Outgassing in Interstellar Comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS exhibited a measurable nongravitational acceleration similar in form to that of 1I/'Oumuamua but of smaller magnitude. Using thermophysical and Monte Carlo models, we show that this acceleration can be fully explained by anisotropic outgassing of conventional volatiles, primarily CO and CO2, under realistic surface and rotational conditions. The model includes diurnal and obliquity-averaged energy balance, empirical vapor-pressure relations, and collimated jet emission from localized active regions. Mixed CO-CO2 compositions reproduce both the magnitude and direction of the observed acceleration with physically plausible active fractions below one percent for nucleus radii between 0.5 and 3 km. Less volatile species such as NH3 and CH4 underproduce thrust at equilibrium temperatures near 1 AU. These results eliminate the need for nonphysical or exotic explanations and define thermophysical limits for natural acceleration mechanisms in interstellar comets.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretation of the Redshift Evolution of H_0(z)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses of the Master Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample have revealed a mild redshift dependence in the inferred local Hubble parameter, often expressed as tilde{H}_0(z) = H_0 (1+z)^{-\alpha}, where \alpha quantifies possible departures from the standard cosmological time dilation relation. In this work, we show that such an empirical scaling can be interpreted as a purely geometric effect arising from a small, gauge-dependent normalization of cosmic time within the Robertson-Walker metric. This interpretation naturally unifies the observed redshift evolution of tilde{H}_0(z) and the corresponding deviation in SN Ia light-curve durations under a single geometric time-normalization framework. We demonstrate that this mapping leaves all background distances--linked to the Hubble radius in the general-relativistic frame--unchanged, while the apparent evolution in SN Ia luminosity distances arises from the redshift dependence of the Chandrasekhar mass. The result provides a unified and observationally consistent explanation of the mild Hubble-tension trend as a manifestation of the geometric structure of cosmic time rather than a modification of the expansion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological Structure of Infrared QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the infrared structure of QCD within the adiabatic approximation, where soft gluon configurations evolve slowly compared to the fermionic modes. In this formulation, the functional space of gauge connections replaces spacetime as the natural arena for the theory, and the long-distance behavior is encoded in quantized Berry phases associated with the infrared clouds. Our results suggest that the infrared sector of QCD exhibits features reminiscent of a \emph{topological phase}, similar to those encountered in condensed-matter systems, where topological protection replaces dynamical confinement at low energies. In this geometric framework, color-neutral composites such as quark--gluon and gluon--gluon clouds arise as topological bound states described by functional holonomies. Illustrative applications to hadronic excitations are discussed within this approach, including mesonic and baryonic examples. This perspective provides a unified picture of infrared dressing and topological quantization, establishing a natural bridge between non-Abelian gauge theory, adiabatic Berry phases, and the topology of the space of gauge configurations.</description>

      <title>Einstein and Debye temperatures, electron-phonon coupling constant and a probable mechanism for ambient-pressure room-temperature superconductivity in intercalated graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ksenofontov et al (arXiv:2510.03256) observed ambient pressure room-temperature superconductivity in graphite intercalated with lithium-based alloys with transition temperature (according to magnetization measurements) $T_c=330$ $K$. Here, I analyzed the reported temperature dependent resistivity data $\rho(T)$ in these graphite-intercalated samples and found that $\rho(T)$ is well described by the model of two series resistors, where each resistor is described as either an Einstein conductor or a Bloch-Gr\"uneisen conductor. Deduced Einstein and Debye temperatures are $\Theta_{E,1} \approx 250$ $K$ and $\Theta_{E,2} \approx 1,600$ $K$, and $\Theta_{D,1} \approx 300$ $K$ and $\Theta_{D,2} \approx 2,200$ $K$, respectively. Following the McMillan formalism, from the deduced $\Theta_{E,2}$ and $\Theta_{D,2}$, the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda_{e-ph} = 2.2 - 2.6$ was obtained. This value of $\lambda_{e-ph}$ is approximately equal to the value of $\lambda_{e-ph}$ in highly compressed superconducting hydrides. Based on this, I can propose that the observed room-temperature superconductivity in intercalated graphite is localized in nanoscale Sr-Ca-Li metallic flakes/particles, which adopt the phonon spectrum from the surrounding bulk graphite matrix, and as a result, conventional electron-phonon superconductivity arises in these nano-flakes/particles at room temperature. Experimental data reported by Ksenofontov et al (arXiv:2510.03256) on trapped magnetic flux decay in intercalated graphite samples supports the proposition.</description>
