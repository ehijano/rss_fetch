      <title>On the spectrum of electric quantum walk and related CMV matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that for a family of quantum walk models with electric fields, the spectrum is the unit circle for any irrational field. The result also holds for the associated CMV matrices defined by skew-shifts. Generalizations to CMV matrices with skew-shifts on higher dimensional torus are also obtained.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of boundary spin correlations in non-integrable Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-integrable 2D Ising models obtained by perturbing the nearest-neighbor model via a weak, finite range potential which preserves translation and spin-flip symmetry, and we study its critical theory in the half-plane. We prove that the leading order long-distance behavior of the correlation functions for spins on the boundary is the same as for the nearest-neighbor model, up to an analytic multiplicative renormalization constant. In particular, the scaling limit is the Pfaffian of an explicit matrix. The proof is based on an exact representation of the generating function of correlations in terms of a Grassmann integral and on a multiscale analysis thereof, generalizing previous results to include observables located on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Conformal Bootstrap for surfaces with boundary in Liouville CFT. Part 1: Segal axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first part of the proof of the conformal bootstrap for Liouville conformal field theory on surfaces with a boundary, devoted to Segal's axioms in this context. We introduce the notion of Segal's amplitudes on surfaces with corners and prove the gluing property for such amplitudes. The semi-group of half-annuli and its generator are studied and we develop the necessary material for proving its spectral decomposition using scattering theory in the companion paper \cite{GRW2}. The Segal gluing properties and the spectral decomposition allows us to prove the conformal bootstrap formula for correlation functions of Liouville conformal field theory with a boundary. This has several important applications to the study of conformal blocks (analyticity and convergence) in \cite{remypreprint}, in the construction of a unitary representation of mapping class group in the space of conformal blocks, and the study of random moduli \cite{ARSmoduliRPM} in Liouville quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Toward stringy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a first step towards developing a new language to describe causal structure, event horizons, and quantum extremal surfaces (QES) for the bulk description of holographic systems beyond the standard Einstein gravity regime. By considering the structure of boundary operator algebras, we introduce a stringy ``causal depth parameter'', which quantifies the depth of the emergent radial direction in the bulk, and a certain notion of ergodicity on the boundary. We define stringy event horizons in terms of the half-sided inclusion property, which is related to a stronger notion of boundary ergodic or quantum chaotic behavior. Using our definition, we argue that above the Hawking--Page temperature, there is an emergent sharp horizon structure in the large $N$ limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang--Mills at finite nonzero 't Hooft coupling. In contrast, some previously considered toy models of black hole information loss do not have a stringy horizon. Our methods can also be used to probe violations of the equivalence principle for the bulk gravitational system, and to explore aspects of stringy nonlocality.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the existence of eigenvalues in the gap of the essential spectrum of the one-dimensional Dirac operator in the presence of a bounded potential. We employ a generalized variational principle to prove existence of such eigenvalues, estimate how many eigenvalues there are, and give upper and lower bounds for them.</description>

      <title>The $q$-generalised multinomial/KL-divergence correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic correspondence between the probability mass function of the $q$-deformed multinomial distribution and the $q$-generalised Kullback-Leibler divergence, also known as Tsallis relative entropy, is established. The probability mass function is generalised using the $q$-deformed algebra developed within the framework of nonextensive statistics, leading to the emergence of a family of divergence measures in the asymptotic limit as the system size increases. The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when $q$ is interpreted as an entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients naturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy through a one-parameter generalisation. Some fundamental properties of these extended divergences are also explored.</description>

      <title>On Uniform Functions on Configuration Spaces of Large Scale Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic large scale interacting systems can be studied via the observables, i.e. functions on the underlying configuration space. In our previous article, we introduced the concept of uniform functions, which are suitable class of functions on configuration spaces underlying stochastic systems on infinite graphs. An important consequence is the successful characterization of conserved quantities without introducing the notion of stationary distributions. In this article, we further develop the theory of uniform functions and construct the theory independent of any choice of a base state. Furthermore, we generalize the notion of interactions given in our previous article to accommodate the case where there are multiple possible state transitions on adjacent vertices. We then prove that if the interaction is exchangeable, then any uniform function which gives a global conserved quantity can be expressed as a sum of local conserved quantities of the interaction. Contrary to our previous article, we do not need to assume that the interaction is irreducibly quantified. This shows that our theory of uniform functions on configuration spaces over infinite graphs with transition structure given by an exchangeable interaction is a natural framework to study general stochastic large scale interacting systems. While some of the ideas in this article are based on our previous article, the article is logically independent and self-contained.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion in conformal field theory with W-symmetry and the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ODE/IM correspondence between two-dimensional $WA_{r}$/$WD_{r}$-type conformal field theories and the higher-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) obtained from the affine Toda field theories associated with $A_r^{(1)}/D_r^{(1)}$-type affine Lie algebras. We calculate the period integrals of the WKB solution to the ODE along the Pochhammer contour, where the WKB expansions correspond to the classical conserved currents of the Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchies. We also compute the integrals of motion for $WA_{r}$($WD_{r}$) algebras on a cylinder. Their eigenvalues on the vacuum state are confirmed to agree with the period integrals up to the sixth order. These results generalize the ODE/IM correspondence to higher-order ODEs and can be used to predict higher-order integrals of motion.</description>

      <title>Integrable system on minimal nilpotent orbit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for every complex simple Lie algebra, the equations of Schubert divisors on the flag variety give a complete integrable system of the minimal nilpotent orbit. The approach is motivated by the integrable system on Coulomb branch. We give explicit computations of these Hamiltonian functions, using Chevalley basis and a so-called Heisenberg algebra basis. For classical Lie algebras we rediscover the lower order terms of the celebrated Gelfand-Zeitlin system. For exceptional types we computed the number of Hamiltonian functions associated to each vertex of Dynkin diagram. They should be regarded as analogs of Gelfand-Zeitlin functions on exceptional type Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Stratified Resistive Tearing Instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive tearing instabilities are common in fluids that are highly electrically conductive and carry strong currents. We determine the effect of stable stratification on the tearing instability under the Boussinesq approximation. Our results generalise previous work that considered only specific parameter regimes, and we show that the length scale of the fastest growing mode depends non-monotonically on the stratification strength. We confirm our analytical results by solving the linearised equations numerically, and we discuss whether the instability could operate in the solar tachocline.</description>

      <title>The $\hbar\to 0$ limit of open quantum systems with general Lindbladians: vanishing noise ensures classicality beyond the Ehrenfest time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum and classical systems evolving under the same formal Hamiltonian $H$ may exhibit dramatically different behavior after the Ehrenfest timescale $t_E \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even as $\hbar \to 0$. Coupling the system to a Markovian environment results in a Lindblad equation for the quantum evolution. Its classical counterpart is given by the Fokker-Planck equation on phase space, which describes Hamiltonian flow with friction and diffusive noise. The quantum and classical evolutions may be compared via the Wigner-Weyl representation. Due to decoherence, they are conjectured to match closely for times far beyond the Ehrenfest timescale as $\hbar \to 0$. We prove a version of this correspondence, bounding the error between the quantum and classical evolutions for any sufficiently regular Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$ and Lindblad functions $L_k(x,p)$. The error is small when the strength of the diffusion $D$ associated to the Lindblad functions satisfies $D \gg \hbar^{4/3}$, in particular allowing vanishing noise in the classical limit. We use a time-dependent semiclassical mixture of variably squeezed Gaussian states evolving by a local harmonic approximation to the Lindblad dynamics. Both the exact quantum trajectory and its classical counterpart can be expressed as perturbations of this semiclassical mixture, with the errors bounded using Duhamel's principle. We present heuristic arguments suggesting the $4/3$ exponent is optimal and defines a boundary in the sense that asymptotically weaker diffusion permits a breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence at the Ehrenfest timescale. Our presentation aims to be comprehensive and accessible to both mathematicians and physicists. In a shorter companion paper, we treat the special case of Hamiltonians of the form $H=p^2/(2m) + V(x)$ and linear Lindblad operators, with explicit bounds that can be applied directly to physical systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Multidimensional Long-Range Random Field Ising Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in a class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting, proposed by two of us, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative approach that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen suggested that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended algebra of the free electromagnetic fields, including infrared singular fields, and the almost radial gauge, both introduced earlier, are postulated for the construction of the quantum electrodynamics in a Hilbert space (no indefinite metric). Both the Dirac and electromagnetic fields are constructed up to the first order (based on the incoming fields) as operators in the Hilbert space, and shown to have physically well interpretable asymptotic behavior in far past and spacelike separations. The Dirac field tends in far past to the free incoming field, carrying its own Coulomb field, but with no 'soft photon dressing'. The spacelike asymptotic limit of the electromagnetic field yields a conserved operator field, which is a sum of contributions of the incoming Coulomb field, and of the low energy limit of the incoming free electromagnetic field. This should agree with the operator field similarly constructed with the use of outgoing fields, which then relates these past and future characteristics. Higher orders are expected not to change this picture, but their construction needs a treatment of the UV question, which has not been undertaken and remains a problem for further investigation.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two $\delta$-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio $3\!:\!1$ in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is \emph{Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz} (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a $\delta$-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The super version of imprimitivity theorem is available now to describe global supersymmetry of systems using the representations of super Lie groups (SLG). This result uses the equivalence between super Harish- Chandra pairs and super Lie groups at the categorigal level and is applicable to super Poincare group and generalizes a smooth SI to super context. We apply the result to build supersymmetric quantum fields. Towards this end, we set up a super fock space of a disjoint union of super Hilbert spaces which is equivalent to super tensoring of boson (even) part symmetrically and that of fermion (odd) part antisymmetrically of the super particle Hilbert space. This leads to a super fock space that is disjoint union of bosonic and fermionic spaces, that is Z2 graded. We derive covariant Weyl operators for light-like fields, with the massless super spinorial multiplet as an illustrative example. First, we build a representation of a light-like little group in terms of Weyl operators. We then use this construction to induce a representation of Poincare group to construct the fields via super version of imprimitivity theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the often underestimated importance of physical dimensions and units in the formal reconstruction of physical theories, focusing on structuralist approaches that use the concept of ``species of structure" as a meta-mathematical tool. Similar approaches also play a role in current philosophical debates on the metaphysical status of physical quantities. Our approach is already contained in an earlier suggestion by T. Tao. It involves the representation of fundamental physical quantities by one-dimensional real ordered vector spaces, while derived quantities are formulated using concepts from linear algebra, e.g., tensor products and dual spaces. As an introduction, the theory of Ohm's law is considered. We then formulate a reconstruction of the calculus of physical dimensions, including Buckingham's $\Pi$-theorem. Furthermore, an application of this method to the Newtonian theory of gravitating systems consisting of point particles is demonstrated, emphasizing the role of the automorphism group and its physical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Spectral estimates of dynamically-defined and amenable operator families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider kernel operators defined by a dynamical system. The Hausdorff distance of spectra is estimated by the Hausdorff distance of subsystems. We prove that the spectrum map is $ \frac{1}{2} $-H\"older continuous provided the group action and kernel are Lipschitz continuous and the group has strict polynomial growth. Also, we prove that the continuity can be improved resulting in the spectrum map being Lipschitz continuous provided the kernel is instead locally-constant. This complements a 1990 result by J.~Avron; P.H.M.v.~Mouche; B.~Simon establishing that one-dimensional discrete quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous potentials, e.g., the Almost Mathieu Operator, exhibit spectral $ \frac{1}{2} $-H\"older continuity. Also, this complements a 2019 result by S.~Beckus; J.~Bellissard; H.~Cornean establishing that $ d $-dimensional discrete subshift Schr\"odinger operators with locally-constant potentials, e.g., the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, exhibit spectral Lipschitz continuity. Our work exposes the connection between the past two results, and the group, e.g., the Heisenberg group, needs not be the integer lattice nor abelian.</description>

      <title>Existence of global weak solutions to quasilinear theory for electrostatic plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasilinear theory has been widely used to describe the resonant particle-wave interaction in plasmas. It is a reduced model which originated from the Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell system in weak turbulence regime under random phase approximation and ergodicity assumptions. The system consists of particles and waves (plasmons) coupled with each other through a resonance condition relating the momentum space and the spectral space. The electrostatic case, i.e. the model originating from Vlasov-Poisson system, is the most fundamental and representative one. In this paper, we prove the existence of global weak solutions to this system modeling electrostatic plasmas in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Generalized Symmetries and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this lecture note, we give a basic introduction to the rapidly developing concepts of generalized symmetries, from the perspectives of both high energy physics and condensed matter physics. In particular, we emphasize on the (invertible) higher-form and higher-group symmetries. For the physical applications, we discuss the geometric engineering of QFTs in string theory and the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in condensed matter physics.
  The lecture note is based on a short course on generalized symmetries, jointly given by Yi-Nan Wang and Qing-Rui Wang in Feb. 2023, which took place at School of Physics, Peking University (https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/18796/).</description>

      <title>Regularized integrals and manifolds with log corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural geometric framework for the study of logarithmically divergent integrals on manifolds with corners and algebraic varieties, using the techniques of logarithmic geometry. Key to the construction is a new notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry itself, introduced by Howell, which allows us to interpret the ubiquitous rule of thumb ``$\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \log \epsilon := 0$'' as the restriction to a submanifold. Via a version of de Rham's theorem with logarithmic divergences, we obtain a functorial characterization of the classical theory of ``regularized integration'': it is the unique way to extend the ordinary integral to the logarithmically divergent context while respecting the basic laws of calculus (change of variables, Fubini's theorem, and Stokes' formula.)</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for a coherent phenomenon of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a general proof that the only static and spherically symmetric, vacuum solutions of the local scale invariant conformally coupled scalar theory of gravity, are conformal to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution. In this context the physical relevance of local scale symmetry is discussed in light of two complementary points of view on conformal transformations understood as either passive or active transformations.</description>

      <title>Spinoptics in a curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study propagation of the high frequency electromagnetic waves in a curved spacetime. We discuss a so call spinoptics approach which generalizes a well known geometric optics approximation and allows one to take into account spin-dependent corrections. A new element proposed in this work is the use of effective action which allows one to derive spinoptics equations. This method is simpler and more transparent than the earlier proposed methods. It is explicitly covariant and can be applied to an arbitrary spacetime background. We also demonstrate how the initial value problem for the high frequency electromagnetiv wave can be soled in the developed spinoptics approximation.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>RBMD: A molecular dynamics package enabling to simulate 10 million all-atom particles in a single graphics processing unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a random-batch molecular dynamics (RBMD) package for fast simulations of particle systems at the nano/micro scale. Different from existing packages, the RBMD uses random batch methods for nonbonded interactions of particle systems. The long-range part of Coulomb interactions is calculated in Fourier space by the random batch Ewald algorithm, which achieves linear complexity and superscalability, surpassing classical lattice-based Ewald methods. For the short-range part, the random batch list algorithm is used to construct neighbor lists, significantly reducing both computational and memory costs. The RBMD is implemented on GPU-CPU heterogeneous architectures, with classical force fields for all-atom systems. Benchmark systems are used to validate accuracy and performance of the package. Comparison with the particle-particle particle-mesh method and the Verlet list method in the LAMMPS package is performed on three different NVIDIA GPUs, demonstrating high efficiency of the RBMD on heterogeneous architectures. Our results also show that the RBMD enables simulations on a single GPU with a CPU core up to 10 million particles. Typically, for systems of one million particles, the RBMD allows simulating all-atom systems with a high efficiency of 8.20 ms per step, demonstrating the attractive feature for running large-scale simulations of practical applications on a desktop machine.</description>

      <title>Homotopy representations of extended holomorphic symmetry in holomorphic twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that holomorphic twists of supersymmetric field theories naturally come with a symmetry $L_\infty$-algebra that nontrivially extends holomorphic symmetry. This symmetry acts on spacetime fields only up to homotopy, and the extension is only visible at the level of higher components of the action. We explicitly compute this for the holomorphic twist of ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, which produces a nontrivial action of a higher $L_\infty$-algebra on (a graded version) of five-dimensional affine space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we describe certain pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators, both of which are exactly-solvable models in quantum mechanics. By coupling the dynamics of a particle moving in a one-dimensional potential to an imaginary-valued gauge field, it is possible to obtain certain pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the original (Hermitian) problem. In particular, it is pointed out that the Swanson oscillator arises as such an extension of the quantum harmonic oscillator. For the pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators, we explicitly solve for the wavefunctions in the position representation and also explore their intertwining relations.</description>
