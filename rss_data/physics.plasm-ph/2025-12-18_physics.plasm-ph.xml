      <title>Permanent magnet optimization of stellarators with coupling from finite permeability and demagnetization effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent magnets provide an attractive path for shaping university-scale stellarator magnetic fields. Previous work has shown that greedy permanent magnet optimization (GPMO) can produce sparse, grid-aligned arrays that match target surfaces with high accuracy under an ideal rigid-remanence model. Here we extend this approach to a greedy permanent magnet optimization with macromagnetic refinement (GPMOmr) by introducing a block-level macromagnetic model that accounts for magnet-magnet and magnet-coil coupling from finite permeability and demagnetizing interactions, and apply it to the published magnet grid from the MUSE stellarator design. Finite-permeability effects produce degree-scale tilts and few-percent magnitude changes in individual magnets and modify the surface-normal field $\mathbf B\cdot\mathbf n$ only at the percent level, yet for a fixed layout they increase the standard squared-flux objective by more than a factor of two. When the same model is embedded in the greedy loop, GPMOmr achieves $f_B$ histories and final errors within a few percent of classical GPMO while producing visibly more nonuniform magnetization patterns. Our formulation provides a fast and practical tool for quantifying and incorporating finite-permeability effects in permanent-magnet stellarator designs, and offers a framework for extending permanent-magnet optimization to higher field strengths and to materials with stronger macromagnetic coupling.</description>

      <title>Effects of Unequal Electron-Ion Plasma Beta on Pressure-Strain Interaction in Turbulent Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common occurrence in weakly collisional space plasmas is the unequal electron-ion temperatures. The pressure-strain interaction provides a mechanism-agnostic pathway for increasing plasma internal energy through spatiotemporally local isotropic compression and volume preserving deformation, yet its behavior under thermal disequilibrium is largely unexplored. We investigate this using five fully kinetic two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of undriven decaying turbulence by varying the initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio. By analyzing the species' internal energy density alongside a decomposition of the pressure-strain term, with a focus on the volume-preserving deformation that contains normal and shear contributions, we quantify how the initial temperature imbalance modifies the channels through which turbulence increases each species' internal energy density. The cumulative pressure-strain interaction tracks the change in internal energy for both electrons and ions, with the total deformation channel of energy conversion dominating. We discover that local changes to electron internal energy density are governed primarily by the shear deformation power density, concentrated in electron-scale current sheets, while the ion shear and normal deformation components cancel, yielding a much smaller net deformation power density that peaks around, rather than within, those electron-scale current structures. We find that the amplitudes and localization of deformation change, but preserve these qualitative trends. Together, these results show how thermal disequilibrium could shape species-dependent turbulent "heating rate", measured via pressure-strain interaction and approximated via only its shear deformation part, and provide a framework for interpreting energy evolution and conversion in space plasmas where unequal species temperature is the norm.</description>

      <title>MHD Simulation Study on Impurity Assimilation Efficiency and Disruption Dynamics during Shattered Pellet Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shattered Pellet Injection (SPI) has become a critical technique for mitigating plasma disruptions in fusion devices, yet optimizing its efficiency demands a proper understanding of the interaction between impurity dynamics and MHD response. We perform 3D nonlinear MHD simulations of SPI-induced disruption in a J-TEXT-like tokamak using the NIMROD code, systematically examining key parameters: fragment velocity and fineness, injection quantity, impurity composition, injection location and multiple injectors, resistivity, and parallel thermal conductivity. We find that slower fragment velocity enhances impurity assimilation and amplifies MHD activity. Finer fragments significantly increase impurity ablation and cooling efficiency. Mixed deuterium-neon pellets effectively elevate electron density without compromising radiative cooling efficiency. Plasma poloidal rotation affects ablation and cooling efficiency, whereas toroidally uniform multi-pellet injection enhances impurity ablation by nearly a factor equal to the number of pellets and lowers radiation asymmetry. Higher plasma parallel thermal conductivity results in higher radiation cooling efficiency in parallel directions, enhances impurity transport, and reduces toroidal peaking factor (TPF) of radiation. Variations in resistivity significantly influence Ohmic heating, impurity deposition and current dynamics after TQ, with higher resistivity leading to stronger magnetic perturbations and more pronounced current spikes. These findings provide physical bases for optimizing SPI schemes in future tokamak devices.</description>

      <title>First implementation of AXUV-based analysis and macro-instability diagnostics on WHAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute extreme ultraviolet (AXUV) diode arrays are widely used in fusion experiments for time-resolved measurements of plasma radiation. We report the first implementation of an AXUV-based analysis framework on the Wisconsin High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM). A single, precisely calibrated 20-channel AXUV assembly measures line-integrated plasma emission with $ 100~\mathrm{kHz}$ temporal resolution and $\sim1~\mathrm{cm}$ spatial accuracy across the mid-plane. The data were processed to obtain plasma's statistical moments, yielding time-resolved measurement of the centroid displacement $\Phi(t)$ and effective radius $R(t)$. From the joint covariance of these quantities, we define a macroscopic instability parameter $\chi(t)$, that quantifies large-scale plasma motion and profile evolution directly from AXUV observables. The parameter $\chi$ serves as a compact indicator of global macroscopic instability, decreasing with increasing end-plate bias and exhibiting strong anti-correlation with diamagnetic flux during confinement transitions. These results demonstrate that a single AXUV array can provide quantitative, real-time assessment of macroscopic plasma instabilities, constituting the first demonstration of such capability in a magnetic mirror plasma. Future extensions to multiple arrays will further enhance spatial coverage and enable full-mode tracking in axisymmetric mirror configurations and related fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Radial electric field and density fluctuations measured by Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase in W7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial profiles of density fluctuations and radial electric field, $E_r$, have been measured using Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase achieved, under different heating power levels and magnetic configurations, along the 2018 W7-X experimental campaign. A pronounced $E_r$-well is measured with local values as high as -40 kV/m in the radial range $\rho \sim 0.7-0.8$ during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase. The maximum $E_r$ intensity scales with both plasma density and Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) power level following a similar trend as the plasma energy content. A good agreement is found when the experimental $E_r$ profiles are compared to simulations carried out using the neoclassical codes DKES and KNOSOS. The density fluctuation level decreases from the plasma edge toward the plasma core and the drop is more pronounced in the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase than in reference gas fuelled plasmas. Besides, in the post-pellet phase, the density fluctuation level is lower in the high iota magnetic configuration than in the standard one. In order to discriminate whether this difference is related to the differences in the plasma profiles or in the stability properties of the two configurations, gyrokinetic simulations have been carried out using the codes \texttt{stella} and EUTERPE. The simulation results point to the plasma profile evolution after the pellet injection and the stabilization effect of the radial electric field profile as the dominant players in the stabilization of the plasma turbulence.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic islands on plasma flow and turbulence in W7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of magnetic islands on plasma flow and turbulence has been experimentally investigated in the stellarator W7-X. Magnetic configurations with the 5/5 magnetic island positioned at the plasma edge, inside the last closed flux surface, are studied. The main diagnostic used in the present work is a V-band Doppler reflectometer that allows the measurement of the perpendicular plasma flow and density fluctuations with good spatial resolution. A characteristic signature of the 5/5 magnetic island is clearly detected in the perpendicular flow profile. The comparison of the experimental flow and the neoclassically driven $E\times B$ flow indicates that the island contribution to the flow is maximum at the island boundaries and close to zero at the island O-point. Besides, a reduction in the density fluctuation level is found nearby the island O-point. The similarities between these observations and those found in other devices and in gyrokinetic simulations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Discussion on the vanishment of solar atmospheric structures during magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection alters the topological connectivity, and magnetic energy is released. However, the length change of the reconnecting structures has rarely been reported. To identify the evolution of the topological structures, we search for reconnection events which should satisfy 3 criteria. (1) Each event displays an explicit X-type configuration, and the configuration consists of two sets of independent atmospheric structures, (2) the reconnection process is clearly observed, and (3) the topological connectivity of the structures can be tracked from at least 5 minutes prior to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection to 5 minutes after the reconnection. In this work, 3 events are selected and studied. During the reconnection moment, the total length of the two topological structures in each event shortens suddenly, and the decrements for events 1--3 are 47 Mm, 3.7 Mm, and 8.2 Mm, respectively, implying that partial structures vanish observationally during magnetic reconnection process. Several possibilities about the vanishment, e.g. the shrinkage of the reconnecting structures due to magnetic tension, the bizarre change in the third dimension, and magnetic field annihilation, have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Characterising injection signatures in Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora using Juno observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete features in Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora have been interpreted as signatures of plasma injections in the middle magnetosphere. There exists some ambiguity whether magnetodisc scattering or high-latitude Alfvenic acceleration best describes the observed properties of these injection signatures, and also to what extent arcs in the outer emission are related to injections. Many injection signatures are the result of the evolution of dawn storms; there is, however, limited evidence that non-dawn-storm injection signatures are sometimes present in the aurora. We use automatic detection of these discrete features, alongside data from Juno-UVS and in-situ measurements by other Juno instruments, to show that scattering likely accounts for most of the electron precipitation associated with injection signatures. Additionally, there is evidence that injection signatures can be classified into two types: dawn-storm and non-dawn-storm. Arc-like features in the outer emission show very similar properties to traditional blob-like injection signatures and may consist of sequences of injection signatures that have broadened into an arc via energy-dependent electron drift.</description>

      <title>Magnetised turbulent plasmas as high-energy particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This proceedings paper reports on the theoretical modelling of particle acceleration in magnetised turbulent plasmas. It briefly reviews some recent findings obtained from fully kinetic numerical simulations of large-amplitude, semi to fully relativistic turbulence. The paper then argues that these findings can be understood within the framework of a ``generalised Fermi'' picture of stochastic acceleration, which it summarises. The dominant contributions to acceleration appear to arise from particle interactions with sharp, dynamic bends of the magnetic field lines and regions of velocity compression. Interestingly, the acceleration rate is spatially inhomogeneous and its probability distribution follows a broken power law extending up to large values. This makes relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence an extreme particle accelerator. Some implications for particle transport and the shape of the particle energy spectrum in the presence of radiative losses and over long timescales are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The role of the exchange-Coulomb potential in two-dimensional electron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantum kinetic theory of two-dimensional electron gases in which exchange is treated self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level and enters as a nonlocal, momentum-dependent field in phase space. By starting from the Coulomb Hamiltonian, we derive a Hartree-Fock-Wigner equation for the electronic Wigner function and obtain a closed fluid model with exchange-corrected pressure, force, and current. For a single layer, we show that exchange renormalizes the Fermi velocity and can drive a long-wavelength plasmonic instability at low densities. In coupled layers, the same framework predicts acoustic-optical mode coupling, and an instability forming long-lived charge-imbalance patterns that are not predicted by classical Vlasov and Boltzmann models. Finally, we apply the kinetic model to the Coulomb drag problem and show how exchange substantially enhances the drag resistivity in dilute GaAs double wells, quantitatively matching experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Energy exchange between electrons and ions driven by ITG-TEM turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the energy exchange between electrons and ions in ITG TEM turbulence is investigated using gyrokinetic simulations. The energy exchange in TEM turbulence is primarily composed of the cooling of electrons associated with perpendicular drift and the heating of ions moving parallel to magnetic field lines. TEM turbulence facilitates energy transfer from electrons to ions, which is opposite to the direction observed in ITG turbulence. In mixed ITG TEM turbulence, the relative magnitudes of parallel heating and perpendicular cooling for each species determine the overall direction and magnitude of energy exchange. From the viewpoint of entropy balance, it is further confirmed that energy flows from the species with larger entropy production, caused by particle and heat fluxes, to the other species in ITG TEM turbulence. The predictability of turbulent energy exchange in ITG-TEM turbulence by the quasilinear model is examined. In addition, an alternative method based on the correlation between energy flux and energy exchange is developed, and its validity is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Physics of the Plasma Liner Experiment: A Multi-dimensional Study with FLASH, OSIRIS, and HELIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Plasma Liner Experiment (PLX) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is a platform that seeks to achieve fusion via the Plasma-Jet-Driven Magneto-Inertial Fusion (PJMIF) concept. The experiment utilizes a constellation of plasma guns to generate fusion-relevant conditions and consists of three main phases: (1) target formation, in which up to four plasma guns shoot magnetized hydrogen or deuterium-tritium jets to form a quasi-spherical target, (2) liner formation, in which a 36 guns fire high-atomic-number (e.g., xenon) jets to form a liner shell, and (3) target compression, in which the formed liner implodes the pre-formed target. Each phase of the PLX operates in different plasma regimes, with different physics at play, thus each phase must be simulated separately with appropriate codes. In this study we highlight 1-, 2-, and 3-D simulation results of all three phases using the FLASH, OSIRIS, and HELIOS codes. Some of the key physical processes involved include shock dynamics, kinetic effects, anisotropic thermal conduction, resistive magnetic diffusion, radiation transport, and magnetized jet dynamics. The simulations show that the PLX can form a preheated ($\sim$40 eV), magnetized (electron Hall parameter $&gt;$1) target plasma, and a quasi-collisional liner shell, which can subsequently compress the target to fusion-relevant conditions, reaching temperatures in excess of 1 keV.</description>

      <title>Large Errors in Kinetic Temperature Measurements Using Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on random errors in kinetic temperature measurements due to finite spatial resolution in particle tracking velocimetry. Using simulated data, we isolate the error caused by finite spatial resolution from other sources of uncertainty, such as particle acceleration and particle mismatch. A sample of particle velocities is generated from a Maxwellian distribution at a prescribed kinetic temperature. Particle positions are assigned randomly and discretized to match a prescribed spatial resolution. Velocities are reconstructed using the two-frame tracking method, and the resulting kinetic temperature is calculated and compared to the true kinetic temperature. Results show that under typical experimental conditions, the uncertainty in particle positions propagates into large errors in the velocity distribution and the measured kinetic temperature. We find that this might introduce errors ranging from tens of percent at high kinetic temperatures ($\sim 10$~eV) to thousands of percent at low temperatures ($\sim 0.1$~eV).</description>
