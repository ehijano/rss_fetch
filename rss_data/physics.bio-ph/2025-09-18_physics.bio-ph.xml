      <title>An immuno-Infrared Sensor detects preclinical Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease by misfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The immuno-infrared sensor detects target proteins in solution. Exemplary, the initial misfolding of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in blood is measured, enabling early risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease in the preclinical stage. Antibodies concentrate the target protein on the functionalized attenuated total reflection crystal surface. A quantum cascade laser is used to measure the amide I band, which indicates the secondary structure distribution of Abeta in blood as a biomarker.</description>

      <title>A generative model of function growth explains hidden self-similarities across biological and social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.</description>

      <title>TICA-Based Free Energy Matching for Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insight into biomolecular systems but are often limited by high computational costs required to access long timescales. Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.</description>

      <title>Rotational dynamics of bound pairs of bacteria-induced membrane tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experiments demonstrating tube formation in giant unilamellar vesicles that are suspended in a bath of swimming E. coli bacteria. We chose the lipids such that the bacteria have no adhereing interaction with the membrane. The tubes are generated by the pushing force exerted by the bacteria on the membrane of the vesicles. Once generated, the bacteria are confined within the tubes, resulting in long-lived tubes that protrude into the vesicle. We show that such tubes interact to form stable bound pairs that orbit each other. We speculate that the tubes are maintained by the persistent pushing force generated by the bacterium, and the rotating pairs are stabilized by a combination of curvature mediated interaction and vorticity generated in the membrane by the rotation of the flagella.</description>

      <title>Thickness Dependence and Fundamental Limitations for Ion Permeation in Nanoscale Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attraction and Hindered Diffusion Govern First-passage Times of Swimming Microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of microorganisms in their natural habitat is strongly influenced by their propulsion mechanisms, geometrical constraints, and random fluctuations. Here, we study numerically the first-passage-time (FPT) statistics of microswimmers, modeled as force-dipoles, to reach a no-slip wall. Our results demonstrate that hindered diffusion near the wall can increase the median FPT by orders of magnitude compared to "dry" agents, while the intricate interplay of active motion and hydrodynamic attraction speeds up the arrival at large P\'eclet numbers (measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion). Strikingly, it leads to a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the dipole strength, where pushers reach the wall significantly faster than pullers. The latter become slower at an intermediate dipole strength and are more sensitive to their initial orientation, displaying a highly anisotropic behavior.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence-detected Wavepacket Interferometry reveals time-varying Exciton Relaxation Pathways in single Light-Harvesting Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photosynthesis relies on efficient energy relaxation within the excited-state manifold of pigment-protein complexes. Since the protein scaffold is rather flexible, the resulting energetic and structural disorder gives rise to a complex excited-state energy level structure that fluctuates on all time scales. Although the impact of such fluctuations on relaxation processes is known, the precise exciton states involved in relaxation as well as the nature of the vibrational modes driving relaxation are under debate. Here single pigment-protein complexes from a photosynthetic purple bacterium are excited with two identical ultrashort phase-locked pulses producing two exciton wave packets that can interfere. This leads to a modulation of the emission intensity as a function of the delay time between the pulses that fades out within about 100 fs due to fluctuating environments on those time scales. For several single complexes we find variations of the interference patterns on time scale of several 10 s that reveal fluctuations in the energy relaxation pathways towards the lowest-energy exciton states. This relaxation is driven by temporal variations in the coupling between electronic excitations and low-frequency vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies for navigation in stochastic settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When navigating complex environments, animals often combine multiple strategies to mitigate the effects of external disturbances. These modalities often correspond to different sources of information, leading to speed-accuracy trade-offs. Inspired by the intermittent reorientation strategy seen in the behavior of the dung beetle, we consider the problem of the navigation strategy of a correlated random walker moving in two dimensions. We assume that the heading of the walker can be reoriented to the preferred direction by paying a fixed cost as it tries to maximize its total displacement in a fixed direction. Using optimal control theory, we derive analytically and confirm numerically the strategy that maximizes the walker's speed, and show that the average time between reorientations scales inversely with the magnitude of the environmental noise. We then extend our framework to describe execution errors and sensory acquisition noise. As a result, we provide a range of testable predictions and suggest new experimental directions. Our approach may be amenable to other navigation problems involving multiple sensory modalities that require switching between egocentric and geocentric strategies.</description>

      <title>Sensing environmental physical interaction to traverse cluttered obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-standing, dominant approach to robotic obstacle negotiation relies on mapping environmental geometry to avoid obstacles. However, this approach does not allow for traversal of cluttered obstacles, hindering applications such as search and rescue operations through earthquake rubble and exploration across lunar and Martian rocks. To overcome this challenge, robots must further sense and utilize environmental physical interactions to control themselves to traverse obstacles. Recently, a physics-based approach has been established towards this vision. Self-propelled robots interacting with obstacles results in a potential energy landscape. On this landscape, to traverse obstacles, a robot must escape from certain landscape basins that attract it into failure modes, to reach other basins that lead to successful modes. Thus, sensing the potential energy landscape is crucial. Here, we developed new methods and performed systematic experiments to demonstrate that the potential energy landscape can be estimated by sensing environmental physical interaction. We developed a minimalistic robot capable of sensing obstacle contact forces and torques for systematic experiments over a wide range of parameter space. Surprisingly, although these forces and torques are not fully conservative, they match the potential energy landscape gradients that are conservative forces and torques, enabling an accurate estimation of the potential energy landscape. Additionally, a bio-inspired strategy further enhanced estimation accuracy. Our results provided a foundation for further refining these methods for use in free-locomoting robots. Our study is a key step in establishing a new physics-based approach for robots to traverse clustered obstacles to advance their mobility in complex, real-world environments.</description>
