      <title>Symmetry quantification and segmentation in STEM imaging through Zernike moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method using Zernike moments for quantifying rotational and reflectional symmetries in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, aimed at improving structural analysis of materials at the atomic scale. This technique is effective against common imaging noises and is potentially suited for low-dose imaging and identifying quantum defects. We showcase its utility in the unsupervised segmentation of polytypes in a twisted bilayer TaS$_2$, enabling accurate differentiation of structural phases and monitoring transitions caused by electron beam effects. This approach enhances the analysis of structural variations in crystalline materials, marking a notable advancement in the characterization of structures in materials science.</description>

      <title>Incorporating precipitation-related effects on plastic anisotropy of age-hardenable aluminium alloys into crystal plasticity constitutive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal plasticity finite element simulations are frequently employed to predict the plastic anisotropy of polycrystalline metals based on their crystallographic texture. However, precipitation in age-hardenable aluminium alloys is known to affect the texture-induced plastic anisotropy. A new modelling approach that incorporates this effect into crystal plasticity constitutive models is presented to address this issue. The approach is based on the hypothesis that precipitation occurs in a global preferred direction, resulting in direction-dependent hardening behaviour for the slip systems. The direction dependency is implemented into a conventional crystal plasticity constitutive model by modification of the hardening law using only one additional parameter. To demonstrate the applicability of the new modelling approach, it is applied to an AA6014-T4 age-hardenable aluminium alloy and compared against the current state-of-the-art crystal plasticity modelling approach, taking only the crystallographic texture into account. The results demonstrate that the predicted accuracy of the plastic anisotropy for the AA6014-T4 aluminium alloy studied is significantly improved by the proposed new modelling approach for incorporating precipitation-related effects.</description>

      <title>Agarose Derived Carbon Based Nanocomposite for Hydrogen Storage at Near-Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocomposites comprising of high surface area adsorption materials and nanosized transition metals have emerged as a promising strategy for hydrogen storage application due to their inherent ability to store atomic and molecular forms of hydrogen by invoking mechanisms like physisorption and spillover mechanism or Kubas interaction. The potential use of these materials for both transport and stationary applications depends on reaching the ultimate storage capacity and scalability. In addition to achieving good hydrogen storage capacity, it is also vital to explore novel and efficient synthesis routes to control the microstructure. Herein, a direct and simple thermal decomposition technique is reported to synthesize carbon-based nanocomposites, where nickel nanoparticles are dispersed in a porous carbon matrix. The structure, morphology, composition and nature of bonding in the samples were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Sorption-desorption isotherms were used to study the hydrogen storage capacity of the nanocomposites at a moderate H2 pressure of 20 bar. Among the various nanocomposites examined, the best obtained storage capacity was 0.73 wt.% (against 0.11 wt.% for pure carbon sample) at 298 K with reversible cyclability. It is shown that the uniform dispersion of catalytic nanoparticles along with a high surface area carbon matrix helps in the enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity by a factor of 6.5 times over pure carbon.</description>

      <title>The structure of Ferroelectric BaBiO$_3$/BaTiO$_3$ Interfaces grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the lattice structure of heterostructures comprising of ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) thin films and BaBiO$_3$ (BBO), the insulating parent-compound of the high Tc superconductor. Motivated by theoretical predictions of exotic phenomena in BBO-based heterostructures including interfacial conductivity, superconductivity and topologically-protected states, we synthesize BTO/BBO heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy and characterize their structural properties by in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction and ex-situ high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and piezoforce microscopy. For heterostructures with 4 uc BBO layers, reciprocal space maps indicate strain relaxation relative to the SrTiO$_3$ substrate. We observe a strong tetragonal distortion for heterostructures with 2 unit cells BBO coherently strained to the BTO layers. Raman spectroscopy measurements indicate a suppression of the breathing mode distortion associated with the charge density wave in bulk BBO. The ferroelectric properties of the system are confirmed by piezoforce microscopy measurements. The coupling between the ferroelectric polarization and the electronic states in BBO may potentially serve as a starting point for tunable electrostatic doping to realize the novel predicted states in the atomically-thin BBO layers.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for damage mechanics models using the bootstrap method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the uncertainty of the L\"ammer model of damage evolution when fitted to (noisy) observations of damage evolution in cyclic fatigue experiments with and without dwell time. We therefore develop a bootstrap method by sampling over blocks of load cycles in the experiments in order to quantify the uncertainty in the material parameters of the L\"ammer damage evolution equation. We first develop a resilient optimization algorithm for parameter identification based on numerical solutions of damage evolution. The uncertainty is quantified on three levels: distribution of parameters of the L\"ammer model, confidence bands for the solutions of damage evolution, and distributions of failure times. The method is tested on several data sets, committing considerable high-performance computing resources to the task.</description>

      <title>Near IR bandgap semiconductive 2D conjugated metal-organic framework with rhombic lattice and high mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional conjugated metal-organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) are emerging as a unique class of 2D electronic materials. However, intrinsically semiconducting 2D c-MOFs with gaps in the Vis-NIR and high charge carrier mobility have been rare. Most of the reported semiconducting 2D c-MOFs are metallic (i.e. gapless), which limits their use in applications where larger band gaps are needed for logic devices. Herein, we design a new D2h-geometric ligand, 2,3,6,7,11,12,15,16-octahydroxyphenanthro(9,10b)triphenylene (OHPTP), and synthesize the first example of a 2D c-MOF single crystal (OHPTP-Cu) with a rhombohedral pore geometry after coordination with copper. The continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) analysis unveils the orthorhombic crystal structure at the atomic level with a unique AB layer stacking. The resultant Cu2(OHPTP) is a p-type semiconductor with an indirect band gap of about 0.50 eV and exhibits high electrical conductivity of 0.10 S cm-1 and high charge carrier mobility of 10.0 cm2V-1s-1. Density-functional theory calculations underline the predominant role of the out-of-plane charge transport in this semiquinone-based 2D c-MOFs.</description>

      <title>High capacity NbS2-based anodes for Li-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the lithium capacity of the 2H phase of niobium sulphide (NbS2) using density functional theory calculations and experiments. Theoretically, this material is found to allow the intercalation of a double layer of Li in between each NbS2 layer when in equilibrium with metal Li. The resulting specific capacity (340.8 mAh/g for the pristine material, 681.6 mAh/g for oxidized material) can reach more than double the specific capacity of graphite anodes. The presence of various defects leads to an even higher capacity with a partially reversible conversion of the material, indicating that the performance of the anodes is robust with respect to the presence of defects. Experiments in battery prototypes with NbS2-based anodes find a first specific capacity of about 1,130 mAh/g, exceeding the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>SP-STM study of the multi-Q phases in GdRu2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two stable surfaces of GdRu2Si2 are studied using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM). Depending on the applied magnetic field different magnetic phases have been found and the presented measurements are in agreement with the respective previously proposed multi-Q spin textures. In particular the multi-Q nature of the zero magnetic field state, for which previous experiments could not rule out the coexistence of single-Q states, can be confirmed by our spin-resolved measurements on the Si-terminated surface. The surfaces of GdRu2Si2 exhibit strong magnetism-induced modulations of the spin-averaged density of states. We find that while the magnetic contribution to the tunnel signal can be clearly identified for the Si-terminated surface this proves to be much more difficult for the Gd-terminated surface. However, the magnetic field dependent spatial modulations on the Gd-terminated surface demonstrate that additional magnetic phase transitions occur for the surface layer compared to those identified for bulk GdRu2Si2 and possible spin textures are presented.</description>

      <title>Structural, electronic, and optical properties of 6H-SiC layers synthesized by implantation of carbon ions into silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic studies of the gradual fabrication by means of carbon ion-implantation of high-quality 6H-SiC layers on silicon surfaces have been carried out. The fluence of carbon ions varied from 5*10^15 cm-2 to 10^17 cm-2. Results of first-principle calculations, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate the amorphization of silicon substrate without any tendency to the segregation of carbon in the samples synthesized at low fluencies. The formation of a SiO2-like structure at this stage was also detected. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), XRD, and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that an increase in carbon content at 10^17 cm-2 fluence leads to the growth of 6H-SiC films on the surface of the amorphous silicon substrate. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) data obtained also demonstrates the decreasing of surface roughens after the formation of SiC film. XPS and Raman spectra suggest that excessive carbon content leaves the SiC matrix via the formation of an insignificant amount of partially oxidized carbon nanostructures. Optical measurements also support the claim of high-quality 6H-SiC film formation in the samples synthesized at 10^17 cm-2 fluence and demonstrate the absence of any detectable contribution of nanostructures formed from excessive carbon on the optical properties of the material under study.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic order of topological orbital moments in atomic-scale skyrmion lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological orbital moments can arise in non-coplanar spin structures even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and a net topological orbital magnetization occurs for the triple-Q state and for isolated skyrmions. For atomic-scale skyrmion lattices, a significant effect can also be expected, however, no studies have been reported yet. Here, we observe via spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy a non-coplanar atomic-scale spin structure with a nearly square magnetic unit cell for a pseudomorphic Fe monolayer on three atomic Ir layers on the Re(0001) surface. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations we consider different skyrmionic lattices to find the magnetic ground state. By mapping the DFT total energies to an atomistic spin model we demonstrate that these spin textures are stabilized by the interplay of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and four-spin interactions. We evaluate the emerging phenomena of the different non-coplanar magnetic states and find significant local topological orbital moments oriented perpendicular to the surface, which order in an antiferromagnetic fashion.</description>

      <title>Raman analysis of the dehydrogenation process of hydrogenated monolayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating defects in graphene by hydrogenation, either to achieve hydrogen chemisorption or partial etching, is a way to open an electronic band gap in graphene. Understanding the range of stability conditions of partially etched or hydrogenated graphene is crucial for application, as processing conditions (e.g. temperature) and quality control (characterization) conditions may result in modifying the material through partial or full dehydrogenation, and subsequent alteration of its electronic properties. This work reports a study of various dehydrogenation conditions of hydrogenated or hydrogen-etched monolayer graphene (1LG), either free-standing or supported by an interferential (SiO2/Si) substrate, using incremental annealing under nitrogen atmosphere up to 400 {\textdegree}C. Materials were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Indeed, it has been known since 2012 that the intensity ratio of two Raman bands activated by double resonance, D over D' (ID/ID') can be used to identify the type of defects in defective graphene. It is shown that hydrogenated 1LG, characterized by a large ID/ID' ratio (~9-15), is stable provided annealing remains below 300 {\textdegree}C. On the other hand, defective 1LG resulting from hydrogen etching remains stable up to 400 {\textdegree}C, whether the 1LG is hydrogenated on one side or both sides, while a modification in the type and proportions of defects is likely. Experimental conditions for the safe use of Raman spectroscopy, otherwise able to induce specimen overheating because of the laser energy and power, are also determined and discussed.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved electronic structures and strong electronic correlations in graphene-like nitride superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although transition-metal nitrides have been widely applied for several decades, experimental investigations of their high-resolution electronic band structures are rare due to the lack of high-quality single-crystalline samples. Here, we report on the first momentum-resolved electronic band structures of titanium nitride (TiN) films, a remarkable nitride superconductor. The measurements of crystal structures and electrical transport properties confirmed the high quality of these films. More importantly, with a combination of high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations, the extracted Coulomb interaction strength of TiN films can be as large as 8.5 eV, whereas resonant photoemission spectroscopy yields a value of 6.26 eV. These large values of Coulomb interaction strength indicate that superconducting TiN is a strongly correlated system. Our results uncover the unexpected electronic correlations in transition-metal nitrides, potentially providing a perspective not only to understand their emergent quantum states but also to develop their applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Imaging, counting, and positioning single interstitial atoms in solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstitial atoms are ubiquitous in solids and they are widely incorporated into materials to tune their lattice structure, electronic transportation, and mechanical properties. Because the distribution of interstitial atoms in matrix materials is usually disordered and most of them are light atoms with weak scattering ability, it remains a challenge to directly image single interstitial atoms and measure their geometrical positions. In this work, direct imaging and measuring of single interstitial atoms have been realized with adaptive-propagator ptychography. The measurement of their three-dimensional coordinates enables quantitative analysis of the pair distribution function of the interstitial atoms and reveals the anisotropic occupation of oxygen in the interstitial sites in titanium. The current work paves the way for the determination of interstitial atoms in materials, and for the correlation between the atomic-scale behavior of interstitial atoms and the physical properties of materials.</description>

      <title>Tunable magnetism of Boron Imidazolate-based Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MMOFs), where magnetic metal nodes are connected into a crystal structure by organic linkers, have a potential to host exotic magnetic states. We present a study of bulk magnetic properties of four metal-organic frameworks with boron imidazolate linkers, Zn-BIF, Cu-BIF, Co-BIF, and Ni-BIF, displaying a variety of lattice structures and nontrivial magnetic behaviors. While non-magnetic Zn-BIF provides an offset of magnetic response, magnetic susceptibility measurements of the other three magnetic materials demonstrate the presence of weak magnetic interactions in these MOFs, which differ between materials by sign and size. Cu-MOF, where magnetic nodes are connected into octahedral cages, shows simple paramagnetic behavior. Triangular lattice Co-MOF shows antiferromagnetic interactions on the order of 1 K, and a spin-crossover-like effect in magnetic susceptibility due to thermal depopulation of excited crystal electric field levels. Magnetic properties of Ni-BIF suggest sizable ferromagnetic interactions. Using DC/AC susceptibility and variable-field DC magnetization, we detect behavior that resembles that of superparamagnetic single-magnetic-domain nanoparticles, but with particle sizes on the scale of the unit cell, and discuss possible microscopic origins of this behavior. This work demonstrates the variety of magnetic properties that are possible with a single organic ligand, and establishes the low energy scale of magnetic interactions through superexchange in boron imidazolate frameworks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In alignment with the increasing demand for larger storage capacity and longer data retention, electrical control of magnetic anisotropy has been a research focus in the realm of spintronics. Typically, magnetic anisotropy is determined by grain dimensionality, which is set during the fabrication of magnetic thin films. Despite the intrinsic correlation between magnetic anisotropy and grain dimensionality, there is a lack of experimental evidence for electrically controlling grain dimensionality, thereby impeding the efficiency of magnetic anisotropy modulation. Here, we demonstrate an electric field control of grain dimensionality and prove it as the active mechanism for tuning interfacial magnetism. The reduction in grain dimensionality is associated with a transition from ferromagnetic to superparamagnetic behavior. We achieve a non-volatile and reversible modulation of the coercivity in both the ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic regimes. Subsequent electrical and elemental analysis confirms the variation in grain dimensionality upon the application of gate voltages, revealing a transition from a multidomain to a single-domain state accompanied by a reduction in grain dimensionality. Furthermore, we exploit the influence of grain dimensionality on domain wall motion, extending its applicability to multilevel magnetic memory and synaptic devices. Our results provide a strategy for tuning interfacial magnetism through grain size engineering for advancements in high-performance spintronics.</description>

      <title>Understanding and exploiting interfacial interactions between phosphonic acid functional groups and co-evaporated perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial engineering has fueled recent development of p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PSCs), with self-assembled monolayer-based hole-transport layers (SAM-HTLs) enabling almost lossless contacts for solution-processed PSCs, resulting in the highest achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) to date. Substrate interfaces are particularly crucial for the growth and quality of co-evaporated PSCs. However, adoption of SAM-HTLs for co-evaporated perovskite absorbers is complicated by the underexplored interaction of such perovskites with phosphonic acid functional groups. In this work, we highlight how exposed phosphonic acid functional groups impact the initial phase and final bulk crystal structures of co-evaporated perovskites and their resultant PCE. The explored surface interaction is mediated by hydrogen bonding with interfacial iodine, leading to increased formamidinium iodide adsorption, persistent changes in perovskite structure, and stabilization of bulk {\alpha}-FAPbI3, hypothesized as being due to kinetic trapping. Our results highlight the potential of exploiting substrates to increase control of co-evaporated perovskite growth.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrated the analogy between Economics and Gauge Theory of Plasticity and used it to describe the relationship between money supply and inflation at the economic market. The received equations of economical dynamics in phase space are similar to the plasticity equations and economic variables - choice, competition and profit correspond to the state of the market with inflation. We described the meaning of equations and the role of its variables in the stabilization mechanism of the market with inflation. The equation of market equilibrium including the Profit turnover, time changes of competition, capital and choice was discussed in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By explicit microscopic construction involving a mapping to a quantum vertex model subject to the `ice rule,' we show that an electronically `trivial' band insulator with suitable vibrational (phonon) degrees of freedom can host a ``resonating valence-bond'' state - a quantum phase with emergent gauge fields. This novel type of band insulator is identifiable by the existence of emergent gapless `photon' modes and deconfined excitations, the latter of which carry non-quantized mobile charges. We suggest that such phases may exist in the quantum regimes of various nearly ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Resistance Distribution of Decoherent Quantum Hall-Superconductor Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission, of a decoherent quantum Hall-superconductor edge, with the decoherence coming from metallic puddles along the edge. Such metallic puddles may originate from magnetic vortex cores or other superconductivity suppressing perturbations. In contrast to the distribution of a coherent edge which is peaked away from zero charge transmission, we show analytically and numerically that the distribution of a decoherent edge with metallic puddles is always peaked at zero charge transmission, which serves as a probe of coherence of superconducting chiral edge states. We further show that the distribution width decays exponentially in magnetic field and temperature. Our theoretical decoherent distribution agrees well with the recent experimental observation in graphene with superconducting proximity.</description>

      <title>Molecular Structure and Rotational Dynamics in the Acetonitrile:Acetylene (1:2) Plastic Co-Crystal at Titan Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface of Saturn's moon Titan is coated with small molecule organic solids termed cryominerals. Cryominerals play an analogous role to minerals on Earth in Titan's surface geology and geochemistry. To develop a predictive understanding of Titan's surface geochemistry, we need to characterize the structure and dynamics of cryominerals at the molecular scale. We use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the structure and dynamics of the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) co-crystal at Titan surface conditions. We suggest that acetonitrile:acetylene is in a plastic phase, in which acetonitrile molecules are dynamically disordered about the N-C-C axis on sub-picosecond timescales, and that this rotational, plastic disorder persists at least to temperatures of 30 K. We anticipate that many cryominerals may have plastic phases at or near Titan surface conditions, and understanding this disorder will be crucial to predicting chemistry on Titan's surface.</description>

      <title>Exchange Splitting Mechanism of Negative Magnetoresistance in Layered Antiferromagnetic Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with AFM-type ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe$_2$As$_2$, EuSn$_2$As$_2$, EuSn$_2$P$_2$, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about $\delta\rho/\rho \sim 4-6\%$ up to the spin-polarization field. Despite the fact that this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. In this paper we propose a novel theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that does not imply either topological origin of the materials, surface roughness, their potential defect structure, or electron-magnon scattering. We believe, the proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is applicable to a wide class of the layered AFM- ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.</description>

      <title>Error-Free and Current-Driven Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Domain Wall Memory Enabled by Channel Meandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new type of multi-bit and energy-efficient magnetic memory based on current-driven, field-free, and highly controlled domain wall motion. A meandering domain wall channel with precisely interspersed pinning regions provides the multi-bit capability of a magnetic tunnel junction. The magnetic free layer of the memory device has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, so that spin-orbit torques induce efficient domain wall motion. Using micromagnetic simulations, we find two pinning mechanisms that lead to different cell designs: two-way switching and four-way switching. The memory cell design choices and the physics behind these pinning mechanisms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we show that switching reliability and speed may be significantly improved by replacing the ferromagnetic free layer with a synthetic antiferromagnetic layer. Switching behavior and material choices will be discussed for the two implementations.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetic multiband Hall effect in Ising antiferromagnet ErGa$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustrated rare-earth-based intermetallics provide a promising platform for emergent magnetotransport properties through exchange coupling between conduction electrons and localized rare-earth magnetic moments. Metamagnetism, the abrupt change of magnetization under an external magnetic field, is a signature of first-order magnetic phase transitions; recently, metamagnetic transitions in frustrated rare earths intermetallics have attracted interest for their accompanying nontrivial spin structures (e.g. skyrmions) and associated non-linear and topological Hall effects. Here, we present metamagnetism-induced Hall anomalies in single-crystalline ErGa$_2$, which recalls features arising from the topological Hall effect but wherein the strong Ising type anisotropy of Er moments prohibit noncoplanar spin structures. We show that the observed anomalies are neither due to anomalous Hall effect nor topological Hall effect, instead, can be accounted for via 4f-5d interactions which produce a band-dependent mobility modulation. This leads to a pronounced multiband Hall response across the magnetization process -- a metamagnetic multiband Hall effect that resembles a topological-Hall-like response but without nontrivial origins. The present findings may be of general relevance in itinerant metamagnetic systems regardless of coplanar/non-coplanar nature of spins and are important for the accurate identification of Hall signals due to emergent magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators have been studied intensively over the last decades. Among these materials, three-dimensional (3D) zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe$_5$) stands out as one of the most intriguing for both theoretical and experimental studies because of its diverse range of distinct topological phases. In this work, we employ density functional theory to study the electronic structure and quantum oscillations exhibited by various topological phases of 3D bulk ZrTe$_5$. We have discovered that by analyzing combined patterns in band structures, Fermi surfaces, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations we can determine the corresponding topological phase without relying on the conventional calculation of topological invariants or boundary state contributions. This approach facilitates the identification of topological phases in ZrTe$_5$ directly from experimental quantum oscillation measurements. Using this method, we have analyzed the entire process of topological phase transition, revealing changes in the topology of the Fermi pockets and validating the shapes deduced from the experimental data for the topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the various chirality measures most widely used in the literature to quantify chiral symmetry in extended solids, i.e., the continuous chirality measure, the Hausdorff distance, and the angular momentum. By studying these functions in an algebraically tractable case, we can evaluate their strengths and weaknesses when applied to more complex crystals. Going beyond those classical calculations, we propose a new method to quantify the handedness of a crystal based on a pseudoscalar function, i.e., the helicity. This quantity, borrowed from hydrodynamics, can be computed from the eigenvector carrying the system from the high-symmetry non-chiral phase to the low-symmetry chiral phase. Different model systems like K$_3$NiO$_2$, CsCuCl$_3$ and MgTi$_2$O$_4$ are used as test cases where we show the superior interest of using helicity to quantify chirality together with the handedness distinction.</description>

Abstract: The coupling of electrons to phonons (electron-phonon coupling) is crucial for the existence of various phases of matter, in particular superconductivity and density waves. Here, we devise a theory that incorporates the quantum geometry of the electron bands into the electron-phonon coupling, demonstrating the crucial contributions of the Fubini-Study metric or its orbital selective version to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant. We apply the theory to two materials, graphene and MgB$_2$ where the geometric contributions account for approximately 50\% and 90\% of the total electron-phonon coupling constant, respectively. The quantum geometric contributions in the two systems are further bounded from below by topological contributions. Our results suggest that the nontrivial electron band geometry/topology might favor superconductivity with relatively high critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of scalable and energy-efficient neuromorphic devices, recent research has unveiled a novel category of spiking oscillators, termed "thermal neuristors". These devices function via thermal interactions among neighboring vanadium dioxide resistive memories, emulating biological neuronal behavior. Here, we show that the collective dynamical behavior of networks of these neurons showcases a rich phase structure, tunable by adjusting the thermal coupling and input voltage. Notably, we identify phases exhibiting long-range order that, however, does not arise from criticality, but rather from the time non-local response of the system. In addition, we show that these thermal neuristor arrays achieve high accuracy in image recognition and time series prediction through reservoir computing, without leveraging long-range order. Our findings highlight a crucial aspect of neuromorphic computing with possible implications on the functioning of the brain: criticality may not be necessary for the efficient performance of neuromorphic systems in certain computational tasks.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetism and anomalous magnetotransport properties in rare-earth-based polar semimetals $R$AuGe ($R =$ Dy, Ho, and Gd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetic, magnetoelastic, and magnetotransport properties of single crystals of polar magnets $R$AuGe ($R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd), grown by Au-Ge self-flux. Magnetization and magnetostriction measurements reveal multi-step metamagnetic transitions for the $c$-axis magnetic field ($H\parallel c$) for DyAuGe and HoAuGe, suggesting magnetic frustration in the triangular lattice of $R$ ions. The magnetic phase diagrams have clarified a close connection between the magnetoelastic property and the emergence of the intermediate metamagentic phase. The magnetic-field dependence of the resistivity and Hall resistivity reveal the semimetallic transport dominated by hole-type carriers, consistent with the behavior in a nonmagnetic analogue YAuGe. We also identify a signature of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) proportional to the field-induced magnetization in $R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd. GdAuGe shows magnetic and transport behavior as reported in a previous study using Bi-flux grown single crystals, while the self-flux grown crystal shows larger magnetoresistance ($\sim$ 345\%, at 1.8 K and 9 T) due to higher hole-type carrier mobility ($\sim$ 6400 cm$^2$/Vs). Using the two-band model analysis considering the mobility change during the magnetization process, we extract the anomalous Hall conductivity: $\sim 1200$ S/cm and $\sim 530$ S/cm for $R=$ Dy and Ho, respectively, at 1.8 K with 9 T for $H\parallel c$. The magnitude of conductivity suggests a contribution of intrinsic origin, possibly related to the Berry curvature in the electron bands induced by the time-reversal symmetry breaking and the polar lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncompensated non-equilibrium orbital magnetization may arise at sample edges in the presence of charge current. The value of the effect scales as the product of the current density and the electron mean free path without any additional smallness. This non-relativistic phenomenon originates in a lack of inversion symmetry of the electron wave functions in a vicinity of sample interfaces. In a conducting layer, where $z$ direction is chosen perpendicular to the surface, and the current flows in $x$ direction, the non-equilibrium orbital magnetization points in $y$ direction. In a top-bottom symmetric layer, the orbital magnetization has an opposite sign near the top and bottom interfaces thus mimicking the symmetry of the spin-Hall effect but can exceed the latter by orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>
