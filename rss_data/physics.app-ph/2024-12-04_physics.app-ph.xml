      <title>Dry Transfer Based on PMMA and Thermal Release Tape for Heterogeneous Integration of 2D-TMDC Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable and scalable transfer of 2D-TMDCs (two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides) from the growth substrate to a target substrate with high reproducibility and yield is a crucial step for device integration. In this work, we have introduced a scalable dry-transfer approach for 2D-TMDCs grown by MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition) on sapphire. Transfer to a silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO$_2$) substrate is performed using PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) and TRT (thermal release tape) as sacrificial layer and carrier, respectively. Our proposed method ensures a reproducible peel-off from the growth substrate and better preservation of the 2D-TMDC during PMMA removal in solvent, without compromising its adhesion to the target substrate. A comprehensive comparison between the dry method introduced in this work and a standard wet transfer based on potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution shows improvement in terms of cleanliness and structural integrity for dry-transferred layer, as evidenced by X-ray photoemission and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. Moreover, fabricated field-effect transistors (FETs) demonstrate improvements in subthreshold slope, maximum drain current and device-to-device variability. The dry-transfer method developed in this work enables large-area integration of 2D-TMDC layers into (opto)electronic components with high reproducibility, while better preserving the as-grown properties of the layers.</description>

      <title>Tunable acoustic energy concentrations based on pseudo-spin locking waveguides and topological rainbow trappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, tunable acoustic energy concentrations are realized based on pseudo-spin locking waveguides and topological rainbow trappings. Firstly, a tunable pseudo-spin locking is proposed, and the broad acoustic energy transport and spin-locked one-way transport are verified. The results show that acoustic wave transports based on pseudo-spin locking waveguides are more robust to structure defects than conventional topological edge-state waveguides. Besides, topological rainbow trappings are realized by adjusting the distribution of liquid in tubes. Based on those, we investigate the coupling of the pseudo-spin locking waveguides and the topological rainbow trappings. The results show that high acoustic energy concentrations can be obtained conveniently by using the coupling energy concentrator based on the pseudo-spin locking waveguides and the topological rainbow trappings. The results present a novel method to concentrate acoustic wave energy, which is vital in the application field of acoustic sensings and microfludics.
  The according experimental verifications will be presented in the near future.</description>

      <title>Analysis, Design, and Fabrication of a High-Gain Low-Profile Metasurface Antenna Using Direct Feeding of Sievenpiper s HIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HISs have recently shown the ability to support leaky waves, and to excite plasmonic and HIS resonance frequency modes for use as an antenna. In this paper, we analyzed, designed, and fabricated a TMA by directly feeding edge-located HIS cells through a microstrip feeding network. In contrast to other metasurface antennas that necessitate an external antenna to excite metasurfaces, our approach is inspired by the TMA design methodology that directly feeds the HIS cells rather than using it as a reflector. We developed a circuit model for the proposed structure and compared the results with those obtained from full-wave simulations. In addition, our further objective was to simplify the structure based on the working principle of the proposed antenna. This objective was achieved by converting square patches into parallel strip lines, leading to an aperture efficiency of 0.77. This simplification also creates additional space to explore various resonant patterns on the top surface and the feeding network on the bottom surface of the TMA. Full-wave simulation results indicate that, despite the compact dimensions of the proposed array with 64 electrically small patch resonators (1.84{\lambda}*1.84{\lambda}*0.032{\lambda}, where{\lambda}is the free space wavelength at 6.0 GHz), it achieves a realized gain, HPBW of about 15.1 dBi and 28{\deg} respectively at 6 GHz. Finally, we constructed a prototype and conducted measurements to validate the design. Measured results demonstrate good agreement with simulation ones with a gain of about 13.5 (+-0.5) dBi and a HPBW of 27{\deg} at 6 GHz. The proposed TMA is scaled to fit within the required dimensions for smart handheld devices at higher frequencies, while maintaining high gain capability. The design s scalability, single-feed, and compact footprint make it optimal for diverse wireless communication systems, such as car to car communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of classical waves in time-periodic systems is experiencing a resurgence of interest, motivated by their rich physics and the new engineering opportunities they enable, with several analogies to parallel efforts in other branches of physics, e.g., Floquet-engineered quantum materials and time crystals. Here, we first briefly review some of the most prominent features enabled by time-periodic modulations, and we then focus on two specific areas, namely, time-varying systems to break reciprocity and to overcome various theoretical limitations and performance bounds, discussing their current status, challenges, and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Scattering in Nonlinear Silicon Nanophotonic Waveguides: Theory and Applications in Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics caught world attention since channel capacity limit of metallic interconnects approached due to research and design in high speed digital processors. Use of dielectrics, instead, suitable for light propagation was more attractive due to its extremely wide bandwidth. Many of the devices, both active and passive, have been demonstrated using these insulating materials. Due to its excellent optical characteristics, established fabrication history, and cheaper throughput, silicon found its place in photonics arena. However, due to its indirect band structure, efficient light sources are not possible using silicon as the base material. Nevertheless, techniques such as stimulated Raman scattering and third-harmonic generation have made it possible to avoid this natural hurdle in the path of silicon as a light source. This paper reviews basic theory of stimulated Raman scattering, its applications in the context of silicon based photonic integrated circuits and describes ways to improve this nonlinear effect. This paper also covers few of the most important demonstrations of stimulated Raman scattering published in literature from the last decade.</description>

      <title>Effect of nonreciprocal thermal radiation on radiative cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative cooling has showcased great potential for passive refrigeration without extra energy consumption, while its cooling power and efficiency is confined by Kirchhoff's law, that is, the emissivity is equal to the absorptivity. The recent development of thermal nonreciprocity that breaks the limitations of Kirchhoff's law, especially in broadband manner, makes nonreciprocal radiative cooling (NRC) possible. Since there lacks of reports of NRC theoretically or experimentally, it is time to evaluate the feasibility and worthiness of develop NRC. Here, we discussed the effects of NRC at around room temperature (298.15 K) from three perspectives: ideal selective radiators, non-selective radiators, and colored radiators. Compared to the traditional reciprocal radiative cooling, the nonreciprocity within the non-atmospheric window band (4-8 {\mu}m or 13-25 {\mu}m) exhibits a certain gain, yet the nonreciprocity in the atmospheric window band (8-13 {\mu}m) results in a negative gain. Additionally, it should be noted that the radiators discussed in this work are horizontally placed without the influence of asymmetric external heat sources. The current findings shatter the inherent notion of nonreciprocal radiative cooling and offer some theoretical support for the practical realization and application of nonreciprocal radiative refrigeration devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Valley Photonic Waveguides: Scattering matrix evaluation for linear computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological boundary modes utilizing valley mode waveguides have opened opportunities in, for instance, the design of high transmission waveguides with tolerance to geometrical defects and sharp bends. Applications of these waveguides include linear computational processes and the emulation of logic gates using linear structures, among other scenarios. Here we present the design of a 6-port junction that exhibits equal power splitting to three other ports when excited at single port with no reflections. In studying this structure, a scattering matrix is extracted at telecom wavelengths (around 1550 nm). The linearity of the system along with the scattering matrix are exploited to produce linear operations such as routing of information considering two incident signals or multiple signals applied from different ports. Our work may be exploited to analytically design larger networks without the need of computationally expensive trial and error numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vector Network Analysis With a Photonic Frequency Extender Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a photonic ultra-wideband frequency extension for a commercial Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to perform free-space measurements in a frequency range from 70 GHz up to 520 GHz with a Hz level resolution. The concept is based on the synchronization of continuous-wave (CW) lasers with highly frequency-stable electronic emitter sources as a reference. The use of CW photomixers with bandwidths up to several terahertz allows for the straightforward expansion of the covered frequency range to 1 THz or even beyond. This can be achieved, for instance, by cascading additional lasers within the synchronization scheme. Consequently, the necessity for additional frequency extender modules, as seen in current state-of-the-art VNAs, is eliminated, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of the system significantly. To showcase the capabilities of the Photonic Vector Network Analyzer (PVNA) extender concept, we conducted S21 transmission measurements of various cross-shaped bandpass filters and waveguide-coupled high-frequency (HF) components. Additionally, the analyzed magnitude and phase data were either compared to electro-magnetic (EM) simulations or referenced against data obtained from commercial electronic frequency extender modules.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems play crucial roles in real-world applications, and many studies from a physics perspective have contributed to specialized hardware for high-speed computation. However, some combinatorial optimization problems are easy to solve, and others are not. Hence, the qualification of the difficulty in problem-solving will be beneficial. In this paper, we employ the Koopman analysis for multiple time-series data from the replica exchange Monte Carlo method. After proposing a quantity that aggregates the information of the multiple time-series data, we performed numerical experiments. The results indicate a negative correlation between the proposed quantity and the ability of the solution search.</description>

      <title>Sub-Millimeter-Scale Measurement of Local Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient Exceeding 100 W/(m^2-K) Using an Optical Pump-Probe Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional methods for measuring the local convective heat transfer coefficient (h_c) often rely on simplifying assumptions that can compromise accuracy. Pump-probe methods like time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) avoid these assumptions but are limited to h_c values larger than 30 kW/(m^2-K) due to modulation frequency constraints. This study introduces an optical-based Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) method, expanding the frequency range from 10 MHz to 1 Hz, enabling measurements of h_c values above 100 W/(m^2-K) with uncertainties under 10%. The efficacy of the SPS method is demonstrated through measurements of local h_c in an impingement heat transfer process with a single round gas jet. The local Nusselt number distribution is compared with existing literature correlations, offering insights into convective heat transfer phenomena. This study presents a novel tool for measuring local intrinsic convective heat transfer coefficients, enhancing the understanding of local convective heat transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A leaky wave antenna based on spin photonic topological insulators has been developed, featuring a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This configuration offers advantages over the zigzag arrangement, particularly with its wider leaky region and more suitable pattern. While the proposed antenna is a uniform leaky wave antenna, it is capable of radiating in both backward and forward directions. Notably, the transition through the broadside in the scanning range does not result in a significant drop in performance, despite the presence of an open stop band. This characteristic is unique among leaky wave antennas, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

Abstract: This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of photonic time crystals - artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties are periodically modulated in time at scales comparable to the oscillation period of light while remaining spatially uniform. Being the temporal analogs to traditional photonic crystals, photonic time crystals differ in that they exhibit momentum bandgaps instead of energy bandgaps. The energy is not conserved within momentum bandgaps, and eigenmodes with exponentially growing amplitudes exist in the momentum bandgap. Such properties make photonic time crystals a fascinating novel class of artificial materials from a basic science and applied perspective. This tutorial overviews the fundamental electromagnetic equations governing photonic time crystals and explores the groundbreaking physical phenomena they support. Based on these properties, we also oversee a diverse range of applications they unlock. Different material platforms suitable for creating photonic time crystals are discussed and compared. Furthermore, we elaborate on the connections between wave amplification in photonic time crystals and parametric amplification mechanisms in electrical circuits and nonlinear optics. The tutorial will be helpful for readers with physics or engineering backgrounds. It is designed to serve as an introductory guide for beginners and to establish a reference baseline reflecting the current understanding for researchers in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a promising technique to functionalize particle surfaces for energy applications including energy storage, catalysis, and decarbonization. In this work, we present a set of models of ALD particle coating to explore the transition from lab scale to manufacturing. Our models encompass the main particle coating manufacturing approaches including rotary bed, fluidized bed, and continuously vibrating reactors. These models provide key metrics, such as throughput and precursor utilization, required to evaluate the scalability of ALD manufacturing approaches and their feasibility in the context of energy applications. Our results show that designs that force the precursor to flow through fluidized particles transition faster to a transport-limited regime where throughput is maximized. They also exhibit higher precursor utilization. In the context of continuous processes, our models indicate that it is possible to achieve self-extinguishing processes with almost 100% precursor utilization. A comparison with past experimental results of ALD in fluidized bed reactors shows excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>
