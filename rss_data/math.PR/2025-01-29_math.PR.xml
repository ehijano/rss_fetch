      <title>Dynamics and large deviations for fractional stochastic partial differential equations with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with a kind of fractional stochastic evolution equations driven by L\'evy noise in a bounded domain. We first state the well-posedness of the problem via iterative approximations and energy estimates. Then, the existence and uniqueness of weak pullback mean random attractors for the equations {are} established by defining a mean random dynamical system. Next, we prove the existence of invariant measures when the problem is autonomous by means of the fact that $H^\gamma(\mathcal{O})$ is compactly embedded in $L^2(\mathcal{O})$ with $\gamma\in (0,1)$. Moreover, the uniqueness of this invariant measure is presented which ensures the ergodicity of the problem. Finally, a large deviation principle result for solutions of SPDEs perturbed by small L\'evy noise and Brownian motion is obtained by a variational formula for positive functionals of a Poisson random measure and Brownian motion. Additionally, the results are illustrated by the fractional stochastic Chafee-Infante equations</description>

      <title>The largest slice of fractal percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $k\ge 3$, we determine the dimensional threshold for planar fractal percolation to contain $k$ collinear points. In the critical case of dimension $1$, the largest linear slice of fractal percolation is a Cantor set of zero Hausdorff dimension. We investigate its size in terms of generalized Hausdorff measures.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical limits for models of car-sharing systems: the Autolib example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze mean-field equations obtained for models motivated by a large station-based car-sharing system in France called Autolib. The main focus is on a version where users reserve a parking space when they take a car. In a first model, the reservation of parking spaces is effective for all users (see [4]) and capacity constraints are ignored. The model is carried out in thermodynamical limit, that is when the number $N$ of stations and the number of cars $M_N$ tend to infinity, with $U = \lim_{N\to\infty} M_N/N$. This limit is described by Kolmogorov equations of a two-dimensional time-inhomogeneous Markov process depicting the numbers of reservations and cars at a station. It satisfies a non-linear differential system. We prove analytically that this system has a unique solution, which converges, as $t\to\infty$, to an equilibrium point exponentially fast. Moreover, this equilibrium point corresponds to the stationary distribution of a two queue tandem (reservations, cars), which is here always ergodic. The intensity factor of each queue has an explicit form obtained from an intrinsic mass conservation relationship. Two related models with capacity constraints are briefly presented in the last section: the simplest one with no reservation leads to a one-dimensional problem; the second one corresponds to our first model with finite total capacity $K$.</description>

      <title>Turing in the shadows of Nobel and Abel: an algorithmic story behind two recent prizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2021 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Giorgio Parisi ``for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales,'' and the 2024 Abel Prize in mathematics was awarded to Michel Talagrand ``for his groundbreaking contributions to probability theory and functional analysis, with outstanding applications in mathematical physics and statistics.'' What remains largely absent in the popular descriptions of these prizes, however, is the profound contributions the works of both individuals have had to the field of \emph{algorithms and computation}. The ideas first developed by Parisi and his collaborators relying on remarkably precise physics intuition, and later confirmed by Talagrand and others by no less remarkable mathematical techniques, have revolutionized the way we think algorithmically about optimization problems involving randomness. This is true both in terms of the existence of fast algorithms for some optimization problems, but also in terms of our persistent failures of finding such algorithms for some other optimization problems.
  The goal of this article is to highlight these developments and explain how the ideas pioneered by Parisi and Talagrand have led to a remarkably precise characterization of which optimization problems admit fast algorithms, versus those which do not, and furthermore to explain why this characterization holds true.</description>

      <title>The Integrable Snake Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pure snake configuration is a bijection $\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ containing no two-cycles and such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ we have $\sigma(x) \in \{ x , x+ \mathbf{e}^1, x+\mathbf{e}^2 , x- \mathbf{e}^2 \}.$ The non-trivial cycles of a pure snake configuration may be regarded as a collection of non-intersecting paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that may travel right, up, or down (but not left) from a given vertex. Pure snake configurations are a generalisation of lozenge tilings, which are in natural correspondence with paths that only travel right or up. We introduce a natural partition function on a finite version of this model, and study the probabilistic properties of random pure snake configurations chosen according to their contribution to this partition function. Under a suitable weighting, the model is integrable in the sense that we have access to explicit formulas for its partition and correlation functions. We utilise the integrable structure of this model in various applications, such as to prove a traffic representation of ASEP on the ring, generalising the analogous result for TASEP by the first author.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the Cucker--Smale model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an elementary proof of quantitative uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the Cucker--Smale model under sufficiently strong interaction. The idea is to combine existing finite-time propagation of chaos estimates with existing uniform-in-time stability estimates for the interacting particle system, in order to obtain a uniform-in-time propagation of chaos estimate with an explicit rate of convergence in the number of particles. This is achieved via a method that is similar in spirit to the classical 'stability + consistency implies convergence' approach in numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Randomised Euler-Maruyama method for SDEs with H\"older continuous drift coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the performance of randomised Euler-Maruyama (EM) method for additive time-inhomogeneous SDEs with an irregular drift. In particular, the drift is assumed to be $\alpha$-H\"older continuous in time and bounded $\beta$-H\"older continuous in space with $\alpha,\beta\in (0,1]$. The strong order of convergence of the randomised EM in $L^p$-norm is shown to be $1/2+(\alpha \wedge (\beta/2))-\epsilon$ for an arbitrary $\epsilon\in (0,1/2)$, higher than the one of standard EM, which is $\alpha \wedge (1/2+\beta/2-\epsilon)$. The proofs highly rely on the stochastic sewing lemma, where we also provide an alternative proof when handling time irregularity for a comparison.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov processes of bridge type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study McKean-Vlasov processes of bridge type. Specifically, we examine a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form: $$\mathrm{d} \xi_t=-\mu(t,\mathbb{E}[\varphi_1(\xi_t)]) \frac{\xi_t}{T-t} \mathrm{d} t+\sigma(t,\mathbb{E}[\varphi_2(\xi_t)]) \mathrm{d} W_t,\,\, t&lt;T,$$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are deterministic functions that depend on time $t$ and the expectation of given functions $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ of the process, and $W$ is a Brownian motion. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation and analyze the behavior of the process as $t$ approaches $T$. Furthermore, we provide conditions ensuring the pinned property of the process $\xi$. Finally, we explore explicit solutions in specific cases of interest, including power-weighted expectations and second moments in the drift.</description>

Abstract: We study multidimensional generalized backward stochastic differential equations (GBSDEs) within a general filtration that supports a Brownian motion under weak assumptions on the associated data. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in $\mathbb{L}^p$ for $p \in (1,2]$. Our results apply to generators that are stochastic monotone in the $y$-variable, stochastic Lipschitz in the $z$-variable, and satisfy a general stochastic linear growth condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random processes with stationary increments and intrinsic random processes are two concepts commonly used to deal with non-stationary random processes. They are broader classes than stationary random processes and conceptually closely related to each other. This paper illustrates the relationship between these two concepts of stochastic processes and shows that, under certain conditions, they are equivalent on the real line.</description>

      <title>Hard edge asymptotics of correlation functions between singular values and eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any square complex matrix of size $n\times n$ can be partially characterized by its $n$ eigenvalues and/or $n$ singular values. While no one-to-one correspondence exists between those two kinds of values on a deterministic level, for random complex matrices drawn from a bi-unitarily invariant ensemble, a bijection exists between the underlying singular value ensemble and the corresponding eigenvalue ensemble. This enabled the recent finding of an explicit formula for the joint probability density between $1$ eigenvalue and $k$ singular values, coined $1,k$-point function. We derive here the large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin (hard edge) for a large subclass of bi-unitarily invariant ensembles called P\'olya ensembles. This subclass contains all Meijer-G ensembles and, in particular, Muttalib-Borodin ensembles and the classical Wishart-Laguerre (complex Ginibre), Jacobi (truncated unitary), Cauchy-Lorentz ensembles. We show that the latter three ensembles share the same asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin. In the case of Jacobi ensembles, there exists another hard edge for the singular values, namely the upper edge of their support, which corresponds to a soft edge for the singular value (soft-hard edge). We give the explicit large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around this soft-hard edge.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit for an active-passive exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective non-equilibrium dynamics of multi-component mixtures of interacting active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles have garnered great interest in the physics community. However, the mathematical understanding of these systems remains partial. In this work, we consider a lattice gas model of active-passive particle mixtures with exclusion, where the self-propulsion orientations of active particles undergo Brownian motion on a torus. We derive the hydrodynamic equations governing the particle densities. Due to the presence of two types of particles with continuous-valued orientations, further generalizations of non-gradient decomposition and spectral gap estimation developed for the pure active case are necessitated, which entails novel challenges and new proofs.</description>

      <title>Liouville Brownian motion and quantum cones in dimension $d &gt; 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $d &gt; 2$ and $\gamma \in (0, \sqrt{2d})$, we study the Liouville Brownian motion associated with the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We compute its spectral dimension, i.e., the short-time asymptotics of the heat kernel along the diagonal, which, in contrast to the two-dimensional case, depends on both $\gamma$ and on the thickness of the starting point. Furthermore, for even dimensions $d &gt; 2$, we show that the spherical average process of the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be identified with the integral of a stationary Gaussian Markov process of order $(d-2)/2$. Exploiting this representation, we construct the higher-dimensional analogue of the $\beta$-quantum cone for $\beta \in (-\infty, Q)$, with $Q = d/\gamma + \gamma/2$. Lastly, for $\alpha = Q - \sqrt{Q^2-4}$, we prove that the law of the $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-quantum cone is invariant under shifts along the trajectories of the associated Liouville Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Log-Sobolev Inequality for Decoupled and McKean-Vlasov SDEs and Application on Exponential Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential ergodicity in the \( L^1 \)-Wasserstein distance for partially dissipative McKean-Vlasov SDEs has been extensively studied. However, the question of exponential ergodicity in the \( L^2 \)-Wasserstein distance and relative entropy has remained unresolved. This paper addresses the problem by establishing the log-Sobolev inequality for both the time-marginal distributions and the invariant probability measure, providing a positive resolution. As part of the groundwork, the log-Sobolev inequality is investigated for the associated time-inhomogeneous semigroup. The main results are further extended to degenerate diffusion.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Sylvester problem: Probabilities of combinatorial types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ be random points in $\mathbb R^d$. The classical Sylvester problem asks to determine the probability that the convex hull of these points, denoted by $P:= [X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}]$, is a simplex. In the present paper, we study a refined version of this problem which asks to determine the probability that $P$ has a given combinatorial type. It is known that there are $\lfloor d/2\rfloor+1$ possible combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-dimensional polytopes with at most $d+2$ vertices. These types are denoted by $T_0^d, T_1^d, \ldots, T_{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^d$, where $T_0^d$ is a simplex with $d+1$ vertices, while the remaining types have exactly $d+2$ vertices. Our aim is thus to compute the probability $$ p_{d,m} := \mathbb P[P \text{ is of type } T_{m}^d], \qquad m\in \{0,1,\ldots, \lfloor d/2 \rfloor\}. $$ The classical Sylvester problem corresponds to the case $m=0$. We shall compute $p_{d,m}$ for all $m$ in the following cases: (a) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ are i.i.d. normal; (b) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ follow a $d$-dimensional beta or beta prime distribution, which includes the uniform distribution on the ball or on the sphere as special cases; (c) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ form a random walk with symmetrically exchangeable increments. As a by-product of case (a) we recover a recent solution to Youden's demon problem which asks to determine the probability that, in a one-dimensional i.i.d. normal sample $\xi_1,\ldots, \xi_n$, the empirical mean $\frac 1n (\xi_1 + \ldots + \xi_n)$ lies between the $k$-th and the $(k+1)$-st order statistics. We also consider the conic (or spherical) version of the refined Sylvester problem and solve it in several special cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the H\"older continuity of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations of the form $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\mathcal{L}u+\sigma(u)\dot{F}$, subject to a suitable initial condition. The noise term $\dot{F}$ is white in time, colored in space, and $\mathcal{L}$ is the $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-generator of a L\'evy process. Under a growth assumption on the characteristic exponent of the L\'{e}vy process, we derive sufficient conditions for the solution to be locally H\"older continuous. Moreover, we show that these conditions are equivalent to those derived in related papers [16, 18, 19].</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Weak Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental theorem of classical optimal transport establishes strong duality and characterizes optimizers through a complementary slackness condition. Milestones such as Brenier's theorem and the Kantorovich-Rubinstein formula are direct consequences.
  In this paper, we generalize this result to non-linear cost functions, thereby establishing a fundamental theorem for the weak optimal transport problem introduced by Gozlan, Roberto, Samson, and Tetali. As applications we provide concise derivations of the Brenier--Strassen theorem, the convex Kantorovich--Rubinstein formula and the structure theorem of entropic optimal transport. We also extend Strassen's theorem in the direction of Gangbo--McCann's transport problem for convex costs. Moreover, we determine the optimizers for a new family of transport problems which contains the Brenier--Strassen, the martingale Benamou--Brenier and the entropic martingale transport problem as extreme cases.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a dual domain derivation of the error exponent of maximum mutual information (MMI) decoding with constant composition codes, showing it coincides with that of maximum likelihood decoding for discrete memoryless channels. The analysis is further extended to joint source-channel coding, demonstrating that the generalized MMI decoder achieves the same random coding error exponent as the maximum a posteriori decoder.</description>

      <title>Sharp exact recovery threshold for two-community Euclidean random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of label recovery in random graphs and matrices. Motivated by transitive behavior in real-world networks (i.e., ``the friend of my friend is my friend''), a recent line of work considers spatially-embedded networks, which exhibit transitive behavior. In particular, the Geometric Hidden Community Model (GHCM), introduced by Gaudio, Guan, Niu, and Wei, models a network as a labeled Poisson point process where every pair of vertices is associated with a pairwise observation whose distribution depends on the labels and positions of the vertices. The GHCM is in turn a generalization of the Geometric SBM (proposed by Baccelli and Sankararaman). Gaudio et al. provided a threshold below which exact recovery is information-theoretically impossible. Above the threshold, they provided a linear-time algorithm that succeeds in exact recovery under a certain ``distinctness-of-distributions'' assumption, which they conjectured to be unnecessary. In this paper, we partially resolve the conjecture by showing that the threshold is indeed tight for the two-community GHCM. We provide a two-phase, linear-time algorithm that explores the spatial graph in a data-driven manner in Phase I to yield an almost exact labeling, which is refined to achieve exact recovery in Phase II. Our results extend achievability to geometric formulations of well-known inference problems, such as the planted dense subgraph problem and submatrix localization, in which the distinctness-of-distributions assumption does not hold.</description>

Abstract: This article shows that the capacity region of a 2-users weak Gaussian interference channel is achieved using Gaussian code-books. The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps.

      <title>Private Minimum Hellinger Distance Estimation via Hellinger Distance Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hellinger distance has been widely used to derive objective functions that are alternatives to maximum likelihood methods. Motivated by recent regulatory privacy requirements, estimators satisfying differential privacy constraints are being derived. In this paper, we describe different notions of privacy using divergences and establish that Hellinger distance minimizes the added variance within the class of power divergences for an additive Gaussian mechanism. We demonstrate that a new definition of privacy, namely Hellinger differential privacy, shares several features of the standard notion of differential privacy while allowing for sharper inference. Using these properties, we develop private versions of gradient descent and Newton-Raphson algorithms for obtaining private minimum Hellinger distance estimators, which are robust and first-order efficient. Using numerical experiments, we illustrate the finite sample performance and verify that they retain their robustness properties under gross-error contamination.</description>

      <title>Sampling with time-changed Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study time-changed Markov processes to speed up the convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms in the context of multimodal distributions and rare event simulation. The time-changed process is defined by adjusting the speed of time of a base process via a user-chosen, state-dependent function. We apply this framework to several Markov processes from the MCMC literature, such as Langevin diffusions and piecewise deterministic Markov processes, obtaining novel modifications of classical algorithms and also re-discovering known MCMC algorithms. We prove theoretical properties of the time-changed process under suitable conditions on the base process, focusing on connecting the stationary distributions and qualitative convergence properties such as geometric and uniform ergodicity, as well as a functional central limit theorem. A comparison with the framework of space transformations is provided, clarifying the similarities between the approaches. Throughout the paper we give various visualisations and numerical simulations on simple tasks to gain intuition on the method and its performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes various approaches to modeling a random process with a given rational power spectral density. The main attention is paid to the spectral form of mathematical description, which allows one to obtain a relation for the shaping filter using a transfer function without any additional calculations. The paper provides all necessary relations for the implementation of the shaping filter based on the spectral form of mathematical description.</description>

      <title>A divisor generating $q$-series and cumulants arising from random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uchimura, in 1987, introduced a probability generating function for a random variable $X$ and using properties of this function he discovered an interesting $q$-series identity. He further showed that the $m$-th cumulant with respect to the random variable $X$ is nothing but the generating function for the generalized divisor function $\sigma_{m-1}(n)$. Simon, Crippa, and Collenberg, in 1993, explored the $G_{n,p}$-model of a random acyclic digraph and defined a random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$. Quite interestingly, they found links between limit of its mean and the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. Later in 1997, Andrews, Crippa, and Simon extended these results using $q$-series techniques. They calculated limit of the mean and variance of the random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$ which correspond to the first and second cumulants. In this paper, we calculate limit of the third, fourth, and fifth cumulants. Observing a pattern among cumulants, we propose a conjecture for the limit of the $t$-th cumulant in terms of the generalized divisor function. Furthermore, we also discover limit forms for identities of Uchimura and Dilcher. This provides a fourth side to the Uchimura-Ramanujan-divisor type three way partition identities expounded by the authors recently.</description>

      <title>Random Reshuffling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Sharp low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive novel sharp low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide sharp estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring--Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Building upon previous works by Young, Chernov-Zhang and Bruin-Melbourne-Terhesiu, we present a general scheme to improve bounds on the statistical properties (in particular, decay of correlations, and rates in the almost sure invariant principle) for a class of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. Specifically, for systems with polynomial, yet summable mixing rates, our method removes logarithmic factors of earlier arguments, resulting in essentially optimal bounds. Applications include Wojtkowski's system of two falling balls, dispersing billiards with flat points and Bunimovich's flower-shaped billiard tables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hailperin (1965) introduced a linear programming formulation to a difficult family of problems, originally proposed by Boole (1854,1868). Hailperin's model is computationally still difficult and involves an exponential number of variables (in terms of a typical input size for Boole's problem). Numerous papers provided efficiently computable bounds for the minimum and maximum values of Hailperin's model by using aggregation that is a monotone linear mapping to a lower dimensional space. In many cases the image of the positive orthant is a subcone of the positive orthant in the lower dimensional space, and thus including some of the defining inequalities of this subcone can tighten up such an aggregation model, and lead to better bounds. Improving on some recent results, we propose a hierarchy of aggregations for Hailperin's model and a generic approach for the analysis of these aggregations. We obtain complete polyhedral descriptions of the above mentioned subcones and obtain significant improvements in the quality of the bounds.</description>

      <title>Utility maximization in multivariate Volterra models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with portfolio selection for an investor with power utility in multi-asset financial markets in a rough stochastic environment. We investigate Merton's portfolio problem for different multivariate Volterra models, covering the rough Heston model. First we consider a class of multivariate affine Volterra models introduced in [E. Abi Jaber et al., SIAM J. Financial Math., 12, 369-409, (2021)]. Based on the classical Wishart model described in [N. B\"auerle and Li, Z., J. Appl. Probab., 50, 1025-1043 (2013)], we then introduce a new matrix-valued stochastic volatility model, where the volatility is driven by a Volterra-Wishart process. Due to the non-Markovianity of the underlying processes, the classical stochastic control approach cannot be applied in these settings. To overcome this issue, we provide a verification argument using calculus of convolutions and resolvents. The resulting optimal strategy can then be expressed explicitly in terms of the solution of a multivariate Riccati-Volterra equation. We thus extend the results obtained by Han and Wong to the multivariate case, avoiding restrictions on the correlation structure linked to the martingale distortion transformation used in [B. Han and Wong, H. Y., Finance Res. Lett., 39 (2021)]. We also provide existence and uniqueness theorems for the occurring Volterra processes and illustrate our results with a numerical study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that under a multi-scale heavy traffic condition, the stationary distribution of the scaled queue length vector process in any generalized Jackson network has a product-form limit. Each component in the product form follows an exponential distribution, corresponding to the Brownian approximation of a single station queue. The ``single station'' can be constructed precisely and its parameters have a good intuitive interpretation.</description>

      <title>Universality of global asymptotics of Jack-deformed random Young diagrams at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two distinct discrete versions of $\beta$-ensembles in the high, low and fixed temperature regimes. Our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and \'Sniady.
  We first introduce a special class of Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size, called the ``Jack--Thoma measures'', and prove the LLN and CLT in the three aforementioned limit regimes. In each case, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed as sums of weighted lattice paths. Second, we show that the previous formulas are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations for the model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size derived from Jack characters with the approximate factorization property. Finally, in stark contrast with continuous $\beta$-ensembles, we show that the limit shapes at high and low temperatures of our random Young diagrams are one-sided infinite staircase shapes. For the Jack--Plancherel measure, we describe this shape explicitly by relating its local minima with the zeroes of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>A test of a conjecture of Cardy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reference to Werner's measure on self-avoiding loops on Riemann surfaces, Cardy conjectured a formula for the measure of all homotopically nontrivial loops in a finite type annular region with modular parameter $\rho$. Ang, Remy and Sun have announced a proof of this conjecture using random conformal geometry. Cardy's formula implies that the measure of the set of homotopically nontrivial loops in $\mathbb C^{\times}$ which intersect $S^1$ equals $\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}}$. This set is the disjoint union of the set of loops which avoid a ray from the unit circle to infinity and its complement. There is an inclusion/exclusion sum which, in a limit, calculates the measure of the set of loops which avoid a ray. Each term in the sum involves finding the transfinite diameter of a slit domain. This is numerically accessible using the remarkable Schwarz-Christoffel package developed by Driscoll and Trefethen. Our calculations suggest this sum is around $\pi$, consistent with Cardy's formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary search trees (BST) are a popular type of data structure when dealing with ordered data. Indeed, they enable one to access and modify data efficiently, with their height corresponding to the worst retrieval time. From a probabilistic point of view, binary search trees associated with data arriving in a uniform random order are well understood, but less is known when the input is a non-uniform random permutation. We consider here the case where the input comes from i.i.d. random points in the plane with law $\mu$, a model which we refer to as a permuton sample. Our results show that the asymptotic proportion of nodes in each subtree depends on the behavior of the measure $\mu$ at its left boundary, while the height of the BST has a universal asymptotic behavior for a large family of measures $\mu$. Our approach involves a mix of combinatorial and probabilistic tools, namely combinatorial properties of binary search trees, coupling arguments, and deviation estimates.</description>

      <title>Specific Wasserstein divergence between continuous martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining a divergence between the laws of continuous martingales is a delicate task, owing to the fact that these laws tend to be singular to each other. An important idea, put forward by N. Gantert, is to instead consider a scaling limit of the relative entropy between such continuous martingales sampled over a finite time grid. This gives rise to the concept of specific relative entropy. In order to develop a general theory of divergences between continuous martingales, it is only natural to replace the role of the relative entropy in this construction by a different notion of discrepancy between finite dimensional probability distributions. In the present work we take a first step in this direction, taking a power $p$ of the Wasserstein distance instead of the relative entropy. We call the newly obtained scaling limit the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence.
  In our first main result we prove that the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence is well-defined, exhibit an explicit expression for it in terms of the quadratic variations of the martingales involved, and compare it with the specific relative entropy and adapted Wasserstein distance on a class of SDEs. Next we consider the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence optimization over the set of win-martingales. In our second main result we characterize the solution of this optimization problem for all $p&gt;0$ and, somewhat surprisingly, we single out the case $p=1/2$ as the one with the best probabilistic properties. For instance, the optimal martingale in this case is very explicit and can be connected to the solution of a variant of the Schr\"odinger problem.</description>

Abstract: We extend Bobkov and Chistyakov's (2015) upper bounds on concentration functions of sums of independent random variables to a multivariate entropic setting. The approach is based on pointwise estimates on densities of sums of independent random vectors uniform on centred Euclidean balls. In this vein, we also obtain sharp bounds on volumes of noncentral sections of isotropic convex bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the expected number of solutions of a system of identically distributed exponential sums with centered Gaussian coefficient and arbitrary variance. We use the Adler and Taylor theory of Gaussian random fields to identify a moment map which allows to express the expected number of solution as an integral over the Newton polytope, in analogy with the Bernstein Khovanskii Kushnirenko Theorem. We apply this result to study the monotonicity of the expected number of solution with respect to the support of the exponential sum in an open set. We find that, when a point is added in the support in the interior of the Newton polytope there exists an open sets where the expected number of solutions decreases, answering negatively to a local version of a conjecture by B\"urgisser. When the point added in the support is far enough away from the Newton polytope we show that, in dimension 1, the number of solutions increases everywhere, while in dimension &gt;1 there is an unbounded open set where the number of solution decreases. We also prove some new lower bounds for the Aronszajn multiplication of exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Quasi-multiplicativity and regularity for metric graph Gaussian free fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove quasi-multiplicativity for critical level-sets of Gaussian free fields (GFF) on the metric graphs $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}^d$ ($d\ge 3$). Specifically, we study the probability of connecting two general sets located on opposite sides of an annulus with inner and outer radii both of order $N$, where additional constraints are imposed on the distance of each set to the annulus. We show that for all $d \ge 3$ except the critical dimension $d=6$, this probability is of the same order as $N^{(6-d)\land 0}$ (serving as a correction factor) times the product of the two probabilities of connecting each set to the closer boundary of this annulus. The analogue for $d=6$ is also derived, although the upper and lower bounds differ by a divergent factor of $N^{o(1)}$. Notably, it was conjectured by Basu and Sapozhnikov (2017) that quasi-multiplicativity without correction factor holds for Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ when $3\le d&lt;6$ and fails when $d&gt;6$. In high dimensions (i.e., $d&gt;6$), taking into account the similarity between the metric graph GFF and Bernoulli percolation (which was proposed by Werner (2016) and later partly confirmed by the authors (2024)), our result provides support to the conjecture that Bernoulli percolation exhibits quasi-multiplicativity with correction factor $N^{6-d}$.
  During our proof of quasi-multiplicativity, numerous regularity properties, which are interesting in their own right, were also established.
  A crucial application of quasi-multiplicativity is proving the existence of the incipient infinite cluster (IIC), which has been completed by Basu and Sapozhnikov (2017) for Bernoulli percolation for $3\le d&lt;6$. Inspired by their work, in a companion paper, we also utilize quasi-multiplicativity to establish the IIC for metric graph GFFs, for all $d\ge 3$ except for the critical dimension $6$.</description>

      <title>Incipient infinite clusters and volume growth for Gaussian free fields and loop soups on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence and equivalence of four types of incipient infinite clusters (IICs) for the critical Gaussian free field (GFF) level-set and the critical loop soup on the metric graph $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}^d$ for all $d\ge 3$ except the critical dimension $d=6$. These IICs are defined as four limiting conditional probabilities, involving different conditionings and various ways of taking limits:
  (1) conditioned on $\{0 \leftrightarrow{} \partial B(N)\}$ at criticality (where $0$ is the origin of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and $\partial B(N)$ is the boundary of the box $B(N)$ centered at $0$ with side length $2N$), and letting $N\to \infty$;
  (2) conditioned on $\{0\leftrightarrow{} \infty\}$ at super-criticality, and letting the parameter tend to the critical threshold;
  (3) conditioned on $\{0 \leftrightarrow{} x\}$ at criticality (where $x\in \mathbb{Z}^d$ is a lattice point), and letting $x\to \infty$;
  (4) conditioned on the event that the capacity of the critical cluster containing $0$ exceeds $T$, and letting $T\to \infty$.
  Our proof employs a robust framework of Basu and Sapozhinikov (2017) for constructing IICs as in (1) and (2) for Bernoulli percolation in low dimensions (i.e., $3\le d\le 5$), where a key hypothesis on the quasi-multiplicativity is proved in our companion paper.
  We further show that conditioned on $\{0 \leftrightarrow{} \partial B(N)\}$, the volume of the critical cluster containing $0$ within $B(M)$ is typically of order $M^{(\frac{d}{2}+1)\land 4}$, as long as $N\gg M$. This phenomenon indicates that the critical cluster of the GFF or the loop soup exhibits self-similarity, which supports Werner's conjecture (2016) that such cluster has a scaling limit. Moreover, the exponent of $M^{(\frac{d}{2}+1)\land 4}$ matches the conjectured fractal dimension of the scaling limit proposed by Werner (2016).</description>

Abstract: The process $(\int_0^t e^{2b_s-b_t}\, ds\ ;\ t\ge 0)$, where $b$ is a real Brownian motion, is known as the geometric 2M-X Matsumoto-Yor process. Remarkably, it enjoys the Markov property. We provide a generalization of this process to the context of Jordan algebras, and we prove the Markov property for this generalization.
  Our Markov process occurs as a limit of discrete-time AX+B Markov chains on the cone of squares whose invariant probability measures classically provide a Dufresne-type identity for a perpetuity. In particular, the paper provides a generalization to any symmetric cone of the initial matrix generalization of the Matsumoto-Yor process and Dufresne identity by Rider-Valk\'o.</description>

We get that for any k&lt;c\sqrt{n}, the probability of the matrix has a lower rank than n-k that is sub-exponential. Furthermore, we get a deviation inequality for the singular values of A. This extends earlier results of Rudelson's paper in 2024 by removing the assumption of the identical distribution of the entries across the matrix. Our model covers inhomogeneous matrices, allowing different subgaussian moments for the entries as long as their subgaussian moments have a standard upper bound. In the past advance, the assumption of i.i.d entries was required due to the lack of least common denominators of the non-i.i.d random matrix. We can overcome this problem using a randomized least common denominator (RLCD) from Livshyts in 2021.</description>

      <title>Weak rough kernel comparison via PPDEs for integrated Volterra processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in physics (e.g., turbulence intermittency) and financial mathematics (e.g., rough volatility), this paper examines a family of integrated stochastic Volterra processes characterized by a small Hurst parameter $H&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$. We investigate the impact of kernel approximation on the integrated process by examining the resulting weak error. Our findings quantify this error in terms of the $L^1$ norm of the difference between the two kernels, as well as the $L^1$ norm of the difference of the squares of these kernels. Our analysis is based on a path-dependent Feynman-Kac formula and the associated partial differential equation (PPDE), providing a robust and extendible framework for our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the exact probability density function of the product of $N$ independent variance-gamma random variables with zero location parameter. We then apply this formula to derive formulas for the cumulative distribution function and characteristic function, as well as asymptotic approximations for the density, tail probabilities and quantile function. From our general results, we deduce closed-form formulas for the density, cumulative distribution function and characteristic function of the product of $N$ independent asymmetric Laplace random variables and mixed products of independent Laplace and centred normal random variables.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Species in a Competition Model on Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the coexistence of two competing species on random geometric graphs (RGGs) in continuous time. The species grow by occupying vacant sites according to Richardson's model, while simultaneously competing for occupied sites under the dynamics of the voter model. Coexistence is defined as the event in which both species occupy at least one site simultaneously at any given time. We prove that coexistence occurs with strictly positive annealed probability by applying results from moderate deviations in first-passage percolation and random walk theory, with a focus on specific regions of the space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multivariate Hahn polynomials are constructed explicitly as the common eigenvectors of a family of second order difference operators. They are orthogonal with respect to the hypergeometric multinomial distribution. The main difference operator is adopted from the work of Karlin-McGregor in 1975. The minor ones are the subsets of the main one containing less and less variables. These operators commute with each other. In contrast to the multivariate Krawtchouk and Rahman like polynomials derived recently, the entire multivariate Hahn polynomials are rational functions of the system parameters. Complete sets of multivariate Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are derived by limiting procedures.</description>

      <title>Properties of the generalized inverse Gaussian with applications to Monte Carlo simulation and distribution function evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized inverse Gaussian, denoted $\mathrm{GIG}(p, a, b)$, is a flexible family of distributions that includes the gamma, inverse gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions as special cases. In addition to its applications in statistical modeling and its theoretical interest, the GIG often arises in computational statistics, especially in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for posterior inference. This article introduces two mixture representations for the GIG: one that expresses the distribution as a continuous mixture of inverse Gaussians and another that reveals a recursive relationship between GIGs with different values of $p$. The former representation forms the basis for a data augmentation scheme that leads to a geometrically ergodic Gibbs sampler for the GIG. This simple Gibbs sampler, which alternates between gamma and inverse Gaussian conditional distributions, can be incorporated within an encompassing MCMC algorithm when simulation from a GIG is required. The latter representation leads to algorithms for exact, rejection-free sampling as well as CDF evaluation for the GIG with half-integer $p.$ We highlight computational examples from the literature where these new algorithms could be applied.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the mod 2 homology of random 2-dimensional determinantal hypertrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a first step towards a conjecture of Kahle and Newman, we prove that if $T_n$ is a random $2$-dimensional determinantal hypertree on $n$ vertices, then \[\frac{\dim H_1(T_n,\mathbb{F}_2)}{n^2}\] converges to zero in probability.
  Confirming a conjecture of Linial and Peled, we also prove the analogous statement for the $1$-out $2$-complex.
  Our proof relies on the large deviation principle for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph by Chatterjee and Varadhan.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for the matching number of a sparse random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1981, Karp and Sipser proved a law of large numbers for the matching number of a sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, in an influential paper pioneering the so-called differential equation method for analysis of random graph processes. Strengthening this classical result, and answering a question of Aronson, Frieze and Pittel, we prove a central limit theorem in the same setting: the fluctuations in the matching number of a sparse random graph are asymptotically Gaussian.
  Our new contribution is to prove this central limit theorem in the subcritical and critical regimes, according to a celebrated algorithmic phase transition first observed by Karp and Sipser. Indeed, in the supercritical regime, a central limit theorem has recently been proved in the PhD thesis of Krea\v{c}i\'c, using a stochastic generalisation of the differential equation method (comparing the so-called Karp-Sipser process to a system of stochastic differential equations). Our proof builds on these methods, and introduces new techniques to handle certain degeneracies present in the subcritical and critical cases. Curiously, our new techniques lead to a non-constructive result: we are able to characterise the fluctuations of the matching number around its mean, despite these fluctuations being much smaller than the error terms in our best estimates of the mean.
  We also prove a central limit theorem for the rank of the adjacency matrix of a sparse random graph.</description>

      <title>All You Need is Resistance: On the Equivalence of Effective Resistance and Certain Optimal Transport Problems on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of effective resistance and optimal transport on graphs are filled with rich connections to combinatorics, geometry, machine learning, and beyond. In this article we put forth a bold claim: that the two fields should be understood as one and the same, up to a choice of $p$. We make this claim precise by introducing the parameterized family of $p$-Beckmann distances for probability measures on graphs and relate them sharply to certain Wasserstein distances. Then, we break open a suite of results including explicit connections to optimal stopping times and random walks on graphs, graph Sobolev spaces, and a Benamou-Brenier type formula for $2$-Beckmann distance. We further explore empirical implications in the world of unsupervised learning for graph data and propose further study of the usage of these metrics where Wasserstein distance may produce computational bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. In contrast, examples exhibiting additivity, though relatively rare, offer crucial insights into the origins of nonadditivity and form the basis of our strongest upper bounds on capacity. Degradable channels, whose coherent information is provably additive, stand out as among the few classes of channels for which the quantum capacity is exactly computable.
  In this paper, we introduce two families of non-degradable channels whose coherent information remains additive, making their quantum capacities tractable. First, we demonstrate that channels capable of ``outperforming" their environment, under conditions weaker than degradability, can exhibit either strong or weak additivity of coherent information. Second, we explore a complementary construction that modifies a channel to preserve coherent information additivity while destroying the ``outperforming" property. We analyze how structural constraints guarantee strong and weak additivity and investigate how relaxing these constraints leads to the failure of strong additivity, with weak additivity potentially persisting.</description>

      <title>Unified Stochastic Framework for Neural Network Quantization and Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization and pruning are two essential techniques for compressing neural networks, yet they are often treated independently, with limited theoretical analysis connecting them. This paper introduces a unified framework for post-training quantization and pruning using stochastic path-following algorithms. Our approach builds on the Stochastic Path Following Quantization (SPFQ) method, extending its applicability to pruning and low-bit quantization, including challenging 1-bit regimes. By incorporating a scaling parameter and generalizing the stochastic operator, the proposed method achieves robust error correction and yields rigorous theoretical error bounds for both quantization and pruning as well as their combination.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed. This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>
