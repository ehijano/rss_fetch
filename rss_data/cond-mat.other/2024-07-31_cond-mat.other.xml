      <title>Hydrogen Diffusion in Magnesium Using Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and accurately predicting hydrogen diffusion in materials is challenging due to the complex interactions between hydrogen defects and the crystal lattice. These interactions span large length and time scales, making them difficult to address with standard ab initio techniques. This work addresses this challenge by employing accelerated machine learning (ML) molecular dynamics simulations through active learning. We conduct a comparative study of different ML-based interatomic potential schemes, including VASP, MACE, and CHGNet, utilizing various training strategies such as on-the-fly learning, pre-trained universal models, and fine-tuning. We obtain an optimal hydrogen diffusion coefficient value of \(2.1 \cdot 10^{-8}\) m\(^2\)/s at 673 K in MgH\(_{0.06}\), which aligns exceptionally well with experimental results, underlining the efficacy and accuracy of ML-assisted methodologies in the context of diffusive dynamics. Particularly, our procedure significantly reduces the computational effort associated with traditional transition state calculations or ad-hoc designed interatomic potentials. The results highlight the limitations of pre-trained universal solutions for defective materials and how they can be improved by fine-tuning. Specifically, fine-tuning the models on a database produced during on-the-fly training of VASP ML force field allows the retrieving of DFT-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic approach to reproduce multiple spinning vortices in horizontally rotating three-dimensional liquid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of a rotating liquid helium-4, using a two-fluid model with spin-angular momentum conservation. Our model was derived from the particle approximation of an inviscid fluid with residual viscosity. Despite the fully classical mechanical picture, the resulting system equations were consistent with those of the conventional two-fluid model. We consider bulk liquid helium-4 to be an inviscid fluid, assuming that the viscous fluid component remains at finite temperatures. As the temperature decreased, the amount of the viscous fluid component decreased, ultimately becoming a fully inviscid fluid at absolute zero. Weak compressibility is assumed to express the volume change because some helium atoms do not render fluid owing to BECs or change states because of local thermal excitation. One can solve the governing equations for an incompressible fluid using explicit SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), simultaneously reproducing density fluctuations and describing the fluid in a many-particle system. We assume the following fluid-particle duality: a hydrodynamic interfacial tension between the inviscid and viscous components or a local interaction force between two types of fluid particles. The former can be induced in the horizontal direction when non-negligible non-uniformity of the particles occurs during forced two-dimensional rotation, and the latter is non-negligible when the former is negligible. We performed a largescale simulation of 3D liquid helium forced to rotate horizontally using 32 GPUs. Compared with the low-resolution calculation using 2.4 million particles, the high-resolution calculation using 19.6 million particles showed spinning vortices close to those of the theoretical solution. We obtained a promising venue to establish a practical simulation method for bulk liquid helium-4.</description>
