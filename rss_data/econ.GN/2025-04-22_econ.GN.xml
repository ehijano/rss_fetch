      <title>Effects of Price Regulations on Service Utilization and Public Insurance Costs: Evidence from Telehealth Parity Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores Telehealth Parity Laws (TPLs) and their heterogeneous treatment effects by policy type on outpatient utilization and Medicare costs, considering broadband and licensure infrastructure. State-specific legislative framings create varied Price (physician reimbursement) and Cost (consumer expense) control combinations within a quasi-experimental design. Partial equilibrium causal estimates reveal negligible impacts on Medicare enrollment, indicating that Medicare cost shifts stem purely from outpatient utilization changes. Broadband access correlates with increased preventable hospital stays but lower Medicare costs and enrollment. Additionally, the Interstate Licensure Compact increases enrollment among the aged and disabled, possibly addressing previously unmet demand for healthcare services.</description>

      <title>Identity Dilemma in Immigrant Consumers: a discourse analysis of diaspora marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose - Diasporas of a country of origin are groups interested in country-of-origin scattered in host countries and familiar with markets of host countries. This paper aims to discourse analysis of diaspora marketing researches. Methodology - In judgmental sampling using selected keywords 24 researches in two eras before and after 2010 are selected for discourse analysis. Faircloughs critical discourse analysis model is used to analyze research data. Findings- Two different discourses can be distinguished in diaspora marketing researches. The diaspora niche marketing discourse is focused on penetrating into diaspora niche market. The diaspora marketing strategy discourse is focused on developing into international market using diaspora leverage. Research limitations and implications - Judgmental sampling and lived experience of researchers in a developing country which is usually considered as a diasporas country of origin rather than a diasporas host country limit the generalizability of research results. Practical implications - Understanding the extensions of diaspora marketing concept and diaspora marketing discourses is helpful for designing appropriate strategies for entering and developing in the international market. Originality - this paper investigates extensions of diaspora concept in previous research identifies diaspora marketing discourses and compares dominant diaspora marketing discourse with global marketing discourse.</description>

      <title>Agricultural Economics and Innovation in the Inca Empire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By studying the Inca Empire's agricultural accomplishments, we learn how ancient civilizations adapted to their circumstances, used natural resources effectively, and sustained agriculture for millennia. This understanding affects global food production systems as we face land degradation, climate change, and sustainable farming. Inca terrace farming is a sustainable and innovative food production method still relevant today. By studying the past and applying its ideas to modern agriculture, we can make global food production more sustainable and resilient. Keywords: Inca Empire, Terrace farming, Agricultural innovation, Food production, ancient civilizations, Crop diversity</description>

      <title>Evidence of Donor Bias in Chicago Police Stops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides the first empirical evidence that private donations to police departments can influence officer behavior. Drawing on the psychology of reciprocity bias, we theorize that public donations create social debts that shape discretionary enforcement. Using quasi-experimental data from Chicago, we find that after 7-Eleven sponsored a police foundation gala, investigatory stops, particularly of Black pedestrians, increased around its stores. These findings reveal a racialized pattern of donor bias in policing and call into question the consequences of private donations to public law enforcement.</description>

      <title>Human aversion? Do AI Agents Judge Identity More Harshly Than Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the understudied role of algorithmic evaluation of human judgment in hybrid decision-making systems, a critical gap in management research. While extant literature focuses on human reluctance to follow algorithmic advice, we reverse the perspective by investigating how AI agents based on large language models (LLMs) assess and integrate human input. Our work addresses a pressing managerial constraint: firms barred from deploying LLMs directly due to privacy concerns can still leverage them as mediating tools (for instance, anonymized outputs or decision pipelines) to guide high-stakes choices like pricing or discounts without exposing proprietary data. Through a controlled prediction task, we analyze how an LLM-based AI agent weights human versus algorithmic predictions. We find that the AI system systematically discounts human advice, penalizing human errors more severely than algorithmic errors--a bias exacerbated when the agent's identity (human vs AI) is disclosed and the human is positioned second. These results reveal a disconnect between AI-generated trust metrics and the actual influence of human judgment, challenging assumptions about equitable human-AI collaboration. Our findings offer three key contributions. First, we identify a reverse algorithm aversion phenomenon, where AI agents undervalue human input despite comparable error rates. Second, we demonstrate how disclosure and positional bias interact to amplify this effect, with implications for system design. Third, we provide a framework for indirect LLM deployment that balances predictive power with data privacy. For practitioners, this research emphasize the need to audit AI weighting mechanisms, calibrate trust dynamics, and strategically design decision sequences in human-AI systems.</description>

      <title>Where do local markets fit in the current European Electricity Market structures?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: European electricity markets have been complex since their inception. Policies and technologies advancing renewable integration, consumer empowerment, flexibility, and electrification are reshaping generation and consumption, increasing this complexity. System operators face congestion, voltage management, and redispatch challenges while market actors navigate imbalances and volatility. New market structures, such as energy communities and local flexibility markets, aim to address local energy dynamics and integrate decentralized flexibility. However, their fit within existing market frameworks remains unclear, leading to inconsistent interpretations and regulatory uncertainties. This manuscript presents a graphical classification of local markets, positioning them within electricity procurement (e.g., wholesale) and system operation (e.g., ancillary) services while illustrating their interrelations. Despite their potential, these markets remain in early development, facing regulatory ambiguities, resource limitations, and coordination challenges.</description>

      <title>AI Safety Should Prioritize the Future of Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current efforts in AI safety prioritize filtering harmful content, preventing manipulation of human behavior, and eliminating existential risks in cybersecurity or biosecurity. While pressing, this narrow focus overlooks critical human-centric considerations that shape the long-term trajectory of a society. In this position paper, we identify the risks of overlooking the impact of AI on the future of work and recommend comprehensive transition support towards the evolution of meaningful labor with human agency. Through the lens of economic theories, we highlight the intertemporal impacts of AI on human livelihood and the structural changes in labor markets that exacerbate income inequality. Additionally, the closed-source approach of major stakeholders in AI development resembles rent-seeking behavior through exploiting resources, breeding mediocrity in creative labor, and monopolizing innovation. To address this, we argue in favor of a robust international copyright anatomy supported by implementing collective licensing that ensures fair compensation mechanisms for using data to train AI models. We strongly recommend a pro-worker framework of global AI governance to enhance shared prosperity and economic justice while reducing technical debt.</description>

      <title>Wildfire Modeling: Designing a Market to Restore Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13773v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, summer wildfires have become the norm in California, and the United States of America. These wildfires are caused due to variety of reasons. The state collects wildfire funds to help the impacted customers. However, the funds are eligible only under certain conditions and are collected uniformly throughout California. Therefore, the overall idea of this project is to look for quantitative results on how electrical corporations cause wildfires and how they can help to collect the wildfire funds or charge fairly to the customers to maximize the social impact. The research project aims to propose the implication of wildfire risk associated with vegetation, and due to power lines and incorporate that in dollars. Therefore, the project helps to solve the problem of collecting wildfire funds associated with each location and incorporate energy prices to charge their customers according to their wildfire risk related to the location to maximize the social surplus for the society. The thesis findings will help to calculate the risk premium involving wildfire risk associated with the location and incorporate the risk into pricing. The research of this submitted proposal provides the potential contribution towards detecting the utilities associated wildfire risk in the power lines, which can prevent wildfires by controlling the line flows of the system. Ultimately, the goal of this proposal is a social benefit to save money for the electrical corporations and their customers in California, who pay flat charges for Wildfire Fund each month $0.00580/kWh (in dollars). Therefore, this proposal will propose new method to collect wildfire fund with maximum customer surplus for future generations.</description>

      <title>Digital Platform Consolidation and Offline Expansion: Strategic Convergence and Market Welfare in China's Second-hand Real Estate Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of offline expansion and online platform consolidation in China's second-hand real estate market. Using micro-level transaction data and difference-in-differences estimations, we find offline store entry significantly boosts transaction volumes (9-10\%) and reduces price concessions (1\%) initially, though effects diminish over time. Platform consolidation via Lianjia's Agent Cooperation Network yields delayed yet persistent transaction volume increases (5-6\%), particularly in less concentrated markets, and consistently lowers price concessions. These strategies sustainably enhance brokerage competitiveness, bargaining power, and market welfare, despite increased market concentration, ultimately benefiting sellers and improving overall efficiency.</description>

      <title>Prompt Adaptation as a Dynamic Complement in Generative AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14333v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative AI systems rapidly improve, a key question emerges: How do users keep up-and what happens if they fail to do so. Drawing on theories of dynamic capabilities and IT complements, we examine prompt adaptation-the adjustments users make to their inputs in response to evolving model behavior-as a mechanism that helps determine whether technical advances translate into realized economic value. In a preregistered online experiment with 1,893 participants, who submitted over 18,000 prompts and generated more than 300,000 images, users attempted to replicate a target image in 10 tries using one of three randomly assigned models: DALL-E 2, DALL-E 3, or DALL-E 3 with automated prompt rewriting. We find that users with access to DALL-E 3 achieved higher image similarity than those with DALL-E 2-but only about half of this gain (51%) came from the model itself. The other half (49%) resulted from users adapting their prompts in response to the model's capabilities. This adaptation emerged across the skill distribution, was driven by trial-and-error, and could not be replicated by automated prompt rewriting, which erased 58% of the performance improvement associated with DALL-E 3. Our findings position prompt adaptation as a dynamic complement to generative AI-and suggest that without it, a substantial share of the economic value created when models advance may go unrealized.</description>
