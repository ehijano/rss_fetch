      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Nuclear Star Cluster of the Milky Way: alpha-Element Trends and Their Similarities with the Inner Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chemical characterization of the Galactic Center is essential for understanding its formation and structural evolution. Trends of alpha-elements, such as Mg, Si, and Ca, serve as powerful diagnostic tools, offering insights into star-formation rates and gas-infall history. However, high extinction has previously hindered such studies. In this study, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of M giants in the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC), focusing on alpha-element trends with metallicity. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra were obtained using the IGRINS spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope for nine M giants. Careful selection of spectral lines, based on a solar-neighborhood control sample of 50 M giants, was implemented to minimize systematic uncertainties. Our findings show enhanced alpha-element abundances in the predominantly metal-rich NSC stars, consistent with trends in the inner bulge. The NSC stars follow the high-[alpha/Fe] envelope seen in the solar vicinity's metal-rich population, indicating a high star-formation rate. The alpha-element trends decrease with increasing metallicity, also at the highest metallicities. Our results suggest the NSC population likely shares a similar evolutionary history with the inner bulge, challenging the idea of a recent dominant star formation burst. This connection between the NSC and the inner-disk sequence suggests that the chemical properties of extragalactic NSCs of Milky Way type galaxies could serve as a proxy for understanding the host galaxies' evolutionary processes.</description>

      <title>EMPRESS. X. Spatially resolved mass-metallicity relation in extremely metal-poor galaxies: evidence of episodic star-formation fueled by a metal-poor gas infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Subaru/FOCAS IFU capability, we examine the spatially resolved relationships between gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass, and star-formation rate surface densities (Sigma_* and Sigma_SFR, respectively) in extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) in the local universe. Our analysis includes 24 EMPGs, comprising 9,177 spaxels, which span a unique parameter space of local metallicity (12+log(O/H) = 6.9 to 7.9) and stellar mass surface density (Sigma_* ~ 10^5 to 10^7 Msun/kpc^2), extending beyond the range of existing large integral-field spectroscopic surveys. Through spatially resolved emission line diagnostics based on the [NII] BPT-diagram, we verify the absence of evolved active galactic nuclei in these EMPGs. Our findings reveal that, while the resolved mass-metallicity relation exhibits significant scatter in the low-mass regime, this scatter is closely correlated with local star-formation surface density. Specifically, metallicity decreases as Sigma_SFR increases for a given Sigma_*. Notably, half of the EMPGs show a distinct metal-poor horizontal branch on the resolved mass-metallicity relation. This feature typically appears at the peak clump with the highest Sigma_* and Sigma_SFR and is surrounded by a relatively metal-enriched ambient region. These findings support a scenario in which metal-poor gas infall fuels episodic star formation in EMPGs, consistent with the kinematic properties observed in these systems. In addition, we identify four EMPGs with exceptionally low central metallicities (12+log(O/H) &lt;~ 7.2), which display only a metal-poor clump without a surrounding metal-rich region. This suggests that such ultra-low metallicity EMPGs, at less than a few percent of the solar metallicity, may serve as valuable analogs for galaxies in the early stages of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ionizers with Low H$\boldsymbol{\beta}$+[OIII] Equivalent Widths: JADES Spectroscopy of a Peculiar High-z Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early JWST photometric studies discovered a population of UV faint ($\rm &lt;L^{*}_{UV}$) $z \sim 6.5-8$ Lyman break galaxies with spectral energy distributions implying young ages ($\sim10$ Myr) yet relatively weak H$\beta$+[OIII] equivalent widths ($\rm EW_{H\beta+[OIII]} \approx 400$\r{A}). These galaxies seemingly contradict the implicit understanding that young star-forming galaxies are ubiquitously strong H$\beta$+[OIII] emitters, i.e., extreme emission line galaxies (EW $\rm \gtrsim 750$\r{A}). Low metallicities, high Lyman continuum escape fractions, and rapidly declining star-formation histories have been proposed as primary drivers behind low H$\beta$+[OIII] equivalent widths, but the blend of H$\beta$+[OIII] in photometric studies makes proving one of these scenarios difficult. We aim to characterize this peculiar population with deep spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We find that a significant subset of these galaxies at $z\gtrsim2$ with modest H$\beta$+[OIII] equivalent widths ($\rm \approx 300-600$\r{A}) have high ionization efficiencies ($\rm \log \xi_{ion} \gtrsim 25.5~[Hz~erg^{-1}]$). Suppressed [OIII] EW values yet elevated H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ EW values imply that the level of chemical enrichment is the primary culprit, supported by spectroscopic measurements of metallicities below 12+log(O/H)$\rm \approx 7.70~(10\%Z_{\odot})$. We demonstrate that integrated H$\beta$+[OIII] selections (e.g., H$\beta$+[OIII] EW $&gt; 700$\r{A}) exclude the most metal-poor efficient ionizers and favor 1) more chemically enriched systems with comparable extreme radiation fields and 2) older starbursting systems. In contrast, metallicity degeneracies are reduced in H$\alpha$ space, enabling the identification of these metal-poor efficient ionizers by their specific star-formation rate.</description>

      <title>MUSEQuBES: Unveiling Cosmic Web Filaments at $z\approx3.6$ through Dual Absorption and Emission Line Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to modern cosmological models, galaxies are embedded within cosmic filaments, which supply a continuous flow of pristine gas, fueling star formation and driving their evolution. However, due to their low density, the direct detection of diffuse gas in cosmic filaments remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely metal-poor ($[ X/H] \approx -3.7$), low-density ($\log_{10} n_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-3}} \approx -4$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\approx 5$) partial Lyman limit system (pLLS) at $z\approx3.577$ along the quasar sightline Q1317--0507, probing cosmic filaments. Additionally, two other low-metallicity ($[ X/H] \lesssim -2$) absorption systems are detected at similar redshifts, one of which is also a pLLS. VLT/MUSE observations reveal a significant overdensity of Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) associated with the pLLS. The spatial distribution of the LAEs strongly suggests the presence of an underlying filamentary structure. This is further supported by the detection of a large Ly-alpha emitting nebula with a surface brightness of $\geq 10^{-19}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~arcsec^{-2}$, with a maximum projected linear size of $\approx 260$~pkpc extending along the LAEs.</description>

      <title>Fading Light, Fierce Winds: JWST Snapshot of a Sub-Eddington Quasar at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at $z\sim6.25$ likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim3\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.4$. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds ($\nu\sim10^4~{\rm km/s}$). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion $\sim$5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio ($\gtrsim10$), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>On the signature of black holes on the quenched stellar mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As star-forming galaxies approach or exceed a stellar mass around $10^{11} M_\odot$, they are increasingly likely to be quenched in a process generically called mass quenching. Central galaxies, which are quenched via mass rather than environmental quenching, therefore accumulate in a peak around this characteristic mass. While a number of processes may influence the shape of the quenched central stellar mass function (QCSMF), we find that its low-mass slope is strongly affected by the scatter in the mass of black holes at a given stellar mass, with higher scatters in the black hole population yielding shallower slopes. Higher scatters in the black hole mass spread out the stellar mass range over which quenching occurs, leading to shallower slopes. This trend holds across a variety of semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. A comparison with observations provides indirect evidence for a large scatter in black hole mass $\sigma(\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{BH})|M_*) \gtrsim 0.5$ dex, and a joint constraint on AGN feedback physics and the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes.</description>

      <title>An unambiguous AGN and a Balmer break in an Ultraluminous Little Red Dot at z=4.47 from Ultradeep UNCOVER and All the Little Things Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed exploration of the most optically-luminous Little Red Dot ($L_{H\alpha}=10^{44}$erg/s, $L_V=10^{45}$erg/s, F444W=22AB) found to date. Located in the Abell 2744 field, source A744-45924 was observed by NIRSpec/PRISM with ultradeep spectroscopy reaching SNR$\sim$100pix$^{-1}$, high-resolution 3-4 micron NIRCam/Grism spectroscopy, and NIRCam Medium Band imaging. The NIRCam spectra reveal high rest-frame EW $W_{H\alpha,0,broad}&gt;800$\r{A}, broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM$\sim$4500 km/s), on top of narrow, complex absorption. NIRSpec data show exceptionally strong rest-frame UV to NIR Fe II emission ($W_{FeII-UV,0}\sim$340\r{A}), N IV]$\lambda\lambda$1483,1486 and N III]$\lambda$1750, and broad NIR O I $\lambda$8446 emission. The spectra unambiguously demonstrate a broad-line region associated with an inferred $M_{BH}\sim10^9M_\odot$ supermassive black hole embedded in dense gas, which might explain a non-detection in ultradeep Chandra X-ray data (&gt;$10\times$ underluminous relative to broad $L_{H\alpha}$). Strong UV Nitrogen lines suggest supersolar N/O ratios due to rapid star formation or intense radiation near the AGN. The continuum shows a clear Balmer break at rest-frame 3650\r{A}, which cannot be accounted for by an AGN power-law alone. A stellar population model produces an excellent fit with a reddened Balmer break and implying a massive ($M_*\sim8\times10^{10}M_\odot$), old $\sim$500 Myr, compact stellar core, among the densest stellar systems known ($\rho\sim3\times10^6M_\odot$/pc$^2$ for $R_{e,opt}=70\pm10$ pc), and AGN emission with extreme intrinsic EW $W_{H\alpha,0}\gg$1000\r{A}. However, although high $M_*$ and $M_{BH}$ are supported by evidence of an overdensity containing 40 galaxies at $z=4.41-4.51$, deep high-resolution spectroscopy is required to confirm stellar absorption and rule out that dense gas around the AGN causes the Balmer break instead.</description>

      <title>X-raying CAMELS: Constraining Baryonic Feedback in the Circum-Galactic Medium with the CAMELS simulations and eRASS X-ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) around massive galaxies plays a crucial role in regulating star formation and feedback. Using the CAMELS simulation suite, we develop emulators for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the X-ray luminosity--stellar mass scaling relation to investigate how stellar and AGN feedback shape the X-ray properties of the hot CGM. Our analysis shows that at CGM scales ($10^{12} \lesssim M_{\rm halo}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{13}$, $10\lesssim r/{\rm kpc} \lesssim 400$), stellar feedback more significantly impacts the X-ray properties than AGN feedback within the parameters studied. Comparing the emulators to recent eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations, it was found that stronger feedback than currently implemented in the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid simulations is required to match observed CGM properties. However, adopting these enhanced feedback parameters causes deviations in the stellar-mass-halo-mass relations from observational constraints below the group mass scale. This tension suggests possible unaccounted systematics in X-ray CGM observations or inadequacies in the feedback models of cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of bar formation mechanisms I: does a tidally-induced bar rotate slower than an internally-induced bar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic bars can form via the internal bar instability or external tidal perturbations by other galaxies. We systematically compare the properties of bars formed through the two mechanisms with a series of controlled $N$-body simulations that form bars through internal or external mechanisms. We create three disk galaxy models with different dynamical ``hotness'' and evolve them in isolation and under flyby interactions. In the cold and warm disk models, where bars can form spontaneously in isolation, tidally-induced bars are promoted to a more ``advanced'' evolutionary stage. However, these bars have similar pattern speeds to those formed spontaneously within the same disk. Bars formed from both mechanisms have similar distributions in pattern speed--bar strength ($\Omega_p-A_2$) space and exhibit comparable ratios of co-rotation radius to bar length (${\cal R}={R_{\mathrm {CR}}}/{R_{\mathrm {bar}}}$). Dynamical analyses suggest that the inner stellar disk loses the same amount of angular momentum, irrespective of the presence or intensity of the perturbation, which possibly explains the resemblance between tidally and spontaneously formed bars. In the hot disk model, which avoids the internal bar instability in isolation, a bar forms only under perturbations and rotates more slowly than those in the cold and warm disks. Thus, if ``tidally-induced bars'' refer exclusively to those in galaxies that are otherwise stable against bar instability, they indeed rotate slower than internally-induced ones. However, the pattern speed difference is due to the difference in the internal properties of the bar host galaxies, not the different formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) XIII. Cool gas traced by MgII around isolated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is a key component needed to understand the physical processes governing the flows of gas around galaxies. Quantifying its evolution and its dependence on galaxy properties is particularly important for our understanding of accretion and feedback mechanisms. We select a volume-selected sample of 66 {\it isolated} star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $0.4&lt; z &lt;1.5$ with $\log(M_\star/M_{\odot})&gt; 9$ from the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey. Using MgII 2796,2803 absorptions in background quasars, we measure the covering fraction $f_c$ and quantify how the cool gas profile depends on galaxy properties (such as star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_\star$) or azimuthal angle relative to the line of sight) and how these dependencies evolve with redshift. The MgII covering fraction of isolated galaxies is a strong function of impact parameter, and is steeper than previously reported. The impact parameter $b_{50}$ at which $f_c = $50\% is $b_{50}=50\pm7$kpc ($65\pm7$ kpc) for $W_r^{2796}&gt;$0.5 \AA ($W_r^{2796}&gt;0.1$ \AA), respectively. It is weakly correlated with SFR ($\propto$ SFR$^{0.08\pm0.09}$) and decreases with cosmic time ($\propto (1+z)^{0.8 \pm 0.7}$), contrary to the expectation of increasingly larger halos with time. The covering fraction is also higher along the minor axis than along the major axis at the $\approx 2 \sigma$ level. The CGM traced by \MgII{} is similar across the isolated galaxy population. Indeed, among the isolated galaxies with an impact parameter below 55 kpc, all have associated MgII absorption with $W_r^{2796}&gt;$0.3\AA, resulting in a steep covering fraction $f_c(b)$.</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a large ($\sim 10$ kpc diameter), massive ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.15^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$), grand-design spiral galaxy with photometric redshift $z_{\text{phot}} = 4.03$ in the UNCOVER and Medium Band Mega Science surveys with JWST. This is the highest redshift spiral galaxy discovered with JWST so far. In the rest-frame near-UV and far-UV, we clearly see the beads-on-a-string pattern of star formation; in the rest-frame visible bands, each string appears as an arm. Spectral energy distribution modeling using the Bagpipes code is strongly constrained by detections and flux measurements in 21 JWST and HST filters. The stellar mass-weighted age is 228 Myr, implying that 50% of the stars in the galaxy formed after $z \sim 4.5$. This is a highly star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate (SFR) of $57.57^{+1.80}_{-1.90} \, M_\odot\, \text{yr}^{-1}$. We detect strong H-$\alpha$ + [NII] emission from the entire disk. The detection of a spiral galaxy at $z \sim 4$ indicates that massive and large spiral galaxies and disks were already in place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Red, hot, and very metal poor: extreme properties of a massive accreting black hole in the first 500 Myr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently discovered a new population of objects at high redshift referred to as `Little Red Dots' (LRDs). Their nature currently remains elusive, despite their surprisingly high inferred number densities. This emerging population of red point-like sources is reshaping our view of the early Universe and may shed light on the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present a spectroscopically confirmed LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z_{\rm spec}=8.6319\pm 0.0005$ hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), using JWST data. This source shows the typical spectral shape of an LRD (blue UV and red optical continuum, unresolved in JWST imaging), along with broad H$\beta$ line emission, detection of high-ionization emission lines (CIV, NIV]) and very high electron temperature indicative of the presence of AGN. This is also combined with a very low metallicity ($Z&lt;0.1 Z_\odot$). The presence of all these diverse features in one source makes CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 unique. We show that the inferred black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 ($M_{\rm BH}=1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\times 10^{8}\rm ~M_\odot$) strongly challenges current standard theoretical models and simulations of black hole formation, and forces us to adopt `ad hoc' prescriptions. Indeed if massive seeds, or light seeds with super-Eddington accretion, are considered, the observed BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z=8.6$ can be reproduced. Moreover, the black hole is over-massive compared to its host, relative to the local $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relations, pointing towards an earlier and faster evolution of the black hole compared to its host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Non-linear magnetic buoyancy instability and galactic dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic buoyancy (MBI) and Parker instabilities are strong and generic instabilities expected to occur in most astrophysical systems with sufficiently strong magnetic fields. In galactic and accretion discs, large-scale magnetic fields are thought to result from the mean-field dynamo action, in particular, the $\alpha^2\Omega$. Using non-ideal MHD equations, we model a section of the galactic disc in which the large-scale magnetic field is generated by an imposed $\alpha$-effect and differential rotation. We extend our earlier study of the interplay between magnetic buoyancy and the mean-field dynamo. We add differential rotation which enhances the dynamo and cosmic rays which enhance magnetic buoyancy. We construct a simple 1D model which replicates all significant features of the 3D simulations. We confirm that magnetic buoyancy can lead to oscillatory magnetic fields and discover that it can vary the magnetic field parity between quadrupolar and dipolar, and that inclusion of the differential rotation is responsible for the switch in field parity. Our results suggest that the large-scale magnetic field can have a dipolar parity within a few kiloparsecs of the galactic centre, provided the MBI is significantly stronger the the dynamo. Quadrupolar parity can remain predominant in the outer parts of a galactic disc. Cosmic rays accelerate both the dynamo and the MBI and support oscillatory non-linear states, a spatial magnetic field structure similar to the alternating magnetic field directions observed in some edge-on galaxies.</description>

      <title>The reliability of gas-phase metallicities immediately adjacent to non-star-forming spaxels in MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use gas phase metallicities calculated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) Data Release 17 (DR17) to assess the extent of potential biases in spaxels which are spatially adjacent to spaxels identified as non-star forming (non-SF) on a BPT diagram. We identify a sample of $\sim21,000$ such spaxels with calculable metallicities from the full metallicity catalogue ($\sim$1.57 million), representing a small fraction ($\sim1.3$ per cent) of the full metallicity sample. $\sim$23 per cent of all galaxies with at least one spaxel with a calculable metallicity also contain at least one spaxel with a calculated metallicity adjacent to a non-SF spaxel, with a typical galaxy hosting 9 non-SF-adjacent spaxels. From our suite of 6 different metallicity calibrations, we find that only the metallicity calibrations based entirely on the [NII]$_{6584}$/H$\alpha$ ratio are affected, showing systematic offsets to higher metallicities by up to $\sim$0.04 dex if they are located adjacent to a non-SF flagged spaxel, relative to a radially matched control sample. The inclusion of additional diagnostic diagrams (based on [OI]$_{6300}$~\&amp;/or [SII]$_{6717+6731}$) is insufficient to remove the observed offset in the [NII]$_{6584}$/H$\alpha$ based calibrations. Using a stricter diagnostic line on the BPT diagram removes $\sim$94 per cent of identified bordering spaxels with metallicities for all metallicity calibrations, and removes the residual offset to higher metallicity values seen in [NII]$_{6584}$/H$\alpha$ calibrations. If science cases demand an exceptionally clean metallicity sample, we recommend either a stricter BPT cut, and/or a non-[NII]$_{6584}$/H$\alpha$ based metallicity calibration.</description>

      <title>Lack of Rest-frame UV Variability in Little Red Dots Based on HST and JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability is a fundamental signature for active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, and serve as an unbiased indicator for rapid instability happened near the center supermassive black hole (BH). Previous studies showed that AGN variability does not have strong redshift evolution, and scales with their bolometric luminosity and BH mass, making it a powerful probe to identify low-mass, low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift. JWST has discovered a new population of high-redshift galaxies likely hosting moderate accreting BHs ($10^6\,M_\odot$) -- the little red dots (LRDs, $z=4-10$). In this paper, we study the variability of a sample of 21 LRDs with V-shaped SEDs in three JWST deep fields that also have reliable HST observations in closely paired filters at 1-2 um (rest-frame UV), with the time difference between 6 and 11 years. This LRD sample covers a redshift range of $3&lt;z&lt;8$ with median -21.3$&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;$-18.4. Based on both photometry and imaging difference analyses, we find a mean magnitude difference of 0.12$\pm$0.24 mag, with none of the LRDs showing photometric variability at 3$\sigma$ significance. Extrapolation of SDSS quasar variability predicts a magnitude change of order 0.3 mag for our LRD sample. This suggests an upper limit of about 30\% AGN contribution to the total observed UV light in our sample of LRDs.</description>

      <title>proEQUIB: IDL Library for Plasma Diagnostics and Abundance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emission lines emitted from gaseous nebulae carry valuable information about the physical conditions and chemical abundances of ionized gases in these objects, as well as the interstellar extinction. "proEQUIB" is a library containing several application programming interface (API) functions developed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), which can be used for plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis of nebular spectra. This IDL library can also be used by the GNU Data Language (GDL), which is a free and open-source IDL compiler. This package includes several API functions to determine physical conditions and chemical abundances from collisionally excited lines (CEL) and recombination lines (RL), derive interstellar extinctions from Balmer lines, and deredden the observed fluxes. This IDL library heavily relies on the IDL Astronomy User's library and the IDL "AtomNeb" library. The API functions of this IDL library can easily be utilized for spatially-resolved studies of ionized gaseous nebulae observed using integral field spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Origins and Dynamics of the Hierarchical Triple Star System CN Lyn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we present a detailed analysis of CN Lyn, an overlooked triple star system, by combining spectroscopic data from the literature, photometric \textit{TESS} data, and kinematic techniques. We updated the fundamental parameters of the known eclipsing components in the system with high precision. The chemical composition of both eclipsing components (Aab) and the third component (B) in the system were calculated with great accuracy. According to our analysis the mass, radius, and metallicity of the eclipsing components are $1.166_{-0.012}^{+0.013}\,M_\odot$, $1.786_{-0.014}^{+0.013}\,R_\odot$, and $-0.78_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ dex for Aa and $1.143_{-0.012}^{+0.013}\,M_\odot$, $1.651_{-0.013}^{+0.014}\,R_\odot$, and $-0.55_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ dex for Ab. The pair's age is $3.89_{-0.10}^{+0.10}$ Gyr. The mass, radius, metallicity, and age for B are $0.85_{-0.23}^{+0.23}\,M_\odot$, $1.436_{-0.023}^{+0.026}\,R_\odot$, $-1.83_{-0.11}^{+0.09}$ dex, and $12.5_{-2.5}^{+2.5}$ Gyr, respectively. It is also found that the triple system (AabB) satisfies the stability criteria for the hierarchical triple system. Kinematic and Galactic orbital parameters of CN Lyn were obtained from the astrometric and spectroscopic data of the system. Dynamical orbital analyses, taking into account the ages of the component stars in the central binary system (A) show that the CN Lyn originated at the metal-poor edge of the Galactic disk. The third component of the system was found to be a member of the halo population in terms of age, $\alpha$ elements and metal abundance. Given the different chemical abundances and age of B compared to A, this suggests that the third component was captured by the central system in a region with weak gravitational interactions far beyond the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>A compact group lens modeled with GIGA-Lens: Enhanced inference for complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of large-scale astronomical surveys, fast modeling of strong lens systems has become increasingly vital. While significant progress has been made for galaxy-scale lenses, the development of automated methods for modeling larger systems, such as groups and clusters, is not as extensive. Our study aims to extend the capabilities of the GIGA-Lens code, enhancing its efficiency in modeling multi-galaxy strong lens systems. We focus on demonstrating the potential of GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference in handling complex lensing scenarios with a high number of free parameters. We employ an improved inference approach that combines image position and pixelated data with an annealing sampling technique to obtain the posterior distribution of complex models. This method allows us to overcome the challenge of limited prior information, a high number of parameters, and memory usage. Our process is exemplified through the analysis of the compact group lens system DES J0248-3955, for which we present VLT/X-shooter spectra. We measure a redshift of $z = 0.69 \pm 0.04$ for the group, and $z = 1.2722 \pm 0.0005$ for one of the extended arcs. Our enhanced method successfully constrained a lens model with 29 free parameters and lax priors in a remarkably short time. The mass of the lens is well described by a single dark-matter halo with a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v = (690 \pm 30) \, km \, s^{-1}$. The model predicts the presence of a second source at the same redshift and a third source at approximately $z \sim 2.7$. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of our lens modeling technique for dealing with a complex system in a short time using ground-based data. This presents considerable potential within the context of large surveys such as LSST.</description>

      <title>A substellar flyby that shaped the orbits of the giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modestly eccentric and non-coplanar orbits of the giant planets pose a challenge to solar system formation theories which generally indicate that the giant planets emerged from the protoplanetary disk in nearly perfectly circular and coplanar orbits. We demonstrate that a single encounter with a 2-50 Jupiter-mass object, passing through the solar system at a perihelion distance less than 20 AU and a hyperbolic excess velocity less than 6 km/s, can excite the giant planets' eccentricities and mutual inclinations to values comparable to those observed. We estimate that there is about a 1-in-100 chance that such a flyby produces a dynamical architecture similar to that of the solar system. We describe a metric to evaluate how closely a simulated system matches the eccentricity and inclination secular modes of the solar system. The scenario of a close encounter with a substellar object offers a plausible explanation for the origin of the moderate eccentricities and inclinations and the secular architecture of the planets.</description>

      <title>SDSS J100711.74+193056.2: A Candidate Common Motion Substellar Companion to the Nearest B-Type Star Regulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The L9 dwarf SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is situated 7$^{\circ}$.5 north of the nearest B-type star Regulus (d = 24.3+-0.2 pc), part of a stellar quadruplet. The object is at similar distance (d = 21.9+-1.0 pc) as Regulus, with a 3D separation of 3.9+0.6-0.5 pc ($\sim$1.6 tidal radii from Regulus), and shares tangential motion within 2 km/s, hinting at a physical connection. Near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck/NIRES finds that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 also has a comparable radial velocity as Regulus A and B, a metallicity similar to Regulus B, and a spectral morphology consistent with the estimated 1--2 Gyr total age of Regulus's close pre-white dwarf companion. Taken together, these observations indicate that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is a very widely-separated and potentially physically-bound companion to Regulus, with a binding energy and mass ratio comparable to other wide star-brown dwarf systems. It joins a growing list of brown dwarfs at the L dwarf/T dwarf transition with independent constraints on physical properties such as age and metallicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this third paper in a series, we investigate the need of spectra denoising for the derivation of stellar parameters. We have used two distinct datasets for this work. The first one contains spectra in the range of 4450-5400 {\AA} at a resolution of 42000 and the second in the range of 8400-8800 {\AA} at a resolution of 11500. We constructed two denoising techniques, an autoencoder, and a Principal Component Analysis. Using random Gaussian noise added to synthetic spectra, we have trained a Neural Network to derive the stellar parameters Teff, log g, ve sin i, {\xi}t, and [M/H] of the denoised spectra. We find that, independently of the denoising technique, the stellar parameters accuracy values do not improve once we denoise the synthetic spectra. This is true with and without applying data augmentation to the stellar parameters Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Hubble constant through the galaxy pairwise peculiar velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant $H_0$, the current expansion rate of the universe, is one of the most important parameters in cosmology. The cosmic expansion regulates the mutually approaching motion of a pair of celestial objects due to their gravity. Therefore, the mean pairwise peculiar velocity of celestial objects, which quantifies their relative motion, is sensitive to both $H_0$ and the dimensionless total matter density $\Omega_m$. Based on this, using the Cosmicflows-4 data, we measured $H_0$ for the first time via the galaxy pairwise velocity in the nonlinear and quasi-linear range. Our results yield $H_0=75.5\pm1.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_m=0.311^{+0.029}_{-0.028}$ . The uncertainties of $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ can be improved to around 0.6% and 2%, respectively, if the statistical errors become negligible in the future.</description>

Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager balloon payload (COSI-Balloon) is a wide-field-of-view Compton ${\gamma}$-ray telescope that operates in the 0.2 - 5 MeV bandpass. COSI-Balloon had a successful 46-day flight in 2016 during which the instrument observed the Crab Nebula, Cygnus X-1, and Centaurus A. Using the data collected by the COSI-Balloon instrument during this flight, we present the source flux extraction of signals from the variable balloon background environment and produce images of these background-dominated sources by performing Richardson-Lucy deconvolutions. We also present the spectra measured by the COSI-Balloon instrument, compare and combine them with measurements from other instruments, and fit the data. The Crab Nebula was observed by COSI-Balloon and we obtain a measured flux in the energy band 325 - 480 keV of (4.5 ${\pm}$ 1.6) ${\times}$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The model that best fits the COSI-Balloon data combined with measurements from NuSTAR and Swift-BAT is a broken power law with a measured photon index ${\Gamma}$ = 2.20 ${\pm}$ 0.02 above the 43 keV break. Cygnus X-1 was also observed during this flight, and we obtain a measured flux of (1.4 ${\pm}$ 0.2) ${\times}$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the same energy band and a best-fit result (including data from NuSTAR, Swift-BAT, and INTEGRAL/ IBIS) was to a cutoff power law with a high-energy cutoff energy of 138.3 ${\pm}$ 1.0 keV and a photon index of ${\Gamma}$ = 1.358 ${\pm}$ 0.002. Lastly, we present the measured spectrum of Centaurus A and our best model fit to a power law with a photon index of ${\Gamma}$ = 1.73 ${\pm}$ 0.01.</description>

      <title>Eta-Earth Revisited II: Deriving a Maximum Number of Earth-like Habitats in the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Lammer et al. 2024, we defined Earth-like Habitats (EH) as rocky planets in the habitable zone of complex life (HZCL) on which Earth-like N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$ can exist and derived a formula for estimating their maximum number in the Galaxy. Here, we apply this formula by considering only requirements that are already scientifically quantifiable. By implementing models for star formation rate, initial mass function, and galactic mass distribution, we calculate the spatial distribution of disk stars as functions of stellar mass and birth age. We apply models for the GHZ and evaluate the thermal stability of Earth-like atmospheres with various CO$_2$ mixing ratios by implementing the newest stellar evolution and upper atmosphere models. In addition, we include the rocky exoplanet frequency, the availability of oceans and subaerial land, and the potential large moon requirement by evaluating their importance and implementing these criteria from minima to maxima values. We also discuss factors that are not yet scientifically quantifiable but may be requirements for EHs to evolve. We find that EHs are rare by obtaining maximum numbers of $2.5^{+71.6}_{-2.4}\times10^{5}$ and $0.6^{+27.1}_{-0.59}\times10^{5}$ planets that can potentially host N$_2$-Earth-like atmospheres with maximum CO$_2$ mixing ratios of 10\% and 1\%, respectively, implying that a minimum of $\sim 10^3 - 10^6$ rocky HZCL planets are needed for 1 EH to evolve. Their actual number, however, may be substantially lower as several requirements are not included in our model; this also implies ETIs are significantly rarer still. Our results illustrate that neither every star can host EHs, nor that each rocky HZCL planet evolves such that it may be able to host complex animal-like life. The Copernican Principle therefore cannot be applied to infer that such life is common in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Open Cluster Study Using $Gaia$ I:Membership and Cluster Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star clusters are interesting laboratories to study star formation, single and binary stellar evolution, and stellar dynamics. We have used the exquisite data from $Gaia$'s data release 3 (DR3) to study 21 relatively rich and nearby open clusters with member numbers ($N_{\rm{cl}}$)$&gt;500$. We have developed a non-parametric method to identify cluster members. Our method works well for clusters located in both sparse and crowded environments, hence, can be applied to a wide variety of star clusters. Since the member classification scheme does not make any assumptions on the expected distributions of potential cluster members, our method can identify members associated with clusters that are oddly shaped or have complex internal spatial or kinematic structures. In addition, since the membership determination does not depend on the proximity to any well-defined sequences on the color-magnitude diagram, this method easily identifies straggler members. Furthermore, for each of these clusters, we estimate essential cluster properties including age, metallicity, distance, and reddening using detailed Markov-Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation. We report the full posteriors for these important cluster properties for all clusters in our study.</description>

      <title>The Survey of Surveys: machine learning for stellar parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning method to assign stellar parameters (temperature, surface gravity, metallicity) to the photometric data of large photometric surveys such as SDSS and SKYMAPPER. The method makes use of our previous effort in homogenizing and recalibrating spectroscopic data from surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, or LAMOST into a single catalog, which is used to inform a neural network. We obtain spectroscopic-quality parameters for millions of stars that have only been observed photometrically. The typical uncertainties are of the order of 100K in temperature, 0.1 dex in surface gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity and the method performs well down to low metallicity, were obtaining reliable results is known to be difficult.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Galaxy Field Generation with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of precision cosmology, the ability to generate accurate and large-scale galaxy catalogs is crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe. With the flood of cosmological data from current and upcoming missions, generating theoretical predictions to compare with these observations is essential for constraining key cosmological parameters. While traditional methods, such as the Halo-Occupation Distribution (HOD), have provided foundational insights, they struggle to balance the need for both accuracy and computational efficiency. High-fidelity hydrodynamic simulations offer improved precision but are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning approach that harnesses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Diffusion Models, trained on the CAMELS simulation suite, to bridge the gap between computationally inexpensive dark matter simulations and the galaxy distributions of more costly hydrodynamic simulations. Our method not only outperforms traditional HOD techniques in accuracy but also significantly accelerates the simulation process, offering a scalable solution for next-generation cosmological surveys. This advancement has the potential to revolutionize galaxy catalog generation, enabling more precise, data-driven cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Young O-rich Stars Migrated from the Outer Disc: Imprints of Sagittarius Accretion Event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way underwent significant transformations in its early history, characterised by violent mergers and satellite galaxy accretion. However, recent observations reveal notable star formation events over the past 4 Gyr, likely triggered by perturbations from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Here, we present chemical signatures of this accretion event, using the [Fe/H] and [O/Fe] ratios of thin disc stars. In the normalised age-metallicity plane, we identify a discontinuous V-shape structure at z$_{\rm max}$ $&lt;$ 0.4 kpc in the local disc, interrupted by a star formation burst between 4 and 2 Gyr ago. This event is characterized by a significant increase in oxygen abundance, resulting in a distinct [O/Fe] gradient and the formation of young O-rich stars. These stars have larger birth radii, indicating formation in the outer disc followed by radial migration to the Solar neighbourhood. Simulations of late satellite infall suggest that the passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy may have contributed to the observed increase in oxygen abundance in the local disc.</description>

      <title>Star formation beyond galaxies: widespread in-situ formation of intra-cluster stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fraction of the intra-cluster light (ICL) formed in-situ in the three most massive clusters of the TNG50 simulation, with virial masses $\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find that a significant fraction of ICL stars ($8\%$-$28\%$) are born in-situ. This amounts to a total stellar mass comparable to the central galaxy itself. Contrary to simple expectations, only a sub-dominant fraction of these in-situ ICL stars are born in the central regions and later re-distributed to more energetic orbits during mergers. Instead, many in-situ ICL stars form directly hundreds of kiloparsecs away from the central galaxy, in clouds condensing out of the circum-cluster medium. The simulations predict a present-date diffuse star formation rate of $\sim$1 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$/yr, with higher rates at higher redshifts. The diffuse star forming component of the ICL is filamentary in nature, extends for hundreds of kiloparsecs and traces the distribution of neutral gas in the cluster host halo. We discuss briefly how numerical details of the baryonic treatment in the simulation, in particular the density threshold for star formation and the equation of state, may play a role in this result. We conclude that a sensitivity of $1.6 \times 10^{-19} - 2.6 \times 10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ in H$_\alpha$ flux (beyond current observational capabilities) would be necessary to detect this diffuse star-forming component in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>A hidden active galactic nucleus powering bright [O III] nebulae in a protocluster at $z=4.5$ revealed by JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy protoclusters are sites of rapid growth, with a high density of massive galaxies driving elevated rates of star formation and accretion onto supermassive black holes. Here, we present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the J1000+0234 group at $z=4.54$, a dense region of a protocluster hosting a massive, dusty star forming galaxy (DSFG). The new data reveal two extended, high-equivalent-width (EW$_0&gt;1000\r{A}$) [O III] nebulae that appear at both sides of the DSFG along its minor axis (namely O3-N and O3-S). On one hand, the spectrum of O3-N shows a broad and blueshifted component with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1300 km/s, suggesting an outflow origin. On the other hand, O3-S stretches over 8.6 kpc, and has a velocity gradient that spans 800 km/s, but shows no evidence of a broad component. However, both sources seem to be powered by an active galactic nucleus (AGN), so we classified them as extended emission-line regions (EELRs). The strongest evidence comes from the detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] $\lambda 3427$ line toward O3-N, which paired with the lack of hard X-rays implies an obscuring column density above the Compton-thick regime. The [Ne V] line is not detected in O3-S, but we measure a He II $\lambda 4687$/H$\beta$=0.25, which is well above the expectation for star formation. Despite the remarkable alignment of O3-N and O3-S with two radio sources, we do not find evidence of shocks from a radio jet that could be powering the EELRs. We interpret this as O3-S being externally irradiated by the AGN, akin to the famous Hanny's Voorwerp object in the local Universe. In addition, classical line ratio diagnostics (e.g., [O III]/H$\beta$ vs [N II]/H$\alpha$) put the DSFG itself in the AGN region of the diagrams, and therefore suggest it to be the most probable AGN host. These results showcase the ability of JWST to unveil obscured AGN at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>A determination of the cosmic microwave background temperature using Galactic molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new, reliable determination of the CN excitation temperature of diffuse molecular clouds in the Milky Way, based on ultra high spectral resolution observations. Our determination is based on CN $B^{2}\Sigma^{+}-X^{2}\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0) vibronic absorption spectra seen along the lines of sight to eight bright Galactic stars. Our analysis is conducted blind, and we account for multiple sources of systematic uncertainty. Like previous studies, our excitation temperature measures exhibit an intrinsic scatter that exceeds the quoted uncertainties. Accounting for this scatter, we derive a 3% determination of the typical CN excitation temperature, $T_{01}=2.769^{+0.084}_{-0.072}~{\rm K}$, which is consistent with the direct determination of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We also perform a single joint fit to all sightlines, and find that our data can be simultaneously fit with an excitation temperature $T_{01}=2.725\pm0.015~{\rm K}$ -- a 0.55% measure that is consistent with the CMB temperature. We propose a future observational strategy to reduce systematic uncertainties and firmly test the limitations of using CN as a cosmic microwave background thermometer.</description>

      <title>Capturing Turbulence with Numerical Dissipation: a Simple Dynamical Model for Unresolved Turbulence in Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can improve the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent structure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white dwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar medium, and non-thermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We present a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic simulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and modeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the generic property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a rate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of fluid viscosity regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We calibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence simulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces multiple non-trivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the temporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on spatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between subgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an example of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk simulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the subresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model performs comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade is described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to implement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations as it utilizes already existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation in such codes.</description>

      <title>The VANDELS Survey: Star formation and quenching in two over-densities at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Understanding galaxy evolution in dense environments, particularly proto-clusters, is crucial for studying mechanisms driving star formation and quenching. Aims: This study examines how two proto-cluster over-densities at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4 impact star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and morphology, focusing on quenched galaxies. Methods: We identified proto-cluster over-densities in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) regions of the VANDELS survey. Using spectral energy distribution analysis, Bayesian methods (BEAGLE and BAGPIPES) helped derive best-fit parameters and U-V and V-J rest-frame colours (UVJ), classifying galaxies as quenched or star-forming based on UVJ diagrams and specific star formation rates (sSFR). TNG300 simulations aided interpretation. Results: Two of 13 proto-cluster over-densities host quenched galaxies with red U-V colours, low sSFR, and properties like massive passive galaxies. These quenched members are redder, older, more massive, and more compact. The highest-density peaks at z=3.55 and z=3.43 have dark matter halo masses consistent with proto-clusters and host AGNs, with five and three AGNs, respectively. Compared to field galaxies, these quenched members are in denser environments. TNG300 simulations suggest proto-clusters with quenched galaxies at high redshift evolve to contain more passive galaxies by z=1. Conclusions: The over-densities host massive quenched galaxies and AGNs in their densest peaks. Simulations reveal that sSFR for passive galaxies in proto-clusters was high at z=6, with median mass growth rates of 96% from z=6 to z=3. Conditions for mass assembly likely involve galaxy interactions and high gas accretion in dense environments. Black hole growth and AGN feedback appear to drive quenching at z=3, aligning with the properties of quenched galaxies observed in our study.</description>

      <title>Stability of plasmas through magnetic helicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic helicity, and more broadly magnetic field line topology, impose constraints on the plasma dynamics. Helically interlocked magnetic rings are in a non-trivial topological state. It is harder to bring them into a topologically trivial state than two rings that are not linked. This particular restriction has the consequence that helical plasmas exhibit increased stability in laboratory devices, in the Sun and in the intergalactic medium. Here we discuss how a magnetic field is stabilizing the plasma and preventing it from disruption by the presence of magnetic helicity. We present observational results, numerical experiments and analytical results that illustrate how helical magnetic fields strongly contribute to the long-term stability of some plasmas. We discuss several cases, such as that of solar corona, toroidal fusion devices, the galactic and extragalactic medium, with a special emphasis on extragalactic bubbles.</description>

      <title>Predicting Interstellar Object Chemodynamics with Gaia</title>

Abstract: The interstellar object population of the Milky Way is a product of its stars. However, what is in fact a complex structure in the Solar neighbourhood has traditionally in ISO studies been described as smoothly distributed. Using a debiased stellar population derived from the Gaia DR3 stellar sample, we predict that the velocity distribution of ISOs is far more textured than a smooth Gaussian. The moving groups caused by Galactic resonances dominate the distribution. 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have entirely normal places within these distributions; 1I is within the non-coeval moving group that includes the Matariki (Pleiades) cluster, and 2I within the Coma Berenices moving group. We show that for the composition of planetesimals formed beyond the ice line, these velocity structures also have a chemodynamic component. This variation will be visible on the sky. We predict that this richly textured distribution will be differentiable from smooth Gaussians in samples that are within the expected discovery capacity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Solar neighbourhood ISOs will be of all ages and come from a dynamic mix of many different populations of stars, reflecting their origins from all around the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Binaries Embedded Within Common Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple star-systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This letter examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single object case. We find that for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to be disrupted by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple star-systems.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances with JWST. II. I-band Measurements in a Sample of Hosts of 10 SN Ia Match HST Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble Tension, a &gt;5 sigma discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W-F150W) TRGB distances to 8 hosts of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 28 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, NGC 5643, and NGC 5861. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1 sigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic crosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder.</description>
