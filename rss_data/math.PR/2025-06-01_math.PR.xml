      <title>Large deviations for light-tailed L\'evy bridges on short time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L = (L(t))_{t\geq 0}$ be a multivariate L\'evy process with L\'evy measure $\nu(dy) = \exp(-f(|y|)) dy$ for a smoothly regularly varying function $f$ of index $\alpha&gt;1$. The process $L$ is renormalized as $X^\varepsilon(t) = \varepsilon L(r_\varepsilon t)$, $t\in [0, T]$, for a scaling parameter $r_\varepsilon= o(\varepsilon^{-1})$, as $\varepsilon \to 0$. We study the behavior of the bridge $Y^{\varepsilon, x}$ of the renormalized process $X^\varepsilon$ conditioned on the event $X^\varepsilon(T) = x$ for a given end point $x\neq 0$ and end time $T&gt;0$ in the regime of small $\varepsilon$. Our main result is a sample path large deviations principle (LDP) for $Y^{\varepsilon, x}$ with a specific speed function $S(\varepsilon)$ and an entropy-type rate function $I_{x}$ on the Skorokhod space in the limit $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0+$. We show that the asymptotic energy minimizing path of $Y^{\varepsilon, x}$ is the linear parametrization of the straight line between $0$ and $x$, while all paths leaving this set are exponentially negligible. We also infer a LDP for the asymptotic number of jumps and establish asymptotic normality of the jump increments of $Y^{\varepsilon, x}$. Since on these short time scales $r_\varepsilon = o(\varepsilon^{-1})$) direct LDP methods cannot be adapted we use an alternative direct approach based on convolution density estimates of the marginals $X^{\varepsilon}(t)$, $t\in [0, T]$,for which we solve a specific nonlinear functional equation.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions of Navier-Stokes Equation with purely discontinuous L\'evy Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of weak martingale solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations driven by pure jump L\'evy processes. Our proof consists of two parts. In the first one, mostly classical, we recall a priori estimates, from the paper by the third named author, for solutions to suitable constructed Galerkin approximations and we use the Jakubowski-Skorokhod Theorem to find a sequence of processes on a new probability space convergent point-wise to a limit process. In the second one, we show that the limit process is a weak martingale solution to the SNSEs by using an approach of Kallianpur and Xiong. The core of this method consists of a proof that a certain natural process on the new probability space is a purely discontinuous martingale and then to use a suitable representation theorem. In this way we propose a method of proving solutions to stochastic PDEs which is different from the method used recently by the first and fourth named author in their joint paper with E.\ Hausenblas, see \cite{Brz+Haus+Raza_2018_reaction_diffusion}.</description>

      <title>Sharp Concentration of Simple Random Tensors II: Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes sharp concentration inequalities for simple random tensors. Our theory unveils a phenomenon that arises only for asymmetric tensors of order $p \ge 3:$ when the effective ranks of the covariances of the component random variables lie on both sides of a critical threshold, an additional logarithmic factor emerges that is not present in sharp bounds for symmetric tensors. To establish our results, we develop empirical process theory for products of $p$ different function classes evaluated at $p$ different random variables, extending generic chaining techniques for quadratic and product empirical processes to higher-order settings.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the limiting critical Potts measures on locally regular-tree-like expander graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any integers $d,q\ge 3$, we consider the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model with an external field on a sequence of expander graphs that converges to the $d$-regular tree $\mathtt{T}_d$ in the Benjamini-Schramm sense. We show that along the critical line, any subsequential local weak limit of the Potts measures is a mixture of the free and wired Potts Gibbs measures on $\mathtt{T}_d$. Furthermore, we show the possibility of an arbitrary extent of strong phase coexistence: for any $\alpha\in [0,1]$, there exists a sequence of locally $\mathtt{T}_d$-like expander graphs $\{G_n\}$, such that the Potts measures on $\{G_n\}$ locally weakly converges to the $(\alpha,1-\alpha)$-mixture of the free and wired Potts Gibbs measures. Our result extends results of \cite{HJP23} which restrict to the zero-field case and also require $q$ to be sufficiently large relative to $d$, and results of \cite{BDS23} which restrict to the even $d$ case. We also confirm the phase coexistence prediction of \cite{BDS23}, asserting that the Potts local weak limit is a genuine mixture of the free and wired states in a generic setting. We further characterize the subsequential local weak limits of random cluster measures on such graph sequences, for any cluster parameter $q&gt;2$ (not necessarily integer).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic version of the parametrix method for Markov chains converging to diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a generalization of the local limit theorem on the convergence of inhomogeneous Markov chains to the diffusion limit for the case where the corresponding process coefficients satisfy weak regularity conditions and coincide only asymptotically. In particular, the drift coefficients considered by us can be unbounded with at most linear growth, and the estimates reflect the transfer of the terminal state by an unbounded trend through the corresponding deterministic flow. Our approach is based on the study of the uniform distance between the transition densities of a given inhomogeneous Markov chain and the limit diffusion process, and the convergence rate estimate is obtained using the classical local limit theorem and parametrix-type stability estimates.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the harmonic descent chain and applications to critical beta-splitting trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the connection to a probabilistic model of phylogenetic trees introduced by Aldous, we study the recursive sequence governed by the rule $x_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{h_{n-1}(n-i)} x_i$ where $h_{n-1} = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1/j$, known as the harmonic descent chain. While it is known that this sequence converges to an explicit limit $x$, not much is known about the rate of convergence. We first show that a class of recursive sequences including the above are decreasing and use this to bound the rate of convergence. Moreover, for the harmonic descent chain we prove the asymptotic $x_n - x = n^{-\gamma_* + o(1)}$ for an implicit exponent $\gamma_*$. As a consequence, we deduce central limit theorems for various statistics of the critical beta-splitting random tree. This answers a number of questions of Aldous, Janson, and Pittel.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear PDEs with modulated dispersion IV: normal form approach and unconditional uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modulated Korteweg-de~Vries equation (KdV) on the circle with a time non-homogeneous modulation acting on the linear dispersion term. By adapting the normal form approach to the modulated setting, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of solutions to the modulated KdV in $L^2(\mathbb T)$ if a modulation is sufficiently irregular. For example, this result implies that if the modulation is given by a sample path of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $0 &lt; H &lt; \frac 25$, the modulated KdV on the circle is unconditionally well-posed in $L^2(\mathbb T)$. Our normal form approach provides the construction of solutions to the modulated KdV (and the associated nonlinear Young integral) {\it without} assuming any positive regularity in time. As an interesting byproduct of our normal form approach, we extend the construction of the nonlinear Young integral to a much larger class of functions, and obtain an improved Euler approximation scheme as compared to the classical sewing lemma approach. We also establish analogous sharp unconditional uniqueness results for the modulated Benjamin-Ono equation and the modulated derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a quadratic nonlinearity. In the appendix, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of the cubic modulated NLS on the circle in $H^{\frac 16}(\mathbb T)$.</description>

Abstract: In a seminal paper (1996), Bourgain proved invariance of the Gibbs measure for the defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the two-dimensional torus by constructing local-in-time solutions in a probabilistic manner.

      <title>Equilibrium Distribution for t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding with Generalized Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a well-known algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data by finding low-dimensional representations. In this paper, we study the convergence of t-SNE with generalized kernels and extend the results of Auffinger and Fletcher in 2023. Our work starts by giving a concrete formulation of generalized input and output kernels. Then we prove that under certain conditions, the t-SNE algorithm converges to an equilibrium distribution for a wide range of input and output kernels as the number of data points diverges.</description>

      <title>Provably convergent stochastic fixed-point algorithm for free-support Wasserstein barycenter of continuous non-parametric measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a provably convergent algorithm for approximating the 2-Wasserstein barycenter of continuous non-parametric probability measures. Our algorithm is inspired by the fixed-point iterative scheme of \'Alvarez-Esteban et al. (2016) whose convergence to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter relies on obtaining exact optimal transport (OT) maps. However, typically in practice, OT maps are only approximately computed and exact computation of OT maps between continuous probability measures is only tractable for certain restrictive parametric families. To circumvent the need to compute exact OT maps between general non-parametric measures, we develop a tailored iterative scheme that utilizes consistent estimators of the OT maps instead of the exact OT maps. This gives rise to a computationally tractable stochastic fixed-point algorithm which is provably convergent to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter. Our algorithm remarkably does not restrict the support of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter to be any fixed finite set and can be implemented in a distributed computing environment, which makes it suitable for large-scale data aggregation problems. In our numerical experiments, we propose a method of generating non-trivial instances of 2-Wasserstein barycenter problems where the ground-truth barycenter measure is known. Our numerical results showcase the capability of our algorithm in developing high-quality approximations of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter, as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art methods based on generative neural networks in terms of accuracy, stability, and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a version of the Watts cascade model on directed multiplex configuration model networks, and present a detailed analysis of the cascade size, single-seed cascade probability and cascade condition. We then introduce a smaller class of network models that we call constrained multiplex networks, which allows us to induce patterns in the node activity, i.e. in the participation of nodes on different layers. We find that the choice of induced patterns affects the phase transitions of the cascade model in a variety of ways.</description>

      <title>Geometric Littlewood-Offord problems via lattice point counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider nonzero vectors $a_{1},\dots,a_{n}\in\mathbb{C}^{k}$, independent Rademacher random variables $\xi_{1},\dots,\xi_{n}$, and a set $S\subseteq\mathbb{C}^{k}$. What upper bounds can we prove on the probability that the random sum $\xi_{1}a_{1}+\dots+\xi_{n}a_{n}$ lies in $S$? We develop a general framework that allows us to reduce problems of this type to counting lattice points in $S$. We apply this framework with known results from diophantine geometry to prove various bounds when $S$ is a set of points in convex position, an algebraic variety, or a semialgebraic set. In particular, this resolves conjectures of Fox-Kwan-Spink and Kwan-Sauermann.
  We also obtain some corollaries for the polynomial Littlewood-Offord problem, for polynomials that have bounded Chow rank (i.e., can be written as a polynomial of a bounded number of linear forms). For example, one of our results confirms a conjecture of Nguyen and Vu in the special case of polynomials with bounded Chow rank: if a bounded-degree polynomial $F\in\mathbb{C}[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]$ has bounded Chow rank and ''robustly depends on at least $b$ of its variables'', then $\mathbb{P}[F(\xi_{1},\dots,\xi_{n})=0]\le O(1/\sqrt{b})$. We also prove significantly stronger bounds when $F$ is ''robustly irreducible'', towards a conjecture of Costello.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Even Subgraph and Its Connection to Phase Transitions of Graphical Representations of the Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniform even subgraph is intimately related to the Ising model, the random-cluster model, the random current model, and the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model. In this paper, we first prove that the uniform even subgraph of $Z^d$ percolates for $d \geq 2$ using its characterisation as the Haar measure on the group of even graphs. We then tighten the result by showing that the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model on $Z^d$ percolates for $d \geq 2$ for edge-weights $x$ lying in some interval $(1-\varepsilon,1]$. Finally, our main theorem is that the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model and random current models corresponding to a supercritical Ising model are always at least critical, in the sense that their two-point correlation functions decay at most polynomially and the expected cluster sizes are infinite.</description>

      <title>Functional weak convergence of stochastic integrals for moving averages and continuous-time random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an extensive theory of weak convergence for moving averages and continuous-time random walks (CTRWs) with respect to Skorokhod's M1 and J1 topologies. Here we address the fundamental question of how this translates into functional limit theorems in the M1 or J1 topology for stochastic integrals driven by these processes. As an important application, we provide weak approximation results for general SDEs driven by time-changed L\'evy processes. Such SDEs and their associated fractional Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations are central to models of anomalous diffusion in statistical physics. Our results yield a rigorous functional characterisation of these as continuum limits of the underlying models driven by CTRWs. With regard to strictly M1 convergent moving averages and correlated CTRWs, it turns out that the convergence of stochastic integrals can fail decidedly and fundamental new challenges arise compared to the J1 setting. Nevertheless, we identify natural classes of integrand processes for which there is M1 convergence of the stochastic integrals. We also show that these results are flexible enough to yield functional limit theorems in the M1 topology for certain stochastic delay differential equations driven by moving averages.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we will consider the contact process in a very simple type of random environment that physicists call the random dilution model. We start with the contact process on a graph, here either $\mathbb{Z}^d$, a $d$-dimensional torus or an \ER graph, and then flip independent $(1-p)$ coins to delete edges, or delete vertices. Let $p^*$ be the threshold for percolation in the diluted graph. We will primarily be concerned with two phenomena. (i) The critical value for the contact process on the dliuted graph $\lambda_c(p)$ does not converge to $\infty$ as $p \downarrow p^*$. (ii) In contrast to the contact process on a homogeneous graph, the density of 1's starting from all sites occupied converges to 0 at a polynomial rate when $p&lt;p^*$ (the ``Griffiths phase'') and like $c/(\log t)^a$ when $p=p^*$.</description>

      <title>Constrained-degree percolation on the hypercubic lattice: uniqueness and some of its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the constrained-degree percolation (CDP) model on the hypercubic lattice. This is a continuous-time percolation model defined by a sequence $(U_e)_{e\in\mathcal{E}^d}$ of i.i.d. uniform random variables and a positive integer $k$, referred to as the constraint. The model evolves as follows: each edge $e$ attempts to open at a random time $U_e$, independently of all other edges. It succeeds if, at time $U_e$, both of its end-vertices have degrees strictly smaller than $k$. It is known \cite{hartarsky2022weakly} that this model undergoes a phase transition when $d\geq3$ for most nontrivial values of $k$. In this work, we prove that, for any fixed constraint, the number of infinite clusters at any time $t\in[0,1)$ is almost surely either 0 or 1. This uniqueness result implies the continuity of the percolation function in the supercritical regime, $t\in(t_c,1)$, where $t_c$ denotes the percolation critical threshold. The proof relies on a key time-regularity property of the model: the law of the process is continuous with respect to time for local events. In fact, we establish differentiability in time, thereby extending the result of \cite{SSS} to the CDP setting.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE(0) and classical Calogero-Sutherland System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this second of two articles, we study the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems as the deterministic limits of the random multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems. We construct the multiple radial SLE(0) systems from stationary relations by heuristically taking the limit of partition functions as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the boundary points $\{z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n\}$. The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. In the deterministic case of $\kappa=0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity form a special class of classical Calogero-Sutherland systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse generating functions for trees and for connected subgraphs on the complete graph, and identify a single scaling profile which applies for both generating functions in a critical window. Our motivation comes from the analysis of the finite-size scaling of lattice trees and lattice animals on a high-dimensional discrete torus, for which we conjecture that the identical profile applies in dimensions $d \ge 8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study log-correlated Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with weakly interacting focusing quartic potentials whose coupling constants tend to $0$ as we remove regularization. In particular, we exhibit a phase transition for this model by identifying a critical threshold, separating the weakly and strongly coupling regimes; in the weakly coupling regime, we show that the frequency-truncated measures converge to the base Gaussian measure (possibly with a renormalized $L^2$-cutoff), whereas, in the strongly coupling regime, we prove non-convergence of the frequency-truncated measures, even up to a subsequence. Our result answers an open question posed by Brydges and Slade (1996).</description>

      <title>The supercritical phase of the $\varphi^4$ model is well behaved</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we analyse the $\varphi^4$ model on $\mathbb Z^d$ in the supercritical regime $\beta &gt; \beta_c$. We consider a random cluster representation of the $\varphi^4$ model, which corresponds to an Ising random cluster model on a random environment. We prove that the supercritical phase of this percolation model on $\mathbb Z^d$ ($d\geq 2$) is well behaved in the sense that, for every $\beta&gt;\beta_c$, local uniqueness of macroscopic clusters occurs with high probability, uniformly in the boundary conditions. This result provides the basis for renormalisation techniques used to study several fine properties of the supercritical phase. As applications, we prove surface order exponential bounds for the (lower) large deviations of the empirical magnetisation as well as for the spectral gaps of dynamical $\varphi^4$ models in the entire supercritical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions implying that the product of $m\geq 2$ Poisson functionals, living in a finite sum of Wiener chaoses, is square-integrable. Our conditions are expressed in terms of iterated add-one cost operators, and are obtained through the use of a novel family of Poincar\'e inequalities for almost surely finite random variables, generalizing the recent findings by Trauthwein (2024). When specialized to the case of multiple Wiener-It\^o integrals, our results yield general multiplication formulae on the Poisson space under minimal conditions, naturally expressed in terms of partitions and diagrams. Our work addresses several questions left open in a seminal work by Surgailis (1984), and completes a line of research initiated in D\"obler and Peccati (2018).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems of type $(n, m)$ for positive integers $n$ and $m$ with $m \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$, extending the construction of~\cite{ABKM20} beyond the previously studied case $n = 2m$.
  By applying integrals of motion associated with the Loewner evolution, we show that, in the $\mathbb{H}$-uniformization with the marked point $q = \infty$, the traces of type $(n, m)$ multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems correspond to the real locus of real rational functions with $n$ real simple critical points, $m$ simple poles, and a pole of order $n - 2m + 1$ at infinity.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that, under a common capacity parametrization, the Loewner dynamics evolve according to the classical Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>On the deep-water and shallow-water limits of the intermediate long wave equation from a statistical viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study convergence problems for the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), with the depth parameter $\delta &gt; 0$, in the deep-water limit ($\delta \to \infty$) and the shallow-water limit ($\delta \to 0$) from a statistical point of view. In particular, we establish convergence of invariant Gibbs dynamics for ILW in both the deep-water and shallow-water limits. For this purpose, we first construct the Gibbs measures for ILW, $0 &lt; \delta &lt; \infty$. As they are supported on distributions, a renormalization is required. With the Wick renormalization, we carry out the construction of the Gibbs measures for ILW. We then prove that the Gibbs measures for ILW converge in total variation to that for the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit. In the shallow-water regime, after applying a scaling transformation, we prove that, as $\delta \to 0$, the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW converge weakly to that for the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). We point out that this second result is of particular interest since the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW and KdV are mutually singular (whereas the Gibbs measures for ILW and BO are equivalent).
  We also discuss convergence of the associated dynamical problem.
  Lastly, we point out that our results also apply to the generalized ILW equation in the defocusing case, converging to the generalized BO in the deep-water limit and to the generalized KdV in the shallow-water limit. In the non-defocusing case, however, our results can not be extended to a nonlinearity with a higher power due to the non-normalizability of the corresponding Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Mixing time of the conditional backward sampling particle filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conditional backward sampling particle filter (CBPF) is a powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for general state space hidden Markov model (HMM) smoothing. It was proposed as an improvement over the conditional particle filter (CPF), which is known to have an $O(T^2)$ computational time complexity under a general `strong' mixing assumption, where $T$ is the time horizon. While there is empirical evidence of the superiority of the CBPF over the CPF in practice, this has never been theoretically quantified. We show that the CBPF has $O(T \log T)$ time complexity under strong mixing. In particular, the CBPF's mixing time is upper bounded by $O(\log T)$, for any sufficiently large number of particles $N$ that depends only on the mixing assumptions and not $T$. We also show that an $O(\log T)$ mixing time is optimal. To prove our main result, we introduce a novel coupling of two CBPFs, which employs a maximal coupling of two particle systems at each time instant. As the coupling is implementable, it thus has practical applications. We use it to construct unbiased, finite variance, estimates of functionals which have arbitrary dependence on the latent state's path, with a total expected cost of $O(T \log T)$. As the specific application to real-data analysis, we construct unbiased estimates of the HMM's score function, leading to stochastic gradient maximum likelihood estimation of a financial time-series model. Finally, we also investigate other couplings and show that some of these alternatives can have improved empirical behaviour.</description>

      <title>A Generalization Result for Convergence in Learning-to-Optimize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-to-optimize leverages machine learning to accelerate optimization algorithms. While empirical results show tremendous improvements compared to classical optimization algorithms, theoretical guarantees are mostly lacking, such that the outcome cannot be reliably assured. Especially, convergence is hardly studied in learning-to-optimize, because conventional convergence guarantees in optimization are based on geometric arguments, which cannot be applied easily to learned algorithms. Thus, we develop a probabilistic framework that resembles classical optimization and allows for transferring geometric arguments into learning-to-optimize. Based on our new proof-strategy, our main theorem is a generalization result for parametric classes of potentially non-smooth, non-convex loss functions and establishes the convergence of learned optimization algorithms to critical points with high probability. This effectively generalizes the results of a worst-case analysis into a probabilistic framework, and frees the design of the learned algorithm from using safeguards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a powerful and general method to provide rigorous and accurate upper and lower bounds for Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows. Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system and work under mild hypoellipticity conditions and outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far out of reach from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of four different systems. Finally, we show the robustness of our approach by combining it with continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents over large parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Robust random graph matching in Gaussian models via vector approximate message passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the matching recovery problem between a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices with a latent vertex correspondence. We are particularly interested in a robust version of this problem such that our observation is a perturbed input $(A+E,B+F)$ where $(A,B)$ is a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices and $E,F$ are adversarially chosen matrices supported on an unknown $\epsilon n * \epsilon n$ principle minor of $A,B$, respectively. We propose a vector approximate message passing (vector AMP) algorithm that succeeds in polynomial time as long as the correlation $\rho$ between $(A,B)$ is a non-vanishing constant and $\epsilon = o\big( \tfrac{1}{(\log n)^{20}} \big)$.
  The main methodological inputs for our result are the iterative random graph matching algorithm proposed in \cite{DL22+, DL23+} and the spectral cleaning procedure proposed in \cite{IS24+}. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first efficient random graph matching type algorithm that is robust under any adversarial perturbations of $n^{1-o(1)}$ size.</description>

      <title>Journey from the Wilson exact RG towards the Wegner-Morris Fokker-Planck RG and the Carosso field-coarsening via Langevin stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Wilson RG of 'incomplete integration' as a function of the effective RG-time $t$, the non-linear differential RG-flow for the energy $E_t[\phi(.)]$ translates for the probability distribution $P_t[\phi(.)] \sim e^{- E_t[\phi(.)]} $ into the linear Fokker-Planck RG-flow associated to independent non-identical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the Fourier modes. The corresponding Langevin stochastic differential equations for the real-space field $\phi_t(\vec x)$ have been recently interpreted by Carosso as genuine infinitesimal coarsening-transformations that are the analog of spin-blocking, and whose irreversible character is essential to overcome the paradox of the naive description of the Wegner-Morris Continuity-Equation for the RG-flow as a meaningless infinitesimal change of variables in the partition function integral. This interpretation suggests to consider new RG-schemes, in particular the Carosso RG where the Langevin SDE corresponds to the stochastic heat equation also known as the Edwards-Wilkinson dynamics. After a pedestrian self-contained introduction to this stochastic formulation of RG-flows, we focus on the case where the field theory is defined on the large volume $L^d$ with periodic boundary conditions, in order to distinguish between extensive and intensives observables while keeping the translation-invariance. Since the empirical magnetization $m_e \equiv \frac{1}{L^d} \int_{L^d} d^d \vec x \ \phi(\vec x) $ is an intensive variable corresponding to the zero-momentum Fourier coefficient of the field, its probability distribution $p_L(m_e)$ can be obtained from the gradual integration over all the other Fourier coefficients associated to non-vanishing-momenta via an appropriate adaptation of the Carosso stochastic RG, in order to obtain the large deviation properties with respect to the volume $L^d$.</description>

Abstract: Robots rely on motion planning to navigate safely and efficiently while performing various tasks. In this paper, we investigate motion planning through Bayesian inference, where motion plans are inferred based on planning objectives and constraints. However, existing Bayesian motion planning methods often struggle to explore low-probability regions of the planning space, where high-quality plans may reside. To address this limitation, we propose the use of heavy-tailed distributions -- specifically, Student's-$t$ distributions -- to enhance probabilistic inferential search for motion plans. We develop a novel sequential single-pass smoothing approach that integrates Student's-$t$ distribution with Monte Carlo sampling. A special case of this approach is ensemble Kalman smoothing, which depends on short-tailed Gaussian distributions. We validate the proposed approach through simulations in autonomous vehicle motion planning, demonstrating its superior performance in planning, sampling efficiency, and constraint satisfaction compared to ensemble Kalman smoothing. While focused on motion planning, this work points to the broader potential of heavy-tailed distributions in enhancing probabilistic decision-making in robotics.</description>
