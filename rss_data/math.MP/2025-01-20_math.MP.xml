      <title>A Proof of Lieb--Wehrl Entropy conjecture for $SU(N,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sharp functional inequalities for the coherent state transforms of $SU(N,1)$. These inequalities are rooted in Wehrl's definition of semiclassical entropy and his conjecture about its minimum value. Lieb resolved this conjecture in 1978, posing a similar question for Bloch coherent states of $SU(2)$. The $SU(2)$ conjecture was settled by Lieb and Solovej in 2014, and the conjecture was extended for a wide class of Lie groups. The generalized Lieb conjecture has been resolved for several Lie groups, including $SU(N),\, N\geq2$, $SU(1,1)$, and its $AX+B$ subgroup. With sharp functional inequalities for the coherent state transforms of the group $SU(N,1)$, we confirm this Lieb-Wehrl entropy conjecture for $SU(N,1),\, N\geq2$. Additionally, we explore the Faber-Krahn inequality, which applies to the short-time Fourier transform with a Gaussian window. This inequality was previously proven by Nicola and Tilli and later extended by Ramos and Tilli to the wavelet transform. In this paper, we further extend this result within the framework of the Bergman space $\mathcal A_{\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>Stability of the $\pi$-Flux Phase for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled to Fermionic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Ising gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter. In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase, associated with magnetic flux equal to $\pi$ in every elementary lattice plaquette, provided the fermionic hopping is large enough. This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography from the evolution of a single expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of performing full quantum tomography based on the homogeneous time evolution of a single expectation value. For example, we find that every non-trivial binary measurement evolved by any quantum channel, except for a null set, in principle enables full quantum state tomography. While this remains true when restricted to Lindblad semigroups, we show that beyond the qubit case unitary evolution is never sufficient - so the presence of noise is essential. We prove an analog of Takens' embedding theorem for quantum channels, which extends our findings to cases where prior information is available, and we provide estimation bounds for finite statistics.</description>

      <title>The $q$-Racah polynomials from scalar products of Bethe states II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of Leonard triples is applied to the derivation of normalized scalar products of on-shell and off-shell Bethe states generated from a Leonard pair. The scalar products take the form of linear combinations of $q$-Racah polynomials with coefficients depending on the off-shell parameters. Upon specializations, explicit solutions for the corresponding Belliard-Slavnov linear systems are obtained. It implies the existence of a determinant formula in terms of inhomogeneous Bethe roots for the $q$-Racah polynomials. Also, a set of relations that determines solutions (Bethe roots) of the corresponding Bethe equations of inhomogeneous type in terms of solutions of Bethe equations of homogenous type is obtained.</description>

      <title>Scattering, Polyhomogeneity and Asymptotics for Quasilinear Wave Equations From Past to Future Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general construction of semiglobal scattering solutions to quasilinear wave equations in a neighbourhood of spacelike infinity including past and future null infinity, where the scattering data are posed on an ingoing null cone and along past null infinity. More precisely, we prove weighted, optimal-in-decay energy estimates and propagation of polyhomogeneity statements from past to future null infinity for these solutions, we provide an algorithmic procedure how to compute the precise coefficients in the arising polyhomogeneous expansions, and we apply this procedure to various examples. As a corollary, our results directly imply the summability in the spherical harmonic number $\ell$ of the estimates proved for fixed spherical harmonic modes in the papers [Keh22b,KM24] from the series "The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity".
  Our (physical space) methods are based on weighted energy estimates near spacelike infinity similar to those of [HV23], commutations with (modified) scaling vector fields to remove leading order terms in the relevant expansions, time inversions, as well as the Minkowskian conservation laws: $$
  \partial_u(r^{-2\ell}\partial_v(r^2\partial_v)^{\ell}(r\phi_{\ell}))=0, $$ which are satisfied if $\Box_\eta\phi=0$. Our scattering constructions go beyond the usual class of finite energy solutions and, as a consequence, can be applied directly to the Einstein vacuum equations in harmonic gauge.</description>

      <title>Soliton methods and the black hole balance problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is an extended version of a presentation given at KOZWaves 2024: The 6th Australasian Conference on Wave Science, held in Dunedin, New Zealand.
  Soliton methods were initially introduced to study equations such as the Korteweg--de Vries equation, which describes nonlinear water waves. Interestingly, the same methods can also be used to analyse equilibrium configurations in general relativity. An intriguing open problem is whether a relativistic $n$-body system can be in stationary equilibrium. Due to the nonlinear effect of spin-spin repulsion of rotating objects, and possibly considering charged bodies with additional electromagnetic repulsion, the existence of such unusual configurations remains a possibility. An important example is a (hypothetical) equilibrium configuration with $n$ aligned black holes. By studying a linear matrix problem equivalent to the Einstein equations for axisymmetric and stationary (electro-) vacuum spacetimes, we derive the most general form of the boundary data on the symmetry axis in terms of a finite number of parameters. In the simplest case $n=1$, this leads to a constructive uniqueness proof of the Kerr (-Newman) solution. For $n=2$ and vacuum, we obtain non-existence of stationary two-black-hole configurations. For $n=2$ with electrovacuum, and for larger $n$, it remains an open problem whether the well-defined finite solution families contain any physically reasonable solutions, i.e.\ spacetimes without anomalies such as naked singularities, magnetic monopoles, and struts.</description>

      <title>Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. By incorporating the effects of Lorentz-violating term $\ell$ and the monopole charge $\eta$ in the KR field, we derive the modified gravitational field equations and analyze the resulting black hole spacetime. The obtained solution exhibits deviations from the Schwarzschild metric with topological defect, as it is influenced by the monopole charge and self-interaction potential. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, revealing novel stability conditions. Additionally, we perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge. Our findings suggest that these parameters have to be significantly small, although there are different constraints imposed by individual tests, ranging from $10^{-9}\leq|\ell|\leq 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-9}\leq\eta\leq 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A state sum for four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum geometry in terms of edge vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of a new state sum model for $4d$ Lorentzian quantum gravity based on the description of quantum simplicial geometry in terms of edge vectors. Quantum states and amplitudes for simplicial geometry are built from irreducible representations of the translation group, then related to the representations of the Lorentz group via expansors, leading to interesting (and intricate) non-commutative structures. We also show how the new model connects to the Lorentzian Barrett-Crane spin foam model, formulated in terms of quantized triangle bivectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the small and large eigenvalues of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator L(q) with a periodic, real and locally integrable potential q. First we explicitly write out the first and second terms of the asymptotic formulas for the large periodic and antiperiodic eigenvalues and illustrate these formulas for the Kronig-Penney model. Then we give estimates for the small periodic and antiperiodic eigenvalues and for the length of the first gaps in the case of the Kronig-Penney model. Moreover, we give error estimations and present a numerical example.</description>

      <title>The time-dependent harmonic oscillator revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out a rather effective approach for solving the time-dependent harmonic oscillator $\ddot q=-\omega^2 q$ under various regularity assumptions. Where $\omega(t )$ is $C^1$ this is reduced to Hamilton equation for the angle variable $\psi$ {\it alone} (the action variable ${\cal I}$ is obtained \it by quadrature}). The fixed point theorem for the integral equation equivalent to the generic Cauchy problem for $\psi(t )$ yields a sequence $\{\psi^{(h)}\}_{h\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ converging to $\psi$ rather fast; if $\omega$ varies slowly or little, already $\psi^{(0)}$ approximates $\psi$ well for rather long time lapses. The discontinuities of $\omega$, if any, determine those of $\psi,{\cal I}$. The zeros of $q,\dot q$ are investigated via Riccati equations. Our approach may simplify the study of: upper and lower bounds on the solutions; the stability of the trivial one; parametric resonance when $\omega(t )$ is periodic; the adiabatic invariance of ${\cal I}$; asymptotic expansions in a slow time parameter $\varepsilon$; time-dependent driven and damped parametric oscillators; etc.</description>

      <title>Direct Interaction Approximation for generalized stochastic models in the turbulence problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to consider the application of the direct interaction approximation (DIA) developed by Kraichnan to generalized stochastic models in the turbulence problem. Previous developments were based on the Boltzmann-Gibbs prescription for the underlying entropy measure, which exhibits the extensivity property and is suited for ergodic systems. Here, we consider the introduction of an influence bias discriminating rare and frequent events explicitly, as it behooves non-ergodic systems, which is dealt with by a using a Tsallis type autocorrelation model with an underlying non-extensive entropy measure. As an example, we consider a linear damped stochastic oscillator system, and describe the resulting stochastic process. The non-perturbative aspects excluded by Keller's perturbative procedure are found to be minimized in the white-noise limit. In the opposite limit, the physical variances between the random process models don't seem to materialize, and the Uhlenbeck-Ornstein and Tsallis type models are found to yield the same result. In the process, we also deduce some apparently novel mathematical properties of the stochastic models associated with the present investigation -- the gamma distribution and the Tsallis non-extensive entropy.</description>

      <title>Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we describe certain pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators, both of which are exactly-solvable models in quantum mechanics. By coupling the dynamics of a particle moving in a one-dimensional potential to an imaginary-valued gauge field, it is possible to obtain certain pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the original (Hermitian) problem. In particular, it is pointed out that the Swanson oscillator arises as such an extension of the quantum harmonic oscillator. For the pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators, we explicitly solve for the wavefunctions in the position representation and also explore their intertwining relations.</description>

      <title>First integrals of some two-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss some results on integrable Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom. We revisit the much-studied problem of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and discuss its (super)integrability in the light of a canonical transformation which can map the anisotropic oscillator to a corresponding isotropic one. Following this, we discuss the computation of first integrals for integrable two-dimensional systems using the framework of the Jacobi last multiplier. Using the latter, we describe some novel physical examples, namely, the classical Landau problem with a scalar-potential-induced hyperbolic mode, the two-dimensional Kepler problem, and a problem involving a linear curl force.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Solutions in Scalar-Tensor theory via the Eisenhart-Duval lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement the Einsenhart-Duval lift in scalar-tensor gravity as a means to construct integrable cosmological models and analytic cosmological solutions. Specifically, we employ a geometric criterion to constrain the free functions of the scalar-tensor theory such that the field equations can be written in the equivalent form of linear equations. This geometric linearization is achieved by the introduction of an extended minisuperspace description. The results are applied to construct analytic solutions in modified theories of gravity such as the $f\left( R\right) $-theory and the hybrid metric-Palatini $f\left( \mathcal{R}\right) $-gravity.</description>
