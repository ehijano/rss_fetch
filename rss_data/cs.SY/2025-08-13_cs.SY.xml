      <title>DeePConverter: A Data-Driven Optimal Control Architecture for Grid-Connected Power Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-connected power converters are ubiquitous in modern power systems, acting as grid interfaces of renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, high-voltage DC systems, etc. Conventionally, power converters use multiple PID regulators to achieve different control objectives such as grid synchronization and voltage/power regulations, where the PID parameters are usually tuned based on a presumed (and often overly-simplified) power grid model. However, this may lead to inferior performance or even instabilities in practice, as the real power grid is highly complex, variable, and generally unknown. To tackle this problem, we employ a data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) to perform data-driven, optimal, and robust control for power converters. We call the converters that are operated in this way \textit{DeePConverters}. A DeePConverter can implicitly perceive the characteristics of the power grid from data and adjust its control strategy to achieve optimal and robust performance. We present the modular configurations, generalized structure, control behavior specification, detailed implementation, and computation of DeePConverters. High-fidelity simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of DeePConverters.</description>

      <title>XR Reality Check: What Commercial Devices Deliver for Spatial Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inaccurate spatial tracking in extended reality (XR) devices leads to virtual object jitter, misalignment, and user discomfort, fundamentally limiting immersive experiences and natural interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel testbed that enables simultaneous, synchronized evaluation of multiple XR devices under identical environmental and kinematic conditions. Leveraging this platform, we present the first comprehensive empirical benchmarking of five state-of-the-art XR devices across 16 diverse scenarios. Our results reveal substantial intra-device performance variation, with individual devices exhibiting up to 101\% increases in error when operating in featureless environments. We also demonstrate that tracking accuracy strongly correlates with visual conditions and motion dynamics. We also observe significant inter-device disparities, with performance differences of up to 2.8$\times$, which are closely linked to hardware specifications such as sensor configurations and dedicated processing units. Finally, we explore the feasibility of substituting a motion capture system with the Apple Vision Pro as a practical ground truth reference. While the Apple Vision Pro delivers highly accurate relative pose error estimates ($R^2 = 0.830$), its absolute pose error estimation remains limited ($R^2 = 0.387$), highlighting both its potential and its constraints for rigorous XR evaluation. This work establishes the first standardized framework for comparative XR tracking evaluation, providing the research community with reproducible methodologies, comprehensive benchmark datasets, and open-source tools that enable systematic analysis of tracking performance across devices and conditions, thereby accelerating the development of more robust spatial sensing technologies for XR systems.</description>

      <title>Architecture and FPGA Implementation of Digital Time-to-Digital Converter for Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many application domains face the challenges of high-power consumption and high computational demands, especially with the advancement in embedded machine learning and edge computing. Designing application-specific circuits is crucial to reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. In these perspectives, this paper presents the design of a Digital Time-to-Digital converter (DTDC) based on multiple delay line topologies. The DTDC is implemented in VHDL for the Xilinx Artix-7 AC701 FPGA device. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the circuit in converting the input period along a wide range up to 1ps. The designed circuit is implemented with less than 1% of the resource utilization on the target FPGA device.</description>

      <title>Smart Residential Community Simulator for Developing and Benchmarking Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) are being actively developed for both individual houses and communities to support demand response in on-grid operation, and ensure resilience during off-grid scenarios. However, most simulators used for closed-loop HEMS testing are tailored to a specific distributed energy resource (DER) configuration with a fixed number of houses, limiting flexibility and scalability. This leads to additional development efforts to support diverse DER configurations across any number of houses and to integrate appropriate weather and load data pipelines. To address these limitations, we present a scalable simulator capable of modeling any number of houses in both on-grid and off-grid modes as a Gymnasium environment. Each house can have a unique DER configuration - Rooftop Solar Photovoltaics (PV), Battery-only, PV-only, or no DER - and includes models for air-conditioning and eight grouped circuit-level loads. The simulator integrates National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) weather and Pecan Street load datasets, supports three default controllers (two for off-grid, and one for on-grid scenarios), and includes performance metrics and visualization tools. We demonstrate its flexibility through simulations on individual houses and a four-house community with heterogeneous DERs, benchmarking the controllers across built-in metrics and computation time. The results highlight the simulator's capability to systematically evaluate control policy performance under varying system configurations.</description>

      <title>Comparing Building Thermal Dynamics Models and Estimation Methods for Grid-Edge Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We need computationally efficient and accurate building thermal dynamics models for use in grid-edge applications. This work evaluates two grey-box approaches for modeling building thermal dynamics: RC-network models and structured regression models. For RC-network models, we compare parameter estimation methods including Nonlinear Least Squares, Batch Estimation, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We use the Almon Lag Structure with Linear Least Squares for estimating the structured regression models. The performance of these models and methods is evaluated on simulated house and commercial building data across three different simulation types.</description>

      <title>A Review On Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Lyapunov and Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be particularly effective in solving complex decision-making problems for a wide range of applications. From a control theory perspective, RL can be considered as an adaptive optimal control scheme. Lyapunov and barrier functions are the most commonly used certificates to guarantee system stability for a proposed/derived controller and constraint satisfaction guarantees, respectively, in control theoretic approaches. However, compared to theoretical guarantees available in control theoretic methods, RL lacks closed-loop stability of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction guarantees. Safe reinforcement learning refers to a class of constrained problems where the constraint violations lead to partial or complete system failure. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of safe RL techniques using Lyapunov and barrier functions to guarantee this notion of safety discussed (stability of the system in terms of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction during training and deployment). The different approaches employed are discussed in detail along with their shortcomings and benefits to provide critique and possible future research directions. Key motivation for this review is to discuss current theoretical approaches for safety and stability guarantees in RL similar to control theoretic approaches using Lyapunov and barrier functions. The review provides proven potential and promising scope of providing safety guarantees for complex dynamical systems with operational constraints using model-based and model-free RL.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Simulation and Data Management Tool for EnergyPlus Building Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new open-source, GUI-based application created using Plotly-Dash, along with an integrated PostgreSQL-based relational database, developed to streamline EnergyPlus building model simulation workflows. The application facilitates data generation, aggregation (across thermal zones), and visualization based on customizable user preferences, while the database efficiently stores and retrieves complex simulation data generated by EnergyPlus. We demonstrate the need for this application and database, emphasizing how existing approaches for generating, managing, and analyzing EnergyPlus simulation data can be cumbersome, particularly when handling a large number of building models with varying simulation setups. This integrated framework enables building energy engineers and researchers to simplify their EnergyPlus simulations, manage generated simulation data, perform data analyses, and support data-driven modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required to safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, stimulation is widely used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are conceptually meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspired Legal Tech Environmental Integration for Emergency Pharmaceutical Logistics with Entropy Modulated Collapse and Multilevel Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergency pharmaceutical logistics during rapid-onset disasters must balance timeliness, legal compliance, and environmental uncertainty. We present a hybrid framework that co-designs quantum-inspired decision dynamics, embedded legal constraints, and blockchain-verified environmental feedback. Candidate routes are modeled as a superposed state whose collapse is governed by entropy modulation-delaying commitment under ambiguity and accelerating resolution when coherent signals emerge. Legal statutes act as real-time projection operators shaping feasible choices, while environmental decoherence cues adjust confidence and path viability. The core engine is situated within a multilevel governance and mechanism design architecture, establishing clear roles, accountability channels, and audit trails. Large-scale simulations in wildfire scenarios demonstrate substantial gains over conventional baselines in latency, compliance, and robustness, while preserving interpretability and fairness adaptation. The resulting system offers a deployable, governance-aware infrastructure where law and physical risk jointly inform emergency routing decisions.</description>

      <title>On Irreversibility and Stochastic Systems: Part One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We attempt to characterize irreversibility of a dynamical system from the existence of different forward and backward mathematical representations depending on the direction of the time arrow. Such different representations have been studied intensively and are shown to exist for stochastic diffusion models. In this setting one has however to face the preliminary justification of stochastic description for physical systems which are described by classical mechanics as inherently deterministic and conservative.
  In part one of this paper we first address this modeling problem for linear systems in a deterministic context. We show that forward-backward representations can also describe conservative finite dimensional deterministic systems when they are coupled to an infinite-dimensional conservative heat bath. A novel key observation is that the heat bath acts on the finite-dimensional conservative system by {\em state-feedback} and can shift its eigenvalues to make the system dissipative but may also generate another totally unstable model which naturally evolves backward in time.
  In the second part, we address the stochastic description of these two representations. Under a natural family of invariant measures the heat bath can be shown to induce a white noise input acting on the system making it look like a true dissipative diffusion.</description>

      <title>Gradient- and Newton-Based Unit Vector Extremum Seeking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for achieving stable and efficient convergence in multivariable extremum seeking control (ESC) using sliding mode techniques. Drawing inspiration from both classical sliding mode control and more recent developments in finite-time and fixed-time control, we propose a new framework that integrates these concepts into Gradient- and Newton-based ESC schemes based on sinusoidal perturbation signals. The key innovation lies in the use of discontinuous "relay-type" control components, replacing traditional proportional feedback to estimate the gradient of unknown quadratic nonlinear performance maps with Unit Vector Control (UVC). This represents the first attempt to address real-time, model-free optimization using sliding modes within the classical extremum seeking paradigm. In the Gradient-based approach, the convergence rate is influenced by the unknown Hessian of the objective function. In contrast, the Newton-based method overcomes this limitation by employing a dynamic estimator for the inverse of the Hessian, implemented via a Riccati equation filter. We establish finite-time convergence of the closed-loop average system to the extremum point for both methods by leveraging Lyapunov-based analysis and averaging theory tailored to systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations validate the proposed method, illustrating significantly faster convergence and improved robustness compared to conventional ESC strategies, which typically guarantee only exponential stability. The results also demonstrate that the Gradient-based method exhibits slower convergence and higher transients since the gradient trajectory follows the curved and steepest-descent path, whereas the Newton-based method achieves faster convergence and improved overall performance going straightly to the extremum.</description>

      <title>An Analytical and Experimental Study of Distributed Uplink Beamforming in the Presence of Carrier Frequency Offsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing distributed multi-user beamforming (D-MUBF) in time division duplex (TDD)-based multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems faces significant challenges. One of the most fundamental challenges is achieving accurate over-the-air (OTA) timing and frequency synchronization among distributed access points (APs), particularly due to residual frequency offsets caused by local oscillator (LO) drifts. Despite decades of research on synchronization for MU-MIMO, there are only a few experimental studies that evaluate D-MUBF techniques under imperfect frequency synchronization among distributed antennas. This paper presents an analytical and experimental assessment of D-MUBF methods in the presence of frequency synchronization errors. We provide closed-form expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a function of channel characteristics and statistical properties of carrier frequency offset (CFO) among AP antennas. In addition, through experimental evaluations conducted with the RENEW massive MIMO testbed, we collected comprehensive datasets across various experimental scenarios. These datasets comprise uplink pilot samples for channel and CFO estimation, in addition to uplink multi-user data intended for analyzing D-MUBF techniques. By examining these datasets, we assess the performance of D-MUBF in the presence of CFO and compare the analytical predictions with empirical measurements. Furthermore, we make the datasets publicly available and provide insights on utilizing them for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Control-affine Schr\"odinger Bridge and Generalized Bohm Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering (transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the lens of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Machine Learning Models for Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08611v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a polarization-insensitive ultra-broadband terahertz metamaterial absorber based on vanadium dioxide (VO2) and evaluates machine learning methods for predicting its absorption performance. The structure consists of a VO2 metasurface, a MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. It achieves more than 90% absorption between 5.72 and 11.11 THz, covering a 5.38 THz bandwidth with an average absorptance of 98.15%. A dataset of 9,018 samples was generated from full-wave simulations by varying patch width, dielectric thickness, and frequency. Six regression models were trained: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Bagging. Performance was measured using adjusted R2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Ensemble models achieved the best results, with Bagging reaching an adjusted R2 of 0.9985 and RMSE of 0.0146. The workflow offers a faster alternative to exhaustive simulations and can be applied to other metamaterial designs, enabling efficient evaluation and optimization.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limitations of monotonic tracking systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the monotonic tracking control problem for continuous-time single-input single-output linear systems using output-feedback linear controllers in this paper. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem to be solvable and expose its fundamental limitations: the exact feasible locations of the plant zeros, the minimum controller order possible, and the maximum decay rate achievable for the closed-loop system. The relationship between these bounds is explained by a simple geometric shape for plants with a pair of complex-conjugate zeros.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Robotic Material Handling: Learning, Planning, and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive, labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world experiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck loading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the system's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of material handling tasks on a full scale.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Free Fast Optimal Control: Bang-Ride Property, Monotonicity, and Applications to Fast Battery Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-input fast optimal control problems, which aim to achieve the optimal objective as fast as possible, occur in various real-world applications. In the case of fast battery charging, the associated optimal control problem becomes computationally challenging when detailed battery models are used. A recent heuristic optimization-free algorithm can significantly reduce the computational cost and provide an approximate solution, consistent with many heuristic input profiles in practice. These heuristic solutions have several special properties: They follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a constraint and applies the maximum feasible input. This work investigates when the above properties arise in the optimal input, and ultimately, when the heuristic input profiles satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By exploiting Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), we show that the optimal control is bang-ride under regularity conditions on constraint switching and local controllability of the system. Moreover, the special type of bang-ride behavior, i.e., applying the maximum feasible input, arises under the monotonicity of the system, objective function, and restricted sensitivity of the constraints. These results provide a theoretical justification for a class of charging heuristics and the fast optimization-free algorithm.</description>

      <title>Learning Generative Models for Climbing Aircraft from Radar Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction (TP) for climbing aircraft is hampered by the presence of epistemic uncertainties concerning aircraft operation, which can lead to significant misspecification between predicted and observed trajectories. This paper proposes a generative model for climbing aircraft in which the standard Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model is enriched by a functional correction to the thrust that is learned from data. The method offers three features: predictions of the arrival time with 26.7% less error when compared to BADA; generated trajectories that are realistic when compared to test data; and a means of computing confidence bounds for minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Informed Deep Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to the net active and reactive power injections patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information through a novel hidden function. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability, but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Coupled Sensor Placement and Path-Planning in Unknown Time-Varying Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address path-planning for a mobile agent to navigate in an unknown environment with minimum exposure to a spatially and temporally varying threat field. The threat field is estimated using pointwise noisy measurements from a mobile sensor network. For this problem, we present a new information gain measure for optimal sensor placement that quantifies reduction in uncertainty in the path cost rather than the environment state. This measure, which we call the context-relevant mutual information (CRMI), couples the sensor placement and path-planning problem. We propose an iterative coupled sensor configuration and path-planning (CSCP) algorithm. At each iteration, this algorithm places sensors to maximize CRMI, updates the threat estimate using new measurements, and recalculates the path with minimum expected exposure to the threat. The iterations converge when the path cost variance, which is an indicator of risk, reduces below a desired threshold. We show that CRMI is submodular, and therefore, greedy optimization provides near-optimal sensor placements while maintaining computational efficiency of the CSCP algorithm. Distance-based sensor reconfiguration costs are introduced in a modified CRMI measure, which we also show to be submodular. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the principal advantage of this algorithm is that near-optimal low-variance paths are achieved using far fewer sensor measurements as compared to a standard sensor placement method.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Certificate Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of verifying different properties of discrete time dynamical systems, namely, reachability, safety and reach-while-avoid. To achieve this, we adopt a data driven perspective and, using past system trajectories as data, we aim at learning a specific function termed certificate for each property we wish to verify. We seek to minimize a loss function, designed to encompass conditions on the certificate to be learned that encode the satisfaction of the associated property. Besides learning a certificate, we quantify probabilistically its generalization properties, namely, how likely it is for a certificate to be valid (and hence for the associated property to be satisfied) when it comes to a new system trajectory not included in the training data set. We view this problem under the realm of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning under the notion of compression, and use recent advancements of the so-called scenario approach to obtain scalable generalization bounds on the learned certificates. To achieve this, we design a novel algorithm that minimizes the loss function and hence constructs a certificate, and at the same time determines a quantity termed compression, which is instrumental in obtaining meaningful probabilistic guarantees. This process is novel per se and provides a constructive mechanism for compression set calculation, thus opening the road for its use to more general non-convex optimization problems. We verify the efficacy of our methodology on several numerical case studies, and compare it (both theoretically and numerically) with closely related results on data-driven property verification.</description>

      <title>Impedance Space Method: Time-Independent Parametric Ellipses for Robot Compliant Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel 3D graphical representation for impedance control, called the impedance space, to foster the analysis of the dynamic behavior of robotic compliant controllers. The method overcomes limitations of existing 2D graphical approaches by incorporating mass, stiffness, and damping dynamics, and associates the impedance control parameters with linear transformations to plot a parametric 3D ellipse and its projections in 2D for a mass-spring-damper impedance under sinusoidal reference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed representation for analysis of impedance control. The method applies to various compliant control topologies and can be extended to other model-based control approaches.</description>

      <title>On Composable and Parametric Uncertainty in Systems Co-Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the design of complex systems requires navigating interdependent decisions, heterogeneous components, and multiple objectives. Our monotone theory of co-design offers a compositional framework for addressing this challenge, modeling systems as Design Problems (DPs), representing trade-offs between functionalities and resources within partially ordered sets. While current approaches model uncertainty using intervals, capturing worst- and best-case bounds, they fail to express probabilistic notions such as risk and confidence. These limitations hinder the applicability of co-design in domains where uncertainty plays a critical role. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for composable uncertainty in co-design, capturing intervals, distributions, and parametrized models. This extension enables reasoning about risk-performance trade-offs and supports advanced queries such as experiment design, learning, and multi-stage decision making. We demonstrate the expressiveness and utility of the framework via a numerical case study on the uncertainty-aware co-design of task-driven Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).</description>

      <title>SIL Allocation for Mitigation Safety Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SIL (Safety Integrity Level) allocation plays a pivotal role in evaluating the significance of Safety Functions (SFs) within high-risk industries. The outcomes of a SIL allocation study determine the design specifications necessary to uphold the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) below permissible limits, thus managing risk effectively. While extensive research has focused on SIL allocation for preventive SFs, there is a noticeable gap in attention towards mitigation SFs. To address this gap, this paper discusses the shortcomings of current methods and proposes a new approach to overcome them. The principles of the proposed method are substantiated by detailed mathematical formulation and the practical application of the method is demonstrated through a case study in a road tunnel project.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Transfer Policies for Parallel Queues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of load balancing in parallel queues by transferring customers between them at discrete points in time. Holding costs accrue as customers wait in the queue, while transfer decisions incur both fixed (setup) costs and variable costs that increase with the number of transfers and travel distance, and vary by transfer direction. Our work is primarily motivated by inter-facility patient transfers to address imbalanced congestion and inequity in access to care during surges in hospital demand. Analyzing an associated fluid control problem, we show that under general assumptions, including time-varying arrivals and convex holding costs, the optimal policy partitions the state-space into a well-defined $\textit{no-transfer region}$ and its complement, implying that transferring is optimal if and only if the system is sufficiently imbalanced. In the absence of fixed transfer costs, an optimal policy moves the state to the no-transfer region's boundary; in contrast, with fixed costs, the state is moved to its relative interior. Leveraging our structural results, we propose a simulation-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to find effective transfer policies for the stochastic system. We investigate the performance and robustness of the fluid and ADP policies in a case study calibrated using data during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Greater Toronto Area, which demonstrates that transferring patients between hospitals could result in up to 27.7% reduction in total cost with relatively few transfers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface cracks in infrastructure can lead to severe deterioration and expensive maintenance if not efficiently repaired. Manual repair methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and imprecise. While advancements in robotic perception and manipulation have progressed autonomous crack repair, three key challenges remain: accurate localization in the robot's coordinate frame, adaptability to varying crack sizes, and realistic validation of repairs. We present an adaptive, autonomous robotic system for surface crack detection and repair using advanced sensing technologies to enhance precision and safety for humans. A laser scanner is used to refine crack coordinates for accurate localization. Furthermore, our adaptive crack filling approach outperforms fixed speed techniques in efficiency and consistency. We validate our method using 3D printed cracks under realistic conditions, demonstrating repeatable testing. This research contributes to the field of human-robot interaction by reducing manual labor, improving safety, and streamlining maintenance operations, ultimately paving the way for more sophisticated and integrated construction robotics.</description>

      <title>The Social Life of Industrial Arms: How Arousal and Attention Shape Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores how human perceptions of a non-anthropomorphic robotic manipulator are shaped by two key dimensions of behaviour: arousal, defined as the robot's movement energy and expressiveness, and attention, defined as the robot's capacity to selectively orient toward and engage with a user. We introduce a novel control architecture that integrates a gaze-like attention engine with an arousal-modulated motion system to generate socially meaningful behaviours. In a user study, we find that robots exhibiting high attention -- actively directing their focus toward users -- are perceived as warmer and more competent, intentional, and lifelike. In contrast, high arousal -- characterized by fast, expansive, and energetic motions -- increases perceptions of discomfort and disturbance. Importantly, a combination of focused attention and moderate arousal yields the highest ratings of trust and sociability, while excessive arousal diminishes social engagement. These findings offer design insights for endowing non-humanoid robots with expressive, intuitive behaviours that support more natural human-robot interaction.</description>
