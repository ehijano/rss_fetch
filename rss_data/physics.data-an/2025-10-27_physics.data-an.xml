      <title>Pty-Chi: A PyTorch-based modern ptychographic data analysis package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography has become an indispensable tool for high-resolution, non-destructive imaging using coherent light sources. The processing of ptychographic data critically depends on robust, efficient, and flexible computational reconstruction software. We introduce Pty-Chi, an open-source ptychographic reconstruction package built on PyTorch that unifies state-of-the-art analytical algorithms with automatic differentiation methods. Pty-Chi provides a comprehensive suite of reconstruction algorithms while supporting advanced experimental parameter corrections such as orthogonal probe relaxation and multislice modeling. Leveraging PyTorch as the computational backend ensures vendor-agnostic GPU acceleration, multi-device parallelization, and seamless access to modern optimizers. An object-oriented, modular design makes Pty-Chi highly extendable, enabling researchers to prototype new imaging models, integrate machine learning approaches, or build entirely new workflows on top of its core components. We demonstrate Pty-Chi's capabilities through challenging case studies that involve limited coherence, low overlap, and unstable illumination during scanning, which highlight its accuracy, versatility, and extensibility. With community-driven development and open contribution, Pty-Chi offers a modern, maintainable platform for advancing computational ptychography and for enabling innovative imaging algorithms at synchrotron facilities and beyond.</description>

      <title>The local Gaussian correlation networks among return tails in the Chinese stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial networks based on Pearson correlations have been intensively studied. However, previous studies may have led to misleading and catastrophic results because of several critical shortcomings of the Pearson correlation. The local Gaussian correlation coefficient, a new measurement of statistical dependence between variables, has unique advantages including capturing local nonlinear dependence and handling heavy-tailed distributions. This study constructs financial networks using the local Gaussian correlation coefficients between tail regions of stock returns in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The work systematically analyzes fundamental network metrics including node centrality, average shortest path length, and entropy. Compared with the local Gaussian correlation network among positive tails and the conventional Pearson correlation network, the properties of the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails are more sensitive to the stock market risks. This finding suggests researchers should prioritize the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails. Future work should reevaluate existing findings using the local Gaussian correlation method.</description>

      <title>Efficient Exploration of Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</description>

      <title>Optimizing searches for gravitational wave bursts 2 using coherent WaveBurst 2G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most general searches for gravitational wave transients (GWTs) rely on data analysis methods that do not assume prior knowledge of the signal waveform, direction, or arrival time on Earth. These searches provide data-driven signal reconstructions that are crucial both for testing available emission models and for discovering yet-to-be-uncovered sources. Here, we discuss progress in the detection performance of the coherent WaveBurst second-generation pipeline (cWB-2G), which is highly adaptable to both minimally modeled and model-informed searches for GWTs. Several search configurations for GWTs are examined using approximately 14.8 days of observation time from the third observing run by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). Recent enhancements include a ranking statistic fully based on multivariate classification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting, a thorough validation of the statistical significance accuracy of GWT candidates, and a measurement of the correlations of false alarms and simulated detections between different concurrent searches. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive comparison of cWB-2G performance on data from networks made of two and three detectors, and we demonstrate the advantage of combining concurrent searches for GWTs of generic morphology in a global observatory. This work offers essential insights for assessing our data analysis strategies in ongoing and future LVK searches for generic GWTs.</description>

      <title>L$^2$M: Mutual Information Scaling Law for Long-Context Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a universal theoretical framework for understanding long-context language modeling based on a bipartite mutual information scaling law that we rigorously verify in natural language. We demonstrate that bipartite mutual information captures multi-token interactions distinct from and scaling independently of conventional two-point mutual information, and show that this provides a more complete characterization of the dependencies needed for accurately modeling long sequences. Leveraging this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L$^2$M) condition, which lower bounds the necessary scaling of a model's history state -- the latent variables responsible for storing past information -- for effective long-context modeling. We validate the framework and its predictions on transformer and state-space models. Our work provides a principled foundation to understand long-context modeling and to design more efficient architectures with stronger long-context capabilities, with potential applications beyond natural language.</description>

      <title>Bayesian model-data comparison incorporating theoretical uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate comparisons between theoretical models and experimental data are critical for scientific progress. However, inferred physical model parameters can vary significantly with the chosen physics model, highlighting the importance of properly accounting for theoretical uncertainties. In this Letter, we present a Bayesian framework that explicitly quantifies these uncertainties by statistically modeling theory errors, guided by qualitative knowledge of a theory's varying reliability across the input domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using two systems: a simple ball drop experiment and multi-stage heavy-ion simulations. In both cases incorporating model discrepancy leads to improved parameter estimates, with systematic improvements observed as additional experimental observables are integrated.</description>
