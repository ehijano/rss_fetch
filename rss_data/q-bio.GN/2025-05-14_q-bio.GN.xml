      <title>Bridging Large Language Models and Single-Cell Transcriptomics in Dissecting Selective Motor Neuron Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding cell identity and function through single-cell level sequencing data remains a key challenge in computational biology. We present a novel framework that leverages gene-specific textual annotations from the NCBI Gene database to generate biologically contextualized cell embeddings. For each cell in a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, we rank genes by expression level, retrieve their NCBI Gene descriptions, and transform these descriptions into vector embedding representations using large language models (LLMs). The models used include OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, and text-embedding-3-large (Jan 2024), as well as domain-specific models BioBERT and SciBERT. Embeddings are computed via an expression-weighted average across the top N most highly expressed genes in each cell, providing a compact, semantically rich representation. This multimodal strategy bridges structured biological data with state-of-the-art language modeling, enabling more interpretable downstream applications such as cell-type clustering, cell vulnerability dissection, and trajectory inference.</description>

      <title>Revolutionising Bacterial Genomics: Graph-Based Strategies for Improved Variant Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant advancement in bioinformatics is using genome graph techniques to improve variation discovery across organisms. Traditional approaches, such as bwa mem, rely on linear reference genomes for genomic analyses but may introduce biases when applied to highly diverse bacterial genomes of the same species. Pangenome graphs provide an alternative paradigm for evaluating structural and minor variations within a graphical framework, including insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Pangenome graphs enhance the detection and interpretation of complex genetic variants by representing the full genetic diversity of a species. In this study, we present a robust and reliable bioinformatics pipeline utilising the PanGenome Graph Builder (PGGB) and the Variation Graph toolbox (vg giraffe) to align whole-genome sequencing data, call variants against a graph reference, and construct pangenomes from assembled genomes. Our results demonstrate that leveraging pangenome graphs over a single linear reference genome significantly improves mapping rates and variant calling accuracy for simulated and actual bacterial pathogens datasets.</description>

      <title>The Environment-Dependent Regulatory Landscape of the E. coli Genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All cells respond to changes in both their internal milieu and the environment around them through the regulation of their genes. Despite decades of effort, there remain huge gaps in our knowledge of both the function of many genes (the so-called y-ome) and how they adapt to changing environments via regulation. Here we describe a joint experimental and theoretical dissection of the regulation of a broad array of over 100 biologically interesting genes in E. coli across 39 diverse environments, permitting us to discover the binding sites and transcription factors that mediate regulatory control. Using a combination of mutagenesis, massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry and tools from information theory and statistical physics, we go from complete ignorance of a promoter's environment-dependent regulatory architecture to predictive models of its behavior. As a proof of principle of the biological insights to be gained from such a study, we chose a combination of genes from the y-ome, toxin-antitoxin pairs, and genes hypothesized to be part of regulatory modules; in all cases, we discovered a host of new insights into their underlying regulatory landscape and resulting biological function.</description>

      <title>NMP-PaK: Near-Memory Processing Acceleration of Scalable De Novo Genome Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: De novo assembly enables investigations of unknown genomes, paving the way for personalized medicine and disease management. However, it faces immense computational challenges arising from the excessive data volumes and algorithmic complexity.
  While state-of-the-art de novo assemblers utilize distributed systems for extreme-scale genome assembly, they demand substantial computational and memory resources. They also fail to address the inherent challenges of de novo assembly, including a large memory footprint, memory-bound behavior, and irregular data patterns stemming from complex, interdependent data structures. Given these challenges, de novo assembly merits a custom hardware solution, though existing approaches have not fully addressed the limitations.
  We propose NMP-PaK, a hardware-software co-design that accelerates scalable de novo genome assembly through near-memory processing (NMP). Our channel-level NMP architecture addresses memory bottlenecks while providing sufficient scratchpad space for processing elements. Customized processing elements maximize parallelism while efficiently handling large data structures that are both dynamic and interdependent. Software optimizations include customized batch processing to reduce the memory footprint and hybrid CPU-NMP processing to address hardware underutilization caused by irregular data patterns.
  NMP-PaK conducts the same genome assembly while incurring a 14X smaller memory footprint compared to the state-of-the-art de novo assembly. Moreover, NMP-PaK delivers a 16X performance improvement over the CPU baseline, with a 2.4X reduction in memory operations. Consequently, NMP-PaK achieves 8.3X greater throughput than state-of-the-art de novo assembly under the same resource constraints, showcasing its superior computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking AI scientists in omics data-driven biological research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large language models and multi-agent systems has sparked growing interest in AI scientists capable of autonomous biological research. However, existing benchmarks either focus on reasoning without data or on data analysis with predefined statistical answers, lacking realistic, data-driven evaluation settings. Here, we introduce the Biological AI Scientist Benchmark (BaisBench), a benchmark designed to assess AI scientists' ability to generate biological discoveries through data analysis and reasoning with external knowledge. BaisBench comprises two tasks: cell type annotation on 31 expert-labeled single-cell datasets, and scientific discovery through answering 198 multiple-choice questions derived from the biological insights of 41 recent single-cell studies. Systematic experiments on state-of-the-art AI scientists and LLM agents showed that while promising, current models still substantially underperform human experts on both tasks. We hope BaisBench will fill this gap and serve as a foundation for advancing and evaluating AI models for scientific discovery. The benchmark can be found at: https://github.com/EperLuo/BaisBench.</description>
