      <title>An Analysis of the Mapping Approach to Surface Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) was proposed as a method to simulate the non-adiabatic dynamics of two-level systems. It was shown that the method possesses many desirable qualities, both theoretically and through numerical simulations. We explain this success by proving that, out of similar mapping methods, MASH dynamics is unique in guaranteeing correct thermalisation, but that many different "estimators" can be used on top of it. We also show that MASH can successfully calculate multi-time correlation functions, which can be used for the simulation of 2D spectra. We also generalise an, in principle more accurate, technique known as the quantum jump procedure to these calculations and show that, contrary to expectations, it does not improve the results.</description>

      <title>On the Underlying Mechanism of Light-Induced Patterning of N719-Stained Photoanodes for "Photovoltaic Photographs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, "photovoltaic photographs" were proposed as a creative application of photovoltaic technologies, relevant in fields such as architecture or the automotive industry. In this application an image is created by light-induced patterning of the photoactive layer, causing a local change in the appearance of the solar cell. In order to further develop this concept, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanism underlying these local changes. Here, UV-VIS and infrared spectroscopic techniques, as well as Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, have been used to investigate the physico-chemical changes induced by this process in the photoactive layer of proof-of-concept photo-patterned dye-sensitized solar cells. We show that, for N719 photovoltaic photographs, TiO2 plays a crucial role and that the dye undergoes a multi-step chemical degradation, related to its isothiocyanate ligand. These insights are of importance for a better understanding of the photo-induced degradation of N719, a more substantiated control of the light-induced patterning process, and to design appropriate light-induced patterning techniques for other classes of solar cells.</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer Through Vapor-Liquid Interfaces From Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the capabilities of hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) to predict mass transfer across vapor-liquid interfaces by studying the response of an initially equilibrated pure component vapor-liquid system to the localized insertion of a second component. Hydrodynamic DFT captures the effect of interfaces on the dynamics by modeling the chemical potential gradients of an inhomogeneous system based on classical DFT. Hydrodynamic DFT effectively connects molecular models with continuum fluid dynamics. Away from interfaces the framework simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations. We employ Maxwell-Stefan diffusion with a generalized driving force to model diffusive molecular transport in inhomogeneous systems. For the considered Lennard--Jones truncated and shifted (LJTS) fluid, we utilize a non-local Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed truncated and shifted (PeTS) equation of state. The model provides noise-free partial densities and fluxes for the mass transfer near the interface, as well as profiles of these quantities across the interface. A comparison with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations shows that hydrodynamic DFT accurately predicts mass transfer across the interface, including microscopic phenomena such as the temporary enrichment and repulsion of the light boiling component at the interface. Combining generalized entropy scaling with generalized Maxwell-Stefan diffusion allows for an accurate description of diffusive molecular transport in the system. This approach can accurately predict phase behavior, equilibrium interfaces, and mass transfer across interfaces based on molecular interactions for mixtures of strongly dissimilar components. Our results suggest that hydrodynamic DFT can accurately predict the dynamics of mixtures at vapor-liquid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Probing interfacial water via color-center-enabled spin magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of confined water at liquid-solid interfaces is central to numerous physical, chemical, and biological processes, yet remains experimentally challenging. Here, we utilize shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to investigate the nanoscale dynamics of interfacial water confined between the diamond surface and an overlying fluorinated oil droplet. Using NV-based nuclear magnetic resonance protocols selectively sensitive to 1H and 19F, we independently track water and oil near the interface under ambient conditions. Comparing opposite sides of a doubly-implanted diamond membrane - one exposed to oil, the other not - we uncover a slow, multi-day process in which the interfacial water layer is gradually depleted. This desorption appears to be driven by sustained interactions with the fluorinated oil and is supported by molecular dynamics simulations and surface-sensitive X-ray spectroscopies. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into long-timescale hydration dynamics and underscore the power of NV-NMR for probing liquid-solid heterointerfaces with chemical specificity.</description>

      <title>Complex Absorbing Potential Green's Function Methods for Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex absorbing potential (CAP) formalism has been successfully employed in various wavefunction-based methods to study electronic resonance states. In contrast, Green's function-based methods are widely used to compute ionization potentials and electron affinities but have seen limited application to resonances. We integrate the CAP formalism within the $GW$ approximation, enabling the description of electronic resonances in a Green's function framework. This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \ce{N2^-}, \ce{CO^-}, \ce{CO_2^-}, \ce{C2H2-}, \ce{C2H4-}, and \ce{CH2O-}. It offers a fast and practical route to approximate both the lifetimes and positions of resonance states, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art wavefunction-based methods.</description>

      <title>Invariance of quantum scattering rate coefficients to anisotropy of atom-molecule interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Understanding Reaction Mechanisms from Start to Finish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of rare but important events in complex molecular systems, such as protein folding or ligand (un)binding, requires accurately mapping transition paths from an initial to a final state. The committor is the ideal reaction coordinate for this purpose, but calculating it for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems has long been considered intractable. Here, we introduce an iterative path sampling strategy for computing the committor function for systems with high free energy barriers. We start with an initial guess to define isocommittor interfaces for transition interface sampling. The resulting path ensemble is then reweighted and used to train a neural network, yielding a more accurate committor model. This process is repeated until convergence, effectively solving the long-standing circular problem in enhanced sampling where a good reaction coordinate is needed to generate efficient sampling, and vice-versa. The final, converged committor model can be interrogated to extract mechanistic insights. We demonstrate the power of our method on a benchmark 2D potential and a more complex host-guest (un)binding process in explicit solvent.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy of a Photosynthetic Reaction Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and F\"orster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Covalently Integrated CNT@rGO for Superior Conductivity and Cycling Stability in Lithium-Ion Batterie</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limitations of conventional conductive agents in lithium-ion batteries, such as carbon black and graphite flakes, have driven the search for high-performance alternatives. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene offer exceptional conductivity and lower dosage requirements, but face challenges related to high costs and complex fabrication processes. Here, we report a simple and cost-effective one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for the ultra-high yield growth (7692.31%) of CNTs on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) substrate, forming a three-dimensional CNT@rGO composite with covalent integration. When employed as a conductive agent for lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cathodes, the CNT@rGO composites significantly enhance rate performance across 1-6C rates, and demonstrate exceptional cycling stability, achieving 96.32% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1C. The synergistic structure facilitates multiple conductive pathways, minimizes catalyst residue (0.52%), and ensures uniform dispersion, providing an effective and cost-efficient solution for next-generation battery technology. This study lays the foundation for the large-scale application of high-performance carbon conductive agents in battery technology.</description>

      <title>Natural orbitals and sparsity of quantum mutual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural orbitals, defined in electronic structure and quantum chemistry as the (molecular) orbitals diagonalizing the one-particle reduced density matrix of the ground state, have been conjectured for decades to be the perfect reference orbitals to describe electron correlation. In the present work we applied the Wavefunction-Adapted Hamiltonian Through Orbital Rotation (WAHTOR) method to study correlated empirical ans\"atze for quantum computing. In all representative molecules considered, we show that the converged orbitals are coinciding with natural orbitals. Interestingly, the resulting quantum mutual information matrix built on such orbitals is also maximally sparse, providing a clear picture that such orbital choice is indeed able to provide the optimal basis to describe electron correlation. The correlation is therefore encoded in a smaller number of qubit pairs contributing to the quantum mutual information matrix.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of barium titanate nanocrystals determined via a polymer nanocomposite approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for high energy storage materials has garnered substantial attention towards lead-free ferroelectric nanocrystals (NCs), such as BaTiO3 (BTO), for next-generation multilayer ceramic capacitors. Notably, it remains challenging to accurately measure the dielectric constant and polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop for BTO NCs. Herein, we report on nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of BTO NCs via a polymer nanocomposite approach. Specifically, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)(PVP)/BTO nanocomposite films of 3-10 {\mu}m thickness, containing 380 nm tetragonal-phased and 60 nm cubic-phased BTO NCs with uniform particle dispersion, were prepared. Theoretical deconvolution of the broad experimental P-E loops of the PVP/BTO NC composite films revealed three contributions, that is, the linear deformational polarization of the nanocomposites, the polarization of BTO NCs (Pp ), and the polarization from strong particle-particle interactions. Using different mixing rules and nonlinear dielectric analysis, the overall dielectric constants of BTO NCs were obtained, from which the internal field in the BTO NCs (Ep ) was estimated. Consequently, the Pp-Ep hysteresis loops were obtained for the BTO380 and BTO60 NCs. Interestingly, BTO380 exhibited square-shaped ferroelectric loops, whereas BTO60 displayed slim paraelectric loops. This work presents a robust and versatile route to extract the Pp-Ep loops of ferroelectric NCs from polymer/ceramic nanocomposites.</description>

      <title>Latent Thermodynamic Flows: Unified Representation Learning and Generative Modeling of Temperature-Dependent Behaviors from Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work, we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow, important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive computational results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C13Cl2 exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation. We resolved chiral geometries of the closed-shell singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. The {\pi}-orbital basis of the singlets twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation, which is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the {\pi}-orbital basis is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations, corresponding to a quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition, implying a Berry phase of {\pi}/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet isomer.</description>

      <title>Upscaling the hyperpolarization sample volume of an automat-ed hydrogenative parahydrogen-induced polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suffer from inherently low sensitivity due to the weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins. Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) offers a powerful route to enhance NMR signals by several orders of magnitude, enabling real-time metabolic imaging. However, PHIP implementations are often constrained by small sample volumes, limited automation, and complex high-pressure requirements. In this work, we present an upgraded, automated PHIP system capable of hyperpolarizing sample volumes of up to 2.2 mL, making it suitable for preclinical MRI applications. We developed several high-pressure reactors and multi-port NMR tube caps compatible with standard commercial 5, 10, and 16 mm glass tubes. Reactor designs were simulated and fabricated from chemically resistant polymers, ensuring mechanical safety at more than 30 bar. Using FLASH MRI, nutation, and CPMG sequences, we characterized magnetic field homogeneity and stability, establishing optimal sample dimensions (12.5/16 mm ID/OD glass tube, 20 mm height) with B0 inhomogeneity below 2.5 ppm and B1 inhomogeneity around 1%. A high level of injection reproducibility was confirmed (volume precision ~0.6%). Optimization of experimental parameters, including hydrogenation pressure, pH2 flow rate, and sample temperature, enabled rapid and efficient polarization transfer. At optimized conditions (20 bar pH2, 2 L/min flow, 55{\deg}C, 4 s bubbling time), up to 31.3% 1H polarization of two protons was achieved for deuterated ethyl acetate in acetone with the theoretical maximum of 50%. This level of polarization was achieved with a duty cycle of 80 s, and the standard deviation of the mean was below 6.8%.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Ordering and Lattice Distortions in Entropy-Stabilized Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy-stabilized oxides (ESOs), driven by high configurational entropy, have gained phenomenological research interest due to their potential for tailoring structure property relationships. However, the chemical short range ordering (SRO) and its interplay with local lattice distortion (LD) remain to be explored, although they could diminish the configurational entropy and potentially impact structure property relationships. A combination of experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to investigate the SRO and LD in the prototype ESO, Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O, generally referred to as J14. We demonstrate that the efficiency and accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) relaxed special quasirandom structures (SQS) enhances the analysis of the local structure of J14, unveiling the unique local cationic environments. Importantly, this joint experimental and computational approach sheds light on the understanding of local structure and structure property relationships in J14, demonstrating the necessity for further research into other high entropy and compositionally complex materials.</description>

      <title>OrbitAll: A Unified Quantum Mechanical Representation Deep Learning Framework for All Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information. OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects. OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10 times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Combining Graph Neural Networks and Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Molecular Inference under the Two-Layered Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation, the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input, and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within reasonable computational time.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Oxidative Degradation of WSe2 Nanosheets and Its Influence on HER Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selection of an appropriate solvent has long been a critical factor in the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) nanosheets. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) remains one of the most commonly used solvents due to its favourable surface tension compatibility, particularly with tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which facilitates a relatively high yield of exfoliated nanosheets. However, prolonged exposure of the nanosheets to NMP promotes oxidation, consequently diminishing their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, a more environmentally friendly solvent system, consisting of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionised water (DI), induces significantly less oxidation and results in enhanced HER performance. Notably, this green solvent system achieves the lowest overpotential of 0.209 V vs RHE after 24 hours of chronoamperometry.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a compact analytical approximation for the quantum partition function of systems composed of quantum oscillators. The proposed formula is general and applicable to an arbitrary number of oscillators described by a rather general class of potential energy functions (not necessarily polynomials). Starting from the exact path integral expression of the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy, and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators. These results are compared to "exact" numerical results obtained via Hamiltonian diagonalization for small systems and Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for larger ones.</description>

      <title>CEMP: a platform unifying high-throughput online calculation, databases and predictive models for clean energy materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of materials science is undergoing a shift from empirical approaches to data-driven and algorithm-oriented research paradigm. The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots as Emerging Optical Sensing Platforms for $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ Detection: Recent Approaches and Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the preceding years, nickel (Ni) and its compounds have been increasingly employed in various aspects of human social life, metallurgical/industrial manufactures, healthcare, and chemical processes. Although Ni is considered an essential trace element in biological systems, excessive intake or metabolic deficiency of \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) ions may cause detrimental health effects to living organisms. Therefore, a facile and accurate detection of \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\), especially in environmental and biological settings, is of huge significance. As an efficient detection method, assaying \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) using optical (colorimetric and/or fluorogenic) sensors has experienced quite a vigorous growth period, with a large number of excellent research contributions. Nanomaterial-based optical sensors, including metal nanoparticles (MNPs), quantum dots (QDs), and carbon dots (CDs), offer distinct advantages over conventional small-molecule organic and inorganic sensors. This study mainly provides an overview of the recent advancements and challenges related to the design strategies of various optical nanosensors to selectively detect the \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) ion. Emphasis has also been placed on comparing the sensing performance of various nanosensors, along with exploring future perspectives.</description>

Abstract: The extreme toxicity of cyanide (\ce{CN^-}) ions in diverse environmental media has garnered significant attention toward the design of well-organized molecular probes for their selective and sensitive detection. In this context, we present a monometallic Ru(II) complex (Ru-1), based on the 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole moiety, acting as a highly selective luminescent probe for \ce{CN^-} recognition in pure water. Additionally, Ru-1 also functions as an efficient sensor for \ce{F^-}, \ce{AcO^-}, and \ce{H2PO4^-} ions, along with \ce{CN^-}, when acetonitrile is used as the solvent system. The binding constant ($K_b$) and detection limit (LoD) for \ce{CN^-} were determined to be $3.05 \times 10^6$~M$^{-1}$ and 12.8~nM, respectively, in water. The close proximity of the N--H site to the Ru(II) center, along with its notable acidity, were identified as the primary factors responsible for the high selectivity of Ru-1 toward \ce{CN^-} in aqueous media. Job's plots and density functional theory (DFT) analyses were conducted to support the anion binding mechanism. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the \ce{CN^-}-induced emission lifetime change of Ru-1 in water. To explore practical applicability, the Ru-1 probe was developed into paper-based strips capable of detecting \ce{CN^-} ions in the millimolar range via the naked eye under 365~nm UV illumination. It was also effectively applied for the detection of \ce{CN^-} in human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines and natural food sources, such as apple seeds and sprouting potatoes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>CO2 Hydration at the Air-Water Interface: A Surface-Mediated 'In and Out' Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An understanding of the CO$_2$ + H$_2$O hydration reaction is crucial for modeling the effects of ocean acidification, for enabling novel carbon storage solutions, and as a model process in the geosciences. While the mechanism of this reaction has been investigated extensively in the condensed phase, its mechanism at the air-water interface remains elusive, leaving uncertain the contribution that surface-adsorbed CO$_2$ makes to the overall acidification reaction. In this study, we employ machine-learned potentials trained to various levels of theory to provide a molecular-level understanding of CO$_2$ hydration at the air-water interface. We show that reaction at the interface follows a surface-mediated `In and Out' mechanism: CO$_2$ diffuses into the aqueous surface layer, reacts to form carbonic acid, and is subsequently expelled from solution. We show that this surface layer provides a bulk-like solvation environment, engendering similar modes of reactivity and near-identical free energy profiles for the bulk and interfacial processes. Our study unveils a new, unconventional reaction mechanism that underscores the dynamic nature of the molecular reaction site at the air-water interface. The similarity between bulk and interfacial profiles shows that CO$_2$ hydration is equally as feasible under these two solvation environments and that acidification rates are likely enhanced by this additional surface contribution.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Molecular Benchmarks in Nonadiabatic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the coupled electronic and nuclear response of a molecule to light excitation requires the application of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. However, when faced with a specific photophysical or photochemical problem, selecting the most suitable theoretical approach from the wide array of available techniques is not a trivial task. The challenge is further complicated by the lack of systematic method comparisons and rigorous testing on realistic molecular systems. This absence of comprehensive molecular benchmarks remains a major obstacle to advances within the field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. A CECAM workshop, Standardizing Nonadiabatic Dynamics: Towards Common Benchmarks, was held in May 2024 to address this issue. This Perspective highlights the key challenges identified during the workshop in defining molecular benchmarks for nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, this work outlines some preliminary observations on essential components needed for simulations and proposes a roadmap aiming to establish, as an ultimate goal, a community-driven, standardized molecular benchmark set.</description>

      <title>Reduced-cost Relativistic Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster Method based on Frozen Natural Spinors: A State-Specific Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the theoretical framework, implementation, and benchmark results for a reduced-cost relativistic equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) method based on state-specific frozen natural spinors (SS-FNS). In this approach, the state-specific frozen natural spinors are derived from the second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) method, providing a compact virtual space for excited-state calculations. The excitation energies computed with the SS-FNS-EE-EOM-CCSD method exhibit smooth convergence with respect to the truncation threshold and demonstrate significant improvements over those obtained using the conventional MP2-based FNS approach. We have implemented the relativistic SS-FNS-EE-EOM-CCSD method using both the four-component Dirac-Coulomb and the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonians to compute excitation energies and transition properties. The X2CAMF-based relativistic EOM-CCSD method emerges as a promising approach for large-scale excited-state calculations, achieving excellent agreement with the standard relativistic EOM-CCSD method based on the untruncated canonical spinor basis, but at a significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>PropMolFlow: Property-guided Molecule Generation with Geometry-Complete Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Molecule generation is advancing rapidly in chemical discovery and drug design. Flow matching methods have recently set the state of the art (SOTA) in unconditional molecule generation, surpassing score-based diffusion models. However, diffusion models still lead in property-guided generation. In this work, we introduce PropMolFlow, a novel approach for property-guided molecule generation based on geometry-complete SE(3)-equivariant flow matching. Integrating five different property embedding methods with a Gaussian expansion of scalar properties, PropMolFlow achieves competitive performance against previous SOTA diffusion models in conditional molecule generation across various properties while preserving the stability and validity of the generated molecules, consistent with its unconditional counterpart. Additionally, it enables faster inference with significantly fewer time steps compared to baseline models. We highlight the importance of validating the properties of generated molecules through DFT calculations performed at the same level of theory as the training data. Specifically, our analysis identifies properties that require DFT validation and others where a pretrained SE(3) geometric vector perceptron regressors provide sufficiently accurate predictions on generated molecules. Furthermore, we introduce a new property metric to assess the model's ability to propose molecules with underrepresented property values, assessing its capacity for out-of-distribution generalization. Our findings reveal shortcomings in existing structural metrics, which mistakenly validate open-shell molecules or molecules with invalid valence-charge configurations, underscoring the need for improved evaluation frameworks. Overall, this work paves the way for developing targeted property-guided generation methods, enhancing the design of molecular generative models for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Quantitative agreement between experiment and theory for Vibrational Circular Dichroism enhanced by electronically excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity enhancement in vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) arises in open-shell transition metal complexes from coupling between ground-state vibrational transitions and magnetic dipole-allowed transitions to low-lying excited states (LLESs). In this work we apply Nafie's vibronic coupling theory to M(II)-(-)-sparteine-Cl$_2$ (M=Zn, Co, Ni) complexes to investigate these enhancement effects. We show that the VCD intensity is extremely sensitive to the excitation energies that neither time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) nor state-averaged complete active space self consistent field (SA-CASSCF) calculations can predict with sufficient accuracy. We argue that instead of using more accurate quantum chemistry methods these excitation energies can be treated as parameters and optimized against experimental spectra. With this approach we obtain simulated VCD similarity scores above 0.4, a threshold considered reliable for absolute configuration assignment. The ability to quantitatively reproduce enhanced experimental spectra with computations opens up new research areas, offering amongst else unique possibilities for the study of chiral structure of systems such as transition metal complexes and metalloproteins that so far remained intractable.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>

Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>

Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>
