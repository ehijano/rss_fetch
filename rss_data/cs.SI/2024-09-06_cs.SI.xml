      <title>Do We Trust What They Say or What They Do? A Multimodal User Embedding Provides Personalized Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of social media, the importance of analyzing social network user data has also been put on the agenda. User representation learning in social media is a critical area of research, based on which we can conduct personalized content delivery, or detect malicious actors. Being more complicated than many other types of data, social network user data has inherent multimodal nature. Various multimodal approaches have been proposed to harness both text (i.e. post content) and relation (i.e. inter-user interaction) information to learn user embeddings of higher quality. The advent of Graph Neural Network models enables more end-to-end integration of user text embeddings and user interaction graphs in social networks. However, most of those approaches do not adequately elucidate which aspects of the data - text or graph structure information - are more helpful for predicting each specific user under a particular task, putting some burden on personalized downstream analysis and untrustworthy information filtering. We propose a simple yet effective framework called Contribution-Aware Multimodal User Embedding (CAMUE) for social networks. We have demonstrated with empirical evidence, that our approach can provide personalized explainable predictions, automatically mitigating the impact of unreliable information. We also conducted case studies to show how reasonable our results are. We observe that for most users, graph structure information is more trustworthy than text information, but there are some reasonable cases where text helps more. Our work paves the way for more explainable, reliable, and effective social media user embedding which allows for better personalized content delivery.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Offline Models and Online LLMs in Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fake news detection remains a critical challenge in today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, where misinformation can spread faster than ever before. Traditional fake news detection models often rely on static datasets and auxiliary information, such as metadata or social media interactions, which limits their adaptability to real-time scenarios. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing these challenges due to their extensive pre-trained knowledge and ability to analyze textual content without relying on auxiliary data. However, many of these LLM-based approaches are still rooted in static datasets, with limited exploration into their real-time processing capabilities. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of both traditional offline models and state-of-the-art LLMs for real-time fake news detection. We demonstrate the limitations of existing offline models, including their inability to adapt to dynamic misinformation patterns. Furthermore, we show that newer LLM models with online capabilities, such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, are better suited for detecting emerging fake news in real-time contexts. Our findings emphasize the importance of transitioning from offline to online LLM models for real-time fake news detection. Additionally, the public accessibility of LLMs enhances their scalability and democratizes the tools needed to combat misinformation. By leveraging real-time data, our work marks a significant step toward more adaptive, effective, and scalable fake news detection systems.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms to improve fair information access in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When information spreads across a network via pairwise sharing, large disparities in information access can arise from the network's structural heterogeneity. Algorithms to improve the fairness of information access seek to maximize the minimum access of a node to information by sequentially selecting new nodes to seed with the spreading information. However, existing algorithms are computationally expensive. Here, we develop and evaluate a set of 10 new scalable algorithms to improve information access in social networks; in order to compare them to the existing state-of-the-art, we introduce both a new performance metric and a new benchmark corpus of networks. Additionally, we investigate the degree to which algorithm performance on minimizing information access gaps can be predicted ahead of time from features of a network's structure. We find that while no algorithm is strictly superior to all others across networks, our new scalable algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art and orders of magnitude faster. We introduce a meta-learner approach that learns which of the fast algorithms is best for a specific network and is on average only 20% less effective than the state-of-the-art performance on held-out data, while about 75-130 times faster. Furthermore, on about 20% of networks the meta-learner's performance exceeds the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>What is Normal? A Big Data Observational Science Model of Anonymized Internet Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding what is normal is a key aspect of protecting a domain. Other domains invest heavily in observational science to develop models of normal behavior to better detect anomalies. Recent advances in high performance graph libraries, such as the GraphBLAS, coupled with supercomputers enables processing of the trillions of observations required. We leverage this approach to synthesize low-parameter observational models of anonymized Internet traffic with a high regard for privacy.</description>

      <title>Commute-Time-Optimised Graphs for GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore graph rewiring methods that optimise commute time. Recent graph rewiring approaches facilitate long-range interactions in sparse graphs, making such rewirings commute-time-optimal on average. However, when an expert prior exists on which node pairs should or should not interact, a superior rewiring would favour short commute times between these privileged node pairs. We construct two synthetic datasets with known priors reflecting realistic settings, and use these to motivate two bespoke rewiring methods that incorporate the known prior. We investigate the regimes where our rewiring improves test performance on the synthetic datasets. Finally, we perform a case study on a real-world citation graph to investigate the practical implications of our work.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Aware Augmentation for Enhanced Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in learning representations on graphs in recent years. To generate ideal augmentation views, the augmentation generation methods should preserve essential information while discarding less relevant details for downstream tasks. However, current augmentation methods usually involve random topology corruption in the spatial domain, which fails to adequately address information spread across different frequencies in the spectral domain. Our preliminary study highlights this issue, demonstrating that spatial random perturbations impact all frequency bands almost uniformly. Given that task-relevant information typically resides in specific spectral regions that vary across graphs, this one-size-fits-all approach can pose challenges. We argue that indiscriminate spatial random perturbation might unintentionally weaken task-relevant information, reducing its effectiveness.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose applying perturbations selectively, focusing on information specific to different frequencies across diverse graphs. In this paper, we present GASSER, a model that applies tailored perturbations to specific frequencies of graph structures in the spectral domain, guided by spectral hints. Through extensive experimentation and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the augmentation views generated by GASSER are adaptive, controllable, and intuitively aligned with the homophily ratios and spectrum of graph structures.</description>

      <title>Exposing and Explaining Fake News On-the-Fly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms enable the rapid dissemination and consumption of information. However, users instantly consume such content regardless of the reliability of the shared data. Consequently, the latter crowdsourcing model is exposed to manipulation. This work contributes with an explainable and online classification method to recognize fake news in real-time. The proposed method combines both unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning approaches with online created lexica. The profiling is built using creator-, content- and context-based features using Natural Language Processing techniques. The explainable classification mechanism displays in a dashboard the features selected for classification and the prediction confidence. The performance of the proposed solution has been validated with real data sets from Twitter and the results attain 80 % accuracy and macro F-measure. This proposal is the first to jointly provide data stream processing, profiling, classification and explainability. Ultimately, the proposed early detection, isolation and explanation of fake news contribute to increase the quality and trustworthiness of social media contents.</description>

      <title>Explainable Hierarchical Urban Representation Learning for Commuting Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commuting flow prediction is an essential task for municipal operations in the real world. Previous studies have revealed that it is feasible to estimate the commuting origin-destination (OD) demand within a city using multiple auxiliary data. However, most existing methods are not suitable to deal with a similar task at a large scale, namely within a prefecture or the whole nation, owing to the increased number of geographical units that need to be maintained. In addition, region representation learning is a universal approach for gaining urban knowledge for diverse metropolitan downstream tasks. Although many researchers have developed comprehensive frameworks to describe urban units from multi-source data, they have not clarified the relationship between the selected geographical elements. Furthermore, metropolitan areas naturally preserve ranked structures, like cities and their inclusive districts, which makes elucidating relations between cross-level urban units necessary. Therefore, we develop a heterogeneous graph-based model to generate meaningful region embeddings at multiple spatial resolutions for predicting different types of inter-level OD flows. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using real-world aggregated mobile phone datasets collected from Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The results indicate that our proposed model outperforms existing models in terms of a uniform urban structure. We extend the understanding of predicted results using reasonable explanations to enhance the credibility of the model.</description>
