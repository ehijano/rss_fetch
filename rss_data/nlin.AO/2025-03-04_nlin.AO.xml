      <title>Stochastic Description of Dynamical Traps in Human Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel model for dynamical traps in intermittent human control is proposed. It describes probabilistic, step-wise transitions between two modes of a subject's behavior - active and passive phases in controlling an object's dynamics - using an original stochastic differential equation. This equation governs time variations of a special variable, denoted as $\zeta$, between two limit values, $\zeta=0$ and $\zeta=1$. The introduced trap function, $\Omega(\Delta)$, quantifies the subject's perception of the object's deviation from a desired state, thereby determining the relative priority of the two action modes. Notably, these transitions - referred to as the subject's action points - occur before the trap function reaches its limit values, $\Omega(\Delta)=0$ or $\Omega(\Delta)=1$. This characteristic enables the application of the proposed model to describe intermittent human control over real objects.</description>

      <title>Common indicators hurt armed conflict prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Are big conflicts different from small or medium size conflicts? To answer this question, we leverage fine-grained conflict data, which we map to climate, geography, infrastructure, economics, raw demographics, and demographic composition in Africa. With an unsupervised learning model, we find three overarching conflict types representing ``major unrest,'' ``local conflict,'' and ``sporadic and spillover events.'' Major unrest predominantly propagates around densely populated areas with well-developed infrastructure and flat, riparian geography. Local conflicts are in regions of median population density, are diverse socio-economically and geographically, and are often confined within country borders. Finally, sporadic and spillover conflicts remain small, often in low population density areas, with little infrastructure and poor economic conditions. The three types stratify into a hierarchy of factors that highlights population, infrastructure, economics, and geography, respectively, as the most discriminative indicators. Specifying conflict type negatively impacts the predictability of conflict intensity such as fatalities, conflict duration, and other measures of conflict size. The competitive effect is a general consequence of weak statistical dependence. Hence, we develop an empirical and bottom-up methodology to identify conflict types, knowledge of which can hurt predictability and cautions us about the limited utility of commonly available indicators.</description>

      <title>Black hole information turbulence and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major outstanding challenge in cosmology is the persistent discrepancy between the Hubble constant obtained from early and late universe measurements -- the Hubble tension. Examining cosmological evolution through the lens of information growth within a black hole we show the appearence of two fractal growing processes characterizing the early and late ages. These fractals induce space growth rates of $62.79\pm5.59$ km/s/Mpc and $70.07\pm0.09$ km/s/Mpc; close to the current values of the Hubble constants involved in the tension. These results strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is not given by unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors but by innate properties underlying the universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>An interpretable continuum framework for decision-making: nonreciprocal field theory of the shepherding control problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviors emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviors driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group of agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of distributed control. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from random to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems.</description>

      <title>Lateral Contrast Enhancement in Tomographic Volumetric 3D-Printing via Binary Photoinhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomographic volumetric 3D-printing (TVP) utilizes a nonlinear photoresponse of polymer precursor to cure all points in a three-dimensional (3D) object in parallel. A key challenge in TVP is to build up dose contrast between in-part and out-of-part points in a lateral plane, which relies on coordinated illumination from various projecting angles. This challenge has mainly been tackled by projection optimization. Here we show that designing material responses to photo-excitation can be a more effective way of addressing this challenge. By introducing a secondary photo-inhibitory species that reacts to external ultraviolet (UV) stimulus, we create a binary photoinhibition (BPI) system that greatly enhances the achievable dose contrast in a lateral plane. We first show that, in theory, combining dose subtraction with sufficient projection angles can guarantee an exact mathematical reconstruction of any greyscale design. We then propose a theoretical framework for BPI, in which a single stationary state with swappable stability can be used to realize dose subtraction. We use oxygen-lophyl radical pair as an approximation to show improvements in print quality enabled by enhanced dose contrast. In situ shadowgraphy shows that BPI improves the lateral patterning with various geometric features, creating differentiable changes in refractive index within 54 um or less. We show qualitative improvements in surface features and internal hollowness in physical prints. The direct impacts of UV light on the formation of positive and negative features on vertical and lateral planes of 5 workpieces are analyzed quantitatively. We conclude that introducing BPI with UV irradiation grants us direct control over the formation of negative features on the lateral plane.</description>

      <title>An exact solution for a non-autonomous delay differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11402v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution for a simple non-autonomous delay differential equation (DDE) over the entire real-time axis, representing it as a sum of Gaussian-shaped dynamics with distinct peak positions. This marks the first explicit solution for non-autonomous DDEs and is a rare example even among general DDEs. The constructed solution offers key physical insights and facilitates the analysis of system properties, such as the envelope profile of the dynamics.</description>
