      <title>A metric function for dual quaternion matrices and related least-squares problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving dual quaternion equations is an important issue in many fields such as scientific computing and engineering applications. In this paper, we first introduce a new metric function for dual quaternion matrices. Then, we reformulate dual quaternion overdetermined equations as a least squares problem, which is further converted into a bi-level optimization problem. Numerically, we propose two implementable proximal point algorithms for finding approximate solutions of dual quaternion overdetermined equations. The relevant convergence theorems %and computational complexity estimates have also been established. Preliminary simulation results on synthetic and color image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Non-Oblivious Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (sparse PCA) is a fundamental dimension-reduction tool that enhances interpretability in various high-dimensional settings. An important variant of sparse PCA studies the scenario when samples are adversarially perturbed. Notably, most existing statistical studies on this variant focus on recovering the ground truth and verifying the robustness of classical algorithms when the given samples are corrupted under oblivious adversarial perturbations. In contrast, this paper aims to find a robust sparse principal component that maximizes the variance of the given samples corrupted by non-oblivious adversarial perturbations, say sparse PCA with Non-Oblivious Adversarial Perturbations (sparse PCA-NOAP). Specifically, we introduce a general formulation for the proposed sparse PCA-NOAP. We then derive Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) reformulations to upper bound it with provable worst-case guarantees when adversarial perturbations are controlled by two typical norms, i.e., $\ell_{2 \rightarrow \infty}$-norm (sample-wise $\ell_2$-norm perturbation) and $\ell_{1 \rightarrow 2}$-norm (feature-wise $\ell_2$-norm perturbation). Moreover, when samples are drawn from the spiked Wishart model, we show that the proposed MIP reformulations ensure vector recovery properties under a more general parameter region compared with existing results. Numerical simulations are also provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed formulations.</description>

      <title>Power minimization and resource allocation in HetNets with uncertain channel-gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an optimization problem to minimize the base stations transmission powers in OFDMA heterogeneous networks, while respecting users' individual throughput demands. The decision variables are the users' working bandwidths, their association, and the base stations transmission powers. To deal with wireless channel uncertainty, the channel gains are treated as random variables respecting a log-normal distribution, leading to a non-convex chance constrained mixed-integer optimization problem, which is then formulated as a mixed-integer Robust Geometric Program. The efficacy of the proposed method is shown in a real-world scenario of a large European city.</description>

      <title>Tracking disturbances in transmission networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear inverse source problem of detecting, localizing and identifying unknown accidental disturbances on forced and damped transmission networks. A first result is that strategic observation sets are enough to guarantee detection of disturbances. To localize and identify them, we additionally need the observation set to be absorbent. If this set is dominantly absorbent, then detection, localization and identification can be done in "quasi real-time". We illustrate these results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic mechanics and virtual constraints on Riemannian homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonholonomic systems are, so to speak, mechanical systems with a prescribed restriction on the velocities. A virtual nonholonomic constraint is a controlled invariant distribution associated with an affine connection mechanical control system. A Riemannian homogeneous space is, a Riemannian manifold that looks the same everywhere, as you move through it by the action of a Lie group. These Riemannian manifolds are not necessarily Lie groups themselves, but nonetheless possess certain symmetries and invariances that allow for similar results to be obtained. In this work, we introduce the notion of virtual constraint on Riemannian homogeneous spaces in a geometric framework which is a generalization of the classical controlled invariant distribution setting and we show the existence and uniqueness of a control law preserving the invariant distribution. Moreover we characterize the closed-loop dynamics obtained using the unique control law in terms of an affine connection. We illustrate the theory with new examples of nonholonomic control systems inspired by robotics applications.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Optimal Control and Rough Fractional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations for Rough-Fractional Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a rough path-based approach to investigate the degeneracy problem in the context of pathwise control. We extend the framework developed in arXiv:1902.05434 to treat admissible controls from a suitable class of H\"older continuous paths and simultaneously to handle a broader class of noise terms. Our approach uses fractional calculus to augment the original control equation, resulting in a system with added fractional dynamics. We adapt the existing analysis of fractional systems from the work of Gomoyunov arXiv:1908.01747, arXiv:2111.14400v1 , arXiv:2109.02451 to this new setting, providing a notion of a rough fractional viscosity solution for fractional systems that involve a noise term of arbitrarily low regularity. In this framework, following the method outlined in arXiv:1902.05434, we derive sufficient conditions to ensure that the control problem remains non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Large problems are not necessarily hard: A case study on distributed NMPC paying off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key motivation in the development of distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) is to widen the computational bottleneck of centralized MPC for large-scale systems. Parallelizing computations among individual subsystems, distributed MPC has the prospect of scaling well for large networks. However, the communication demand may deteriorate the performance of iterative decentralized optimization, if excessively many optimizer iterations are required per control step. Moreover, centralized solvers often exhibit faster asymptotic convergence rates and, by parallelizing costly linear algebra operations, they can also benefit from modern multi-core computing architectures. On this canvas, we study the computational performance of cooperative distributed MPC for linear and nonlinear systems. To this end, we apply a tailored decentralized real-time iteration scheme to frequency control for power systems. For the considered linear and nonlinear benchmarks, distributed MPC and distributed Nonlinear MPC (NMPC) scale well as the required number of iterations does not depend on the number of subsystems. Comparisons with multithreaded centralized solvers show competitive performance of the considered decentralized optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Safe Paths and Sequences for Scalable ILPs in RNA Transcript Assembly Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common step at the core of many RNA transcript assembly tools is to find a set of weighted paths that best explain the weights of a DAG. While such problems easily become NP-hard, scalable solvers exist only for a basic error-free version of this problem, namely minimally decomposing a network flow into weighted paths.
  The main result of this paper is to show that we can achieve speedups of two orders of magnitude also for path-finding problems in the realistic setting (i.e., the weights do not induce a flow). We obtain these by employing the safety information that is encoded in the graph structure inside Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solvers for these problems. We first characterize the paths that appear in all path covers of the DAG, generalizing a graph reduction commonly used in the error-free setting (e.g. by Kloster et al. [ALENEX~2018]). Secondly, following the work of Ma, Zheng and Kingsford [RECOMB 2021], we characterize the \emph{sequences} of arcs that appear in all path covers of the DAG.
  We experiment with a path-finding ILP model (least squares) and with a more recent and accurate one. We use a variety of datasets originally created by Shao and Kingsford [TCBB, 2017], as well as graphs built from sequencing reads by the state-of-the-art tool for long-read transcript discovery, IsoQuant [Prjibelski et al., Nat.~Biotechnology~2023]. The ILPs armed with safe paths or sequences exhibit significant speed-ups over the original ones. On graphs with a large width, average speed-ups are in the range $50-160\times$ in the latter ILP model and in the range $100-1000\times$ in the least squares model.
  Our scaling techniques apply to any ILP whose solution paths are a path cover of the arcs of the DAG. As such, they can become a scalable building block of practical RNA transcript assembly tools, avoiding heuristic trade-offs currently needed on complex graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pfender \textit{[J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 2007]} provided a one-line proof for a variant of the Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel-Kabatianskii-Levenshtein upper bound for spherical codes, which offers an upper bound for the celebrated (Newton-Gregory) kissing number problem. Motivated by this proof, we introduce the notion of codes in pointed metric spaces (in particular on Banach spaces) and derive a nonlinear (functional) Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel-Kabatianskii-Levenshtein-Pfender upper bound for spherical codes. We also introduce nonlinear (functional) Kissing Number Problem.</description>

      <title>Private Algorithms for Stochastic Saddle Points and Variational Inequalities: Beyond Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a systematic study of stochastic saddle point problems (SSP) and stochastic variational inequalities (SVI) under the constraint of $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean setups. We first consider Lipschitz convex-concave SSPs in the $\ell_p/\ell_q$ setup, $p,q\in[1,2]$. Here, we obtain a bound of $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + \frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon}\big)$ on the strong SP-gap, where $n$ is the number of samples and $d$ is the dimension. This rate is nearly optimal for any $p,q\in[1,2]$. Without additional assumptions, such as smoothness or linearity requirements, prior work under DP has only obtained this rate when $p=q=2$ (i.e., only in the Euclidean setup). Further, existing algorithms have each only been shown to work for specific settings of $p$ and $q$ and under certain assumptions on the loss and the feasible set, whereas we provide a general algorithm for DP SSPs whenever $p,q\in[1,2]$. Our result is obtained via a novel analysis of the recursive regularization algorithm. In particular, we develop new tools for analyzing generalization, which may be of independent interest. Next, we turn our attention towards SVIs with a monotone, bounded and Lipschitz operator and consider $\ell_p$-setups, $p\in[1,2]$. Here, we provide the first analysis which obtains a bound on the strong VI-gap of $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + \frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon}\big)$. For $p-1=\Omega(1)$, this rate is near optimal due to existing lower bounds. To obtain this result, we develop a modified version of recursive regularization. Our analysis builds on the techniques we develop for SSPs as well as employing additional novel components which handle difficulties arising from adapting the recursive regularization framework to SVIs.</description>

      <title>Phantom Edges in the Problem Hamiltonian: A Method for Increasing Performance and Graph Visibility for QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. However, a key limitation of QAOA is that it is a "local algorithm," meaning it can only optimize over local properties of the graph for finite circuit depths. In this work, we present a new QAOA ansatz that introduces only one additional parameter to the standard ansatz, regardless of system size, allowing QAOA to "see" more of the graph at a given depth $p$. We achieve this by modifying the target graph to include additional $\alpha$-weighted edges, with $\alpha$ serving as a tunable parameter. This modified graph is then used to construct the phase operator and allows QAOA to explore a wider range of the graph's features for a smaller $p$. We derive a general formula for our new ansatz at $p=1$ and analytically show an improvement in the approximation ratio for cycle graphs. We also provide numerical experiments that demonstrate significant improvements in the approximation ratio for the Max-Cut problem over the standard QAOA ansatz for $p=1$ and $p=2$ on random regular graphs up to 16 nodes.</description>

      <title>Solving Hidden Monotone Variational Inequalities with Surrogate Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05228v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has proven to be effective in a wide variety of loss minimization problems. However, many applications of interest, like minimizing projected Bellman error and min-max optimization, cannot be modelled as minimizing a scalar loss function but instead correspond to solving a variational inequality (VI) problem. This difference in setting has caused many practical challenges as naive gradient-based approaches from supervised learning tend to diverge and cycle in the VI case. In this work, we propose a principled surrogate-based approach compatible with deep learning to solve VIs. We show that our surrogate-based approach has three main benefits: (1) under assumptions that are realistic in practice (when hidden monotone structure is present, interpolation, and sufficient optimization of the surrogates), it guarantees convergence, (2) it provides a unifying perspective of existing methods, and (3) is amenable to existing deep learning optimizers like ADAM. Experimentally, we demonstrate our surrogate-based approach is effective in min-max optimization and minimizing projected Bellman error. Furthermore, in the deep reinforcement learning case, we propose a novel variant of TD(0) which is more compute and sample efficient.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach using the stochastic projected gradient method and Malliavin calculus for optimal reinsurance and investment strategies. Unlike traditional methodologies, we aim to optimize static investment and reinsurance strategies by directly minimizing the ruin probability. Furthermore, we provide a convergence analysis of the stochastic projected gradient method for general constrained optimization problems whose objective function has H\"older continuous gradient. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Device Activity Detection with Massive MIMO for Near-Field Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the device activity detection problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for near-field communications (NFC). In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to the base station (BS), which detects the active devices based on the received signal. In this paper, we model the near-field channels as correlated Rician fading channels and formulate the device activity detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Compared to the traditional uncorrelated channel model, the correlation of channels complicates both algorithm design and theoretical analysis of the MLE problem. On the algorithmic side, we propose two computationally efficient algorithms for solving the MLE problem: an exact coordinate descent (CD) algorithm and an inexact CD algorithm. The exact CD algorithm solves the one-dimensional optimization subproblem exactly using matrix eigenvalue decomposition and polynomial root-finding. By approximating the objective function appropriately, the inexact CD algorithm solves the one-dimensional optimization subproblem inexactly with lower complexity and more robust numerical performance. Additionally, we analyze the detection performance of the MLE problem under correlated channels by comparing it with the case of uncorrelated channels. The analysis shows that when the overall number of devices $N$ is large or the signature sequence length $L$ is small, the detection performance of MLE under correlated channels tends to be better than that under uncorrelated channels. Conversely, when $N$ is small or $L$ is large, MLE performs better under uncorrelated channels than under correlated ones. Simulation results demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and verify the correctness of the analysis.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book aims to provide a brief overview of recent advancements in the theory of inverse problems for stochastic partial differential equations. In order to keep the content concise, we will only discuss the inverse problems of two typical classes of stochastic partial differential equations: second-order stochastic parabolic equations and secondorder stochastic hyperbolic equations. The main tool for studying these inverse problem is Carleman estimate. We do not intend to pursue any general treatment of the Carleman estimates themselves and choose direct arguments based on basic stochastic calculus, rather than more general sophisticated methods.
  As this field is still developing and there are many challenging issues to be addressed, the purpose of this book is not to serve as a comprehensive summary, but rather to spark interest and encourage further exploration in this area among readers. We prefer to present results that, from our perspective, include fresh and promising ideas. In cases where a complete mathematical theory is lacking, we only provide the available results. We do not intend for the current book to be encyclopedic in any sense, and the references are limited.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error analysis for stochastic gradient optimization schemes with first and second order modified equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic gradient optimization schemes. Assuming that the objective function is strongly convex, we prove weak error estimates which are uniform in time for the error between the solution of the numerical scheme, and the solutions of continuous-time modified (or high-resolution) differential equations at first and second orders, with respect to the time-step size. At first order, the modified equation is deterministic, whereas at second order the modified equation is stochastic and depends on a modified objective function. We go beyond existing results where the error estimates have been considered only on finite time intervals and were not uniform in time. This allows us to then provide a rigorous complexity analysis of the method in the large time and small time step size regimes.</description>

      <title>Rigidly breaking potential flows and a countable Alexandrov theorem for polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study all the ways that a given convex body in $d$ dimensions can break into countably many pieces that move away from each other rigidly at constant velocity, with no rotation or shearing. The initial velocity field is locally constant, but may be continuous and/or fail to be integrable. For any choice of mass-velocity pairs for the pieces, such a motion can be generated by the gradient of a convex potential that is affine on each piece. We classify such potentials in terms of a countable version of a theorem of Alexandrov for convex polytopes, and prove a stability theorem. For bounded velocities, there is a bijection between the mass-velocity data and optimal transport flows (Wasserstein geodesics) that are locally incompressible.
  Given any rigidly breaking velocity field that is the gradient of a continuous potential, the convexity of the potential is established under any of several conditions, such as the velocity field being continuous, the potential being semi-convex, the mass measure generated by a convexified transport potential being absolutely continuous, or there being a finite number of pieces. Also we describe a number of curious and paradoxical examples having fractal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of optimal transport relative to a distinguished subset, which acts as a reservoir of mass, allowing us to compare measures of different total variation. This relative transportation problem has an optimal solution and we obtain relative versions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality and Monge-Kantorovich duality. We also prove relative versions of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, which connect the spaces of measures arising from the relative optimal transport problem to spaces of Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <title>Sketched Equivariant Imaging Regularization and Deep Internal Learning for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We then extend our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework -- Sketched Equivariant Deep Image Prior (Sk.EI-DIP), which can be efficiently applied for single-image and task-adapted reconstruction. Our numerical study on X-ray CT image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve order-of-magnitude computational acceleration over standard EI-based counterpart in single-input setting, and network adaptation at test time.</description>

      <title>Controllability for a 2x2 nonlinear degenerate parabolic system via one boundary control force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the local boundary controllability for a non linear system of two degenerate parabolic equations with a control acting on only one equation. We analyze boundary null controllability properties for the linear system via the moment method by Fattorini and Russell, together with some results on biorthogonal families. Moreover, we provide an estimate on the null-control cost. This estimate let us prove a local exact boundary controllability result to zero of the nonlinear system following the iterative method from Lebeau and Robbiano as in \cite{Burgos_2020, Liu_2012}.</description>

      <title>Equitably allocating wildfire resilience investments for power grids: The curse of aggregation and vulnerability indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social vulnerability indices have increased traction for guiding infrastructure investment decisions to prioritize communities that need these investments most. One such plan is the Biden-Harris Justice40 initiative, which aims to guide equitable infrastructure investments by ensuring that disadvantaged communities defined by the Climate &amp; Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) receive 40% of the total benefit realized by the investment. However, there is limited research on the practicality of applying vulnerability indices like the CEJST to real-world decision-making for policy outcomes. In this paper, we study this gap by examining the effectiveness of vulnerability indices in a case study focused on power shutoff and undergrounding decisions in wildfire-prone regions. Using a mixed-integer program and a high-fidelity synthetic transmission network in Texas, we model resource allocation policies inspired by Justice40 and evaluate their impact on reducing power outages and mitigating wildfire risk for vulnerable groups. Our analysis reveals that the Justice40 framework may fail to protect certain communities facing high wildfire risk. In our case study, we show that indigenous groups are particularly impacted. We posit that this outcome is likely due to information losses from data aggregation and the use of generalized vulnerability indices. Through the use of explicit group-level protections, we are able to bound the best possible outcome for population groups that are proportionally most affected.</description>

      <title>Functionally Constrained Algorithm Solves Convex Simple Bilevel Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies simple bilevel problems, where a convex upper-level function is minimized over the optimal solutions of a convex lower-level problem. We first show the fundamental difficulty of simple bilevel problems, that the approximate optimal value of such problems is not obtainable by first-order zero-respecting algorithms. Then we follow recent works to pursue the weak approximate solutions. For this goal, we propose novel near-optimal methods for smooth and nonsmooth problems by reformulating them into functionally constrained problems.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for BSDEs with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to propose an extension of the deep solver by Han, Jentzen, E (2018) to the case of forward backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. As in the aforementioned solver, starting from a discretized version of the FBSDE and parametrizing the (high dimensional) control processes by means of a family of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the FBSDE is viewed as a model-based reinforcement learning problem and the ANN parameters are fitted so as to minimize a prescribed loss function. We take into account both finite and infinite jump activity by introducing, in the latter case, an approximation with finitely many jumps of the forward process. We successfully apply our algorithm to option pricing problems in low and high dimension and discuss the applicability in the context of counterparty credit risk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness holds a pivotal role in the realm of machine learning, particularly when it comes to addressing groups categorised by protected attributes, e.g., gender, race. Prevailing algorithms in fair learning predominantly hinge on accessibility or estimations of these protected attributes, at least in the training process. We design a single group-blind projection map that aligns the feature distributions of both groups in the source data, achieving (demographic) group parity, without requiring values of the protected attribute for individual samples in the computation of the map, as well as its use. Instead, our approach utilises the feature distributions of the privileged and unprivileged groups in a boarder population and the essential assumption that the source data are unbiased representation of the population. We present numerical results on synthetic data and real data.</description>

      <title>Optimization without Retraction on the Random Generalized Stiefel Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization over the set of matrices $X$ that satisfy $X^\top B X = I_p$, referred to as the generalized Stiefel manifold, appears in many applications involving sampled covariance matrices such as the canonical correlation analysis (CCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP). Solving these problems is typically done by iterative methods that require a fully formed $B$. We propose a cheap stochastic iterative method that solves the optimization problem while having access only to random estimates of $B$. Our method does not enforce the constraint in every iteration; instead, it produces iterations that converge to critical points on the generalized Stiefel manifold defined in expectation. The method has lower per-iteration cost, requires only matrix multiplications, and has the same convergence rates as its Riemannian optimization counterparts that require the full matrix $B$. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in various machine learning applications involving generalized orthogonality constraints, including CCA, ICA, and the GEVP.</description>
