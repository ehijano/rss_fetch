      <title>Probing Millikelvin Temperature Sensitivity in Chiral Nanoparticles via Optical Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing interest in utilizing nanostructures as nanoscale heat sources, the ability to precisely measure photothermal effects at the nanoscale has become increasingly significant. Techniques based on fluorescence or Raman signals often suffer from challenges in accurate calibration, far-field imaging methods are limited by diffraction-limited spatial resolution, and electron microscopy requires vacuum conditions, restricting in situ applicability. In contrast, tip-based measurement techniques offer sub-diffraction spatial resolution under ambient conditions, making them well-suited for nanoscale photothermal mapping. In this study, we employ tip-based optical force nanoscopy combined with phase-informed decomposition to investigate the origin of the photothermal force, enable nanoscale mapping, and evaluate temperature sensitivity. Our system achieves a temperature sensitivity of approximately 0.1 K without necessitating an additional temperature-sensitive layer. We anticipate that our approach has the potential to serve as a versatile platform for investigating localized thermal effects in fields such as semiconductors, nanophotonics, and photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Stress-driven photo-reconfiguration of surface microstructures with vectorial light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern formation driven by mechanical stress plays a fundamental role in shaping structural organization in both natural and human-made systems. However, achieving localized and programmable control of individual microstructures remains a challenge. Here, we present a vectorial field-guided lithography as a novel and versatile method for the photo-reconfiguration of photosensitive azopolymer microstructures. Building on the Viscoplastic PhotoAlignment model, recently proposed to describe the stress-driven response of azomaterials, we reveal structured polarization fields that are directly mapped into programmable surface architectures through stress-driven deformation. Using a digital polarization rotator implemented via a spatial light modulator, we prove the single-step fabrication of anisotropic, bent, and chiral microstructures from a single pre-patterned geometry, highlighting the power of polarization vector fields as active design parameters. Experimentally, we validate the theoretical model and demonstrate its predictive strength even under fully structured light, establishing for the first time a comprehensive theoretical framework capable of quantitively designing target morphologies. Our work demonstrates that the full vectorial nature of light, and not just its intensity, can dictate the mechanical reshaping of functional polymer surfaces, providing a new platform for the programmable design of complex micro-architectures with applications in photonics, microfluidics, and biology.</description>

      <title>Influence of Kerr Anisotropy in Parametric Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-wave parametric amplification can be extended to the TW/cm$^2$ regime using femtosecond pump pulses to amplify nearly octave spanning pulses with gain $&gt; 20$~mm$^{-1}$, which we call Kerr instability amplification. Cross-polarized wave generation exploits Kerr anisotropy to induce a transient intensity-dependent polarization evolution. In this work, we combine Kerr instability amplification with cross-polarized wave generation to simultaneously amplify and rotate the output polarization of a signal beam, and we explore laser and crystal parameters to control the resulting polarization. In 1~mm MgO(100), we amplify linearly polarized light by $2000\times$ orthogonal to the pump and seed polarization. The parametric amplification and polarization rotation offers excellent pulse contrast enhancement for future high-power laser systems. Furthermore, the polarization provides an additional observable to study the nonlinear dynamics occuring in this extreme ultrafast light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Broadband Low-loss Unidirectional Reflection On-chip with Asymmetric Dielectric Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface has emerged as a powerful platform for controlling light at subwavelength thickness, enabling new functionalities for imaging, polarization manipulation, and angular momentum conversion within a flat surface. We explored an integrated asymmetric metasurface simultaneously achieving broadband, low loss forward power transmission, and significant back reflection sup-pression in multi-mode waveguides. The tapering along the direction of light propagation leads to low loss and space-efficient mode conversion. Enhanced by a double-flipped structure, a thin (2.5 micrometer) metasurface can simultaneously achieve high conversion efficiency (&gt;80 percent), and back-reflection efficiency of 90 percent over a 200 nm wavelength range. Such single sided reflectors can be one of the enabling components for gain-integrated adaptive optics on a chip.</description>

      <title>Soliton eigenvalue control by interaction of circularly polarized lights in a nonlinear fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a physical method for controlling soliton eigenvalues in optical fibers, which is realized through the interaction between circularly polarized lights. Using this method, we not only achieve the decomposition of high-order solitons (HOSs) with different orders, but also realize physical processes of reconstructing HOSs for the first time. Compared with existing methods, our approach ensures accurate measurement of the discrete eigenvalues of HOSs while exhibiting higher decomposition efficiency. It is worth noting that the probe soliton, which induces these phenomena, plays a key role. The requirement for a moderate steepness of the probe suggests the presence of an uncertainty principle in the measurement of soliton eigenvalues, similar to the detection of microscopic particles. Our results can deepen the understanding of microscopic properties of solitons and their interaction mechanisms, and moreover provide a promising all-optical solution for the design of eigenvalue-based multiplexers and demultiplexers.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically induced grating based on strongly coupled disperse red1 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, optically responsive exciton-polariton were generated via strong coupling between DR1 molecules and an F-P microcavity. An electromagnetically induced grating (EIG) was constructed using two-beam interference to investigate EP modulation effects.EP formation was confirmed by transmission spectroscopy, angle-dependent measurements, and k-space reflection. Rabi splitting increased with DR1 concentration, indicating enhanced light-matter interaction. Under 532 nm laser illumination, reversible Rabi splitting changes occurred: upper/lower polariton peaks shifted by 16 nm-8 nm toward the 490 nm absorption peak with a 2% transmittance increase, recovering after laser removal.Introducing EP into EIG enhanced first-order diffraction intensity by 2-10 times compared to the non-coupled state, with peak positions shifting 8-30 nm under EP regulation. Diffraction angles varied within 2{\deg}, correlating with coupling strength. Compared with the bare DR1/PMMA film, the EIG diffraction signal of the strong coupling device was 2-7 times stronger, with clearer resolution and faster optical response near the resonance position, attributed to the enhanced light-matter interaction in the EP system.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Manufacturing-Guiding Spectrum-to-Structure Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that manipulate electromagnetic waves, having optical properties absent in natural materials. Recently, machine learning for the inverse design of metamaterials has drawn attention. However, the highly nonlinear relationship between the metamaterial structures and optical behaviour, coupled with fabrication difficulties, poses challenges for using machine learning to design and manufacture complex metamaterials. Herein, we propose a general framework that implements customised spectrum-to-shape and size parameters to address one-to-many metamaterial inverse design problems using conditional diffusion models. Our method exhibits superior spectral prediction accuracy, generates a diverse range of patterns compared to other typical generative models, and offers valuable prior knowledge for manufacturing through the subsequent analysis of the diverse generated results, thereby facilitating the experimental fabrication of metamaterial designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by successfully designing and fabricating a free-form metamaterial with a tailored selective emission spectrum for thermal camouflage applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Geometric Shifts in Wave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Berry's pioneering 1984 work, the separation of geometric and dynamic contributions in the phase of an evolving wave has become fundamental in wave physics, underpinning diverse phenomena in quantum mechanics, optics, and condensed matter. Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in their expectation values between the input and output wave sates. We describe this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry and dynamics in wave scattering and can be readily applied to a broad range of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Single-beam driven rotational manipulation for high-resolution 3D cellular morphology reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acquisition of multi-view information of cells is essential for accurate 3D reconstruction of their structures. Rotational manipulation of cells has emerged as an effective technique for obtaining such data. However, most reported methods require a trade-off between manipulation flexibility and system complexity These limitations significantly hinder their practical applicability. Recently, a novel approach has been proposed that enables simultaneous trapping and arbitrary-angle rotation of cells using a single optical beam carrying spin angular momentum (SAM). This method offers improved stability and manipulation flexibility, a simplified experimental setup, and supports coaxial alignment of the imaging and optical paths. In this paper, we employed this method to rotate cells and acquire multi-view images. Furthermore, we present a complete 3D reconstruction workflow, and validate the performance of the proposed method through the reconstruction of Punica granatum pollen cells and Prunus cerasifera cells. Our methods pave the way for 3D reconstruction of microscopic biological specimens, including but not limited to cells.</description>

      <title>Electrically reconfigurable nonvolatile flatband absorbers in the mid-infrared with wide spectral tuning range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent advances in reconfigurable photonics have provided new avenues for manipulating light on the subwavelength scale, on-demand control of infrared absorption remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a plasmonic metasurface based on the phase change material Ge2Sb2Te5 with in-situ electrically-switchable infrared absorption in the 3-5 microns wavelength range. Unlike traditional infrared microstructures based on volatile phase change materials, our device does not require the external stimuli to be continuously applied in order to maintain a given optical state, thus enabling zero static power operation. Furthermore, the 400x deep-subwavelength field localization supported by our device not only allows robust tuning of its spectral response but also makes its absorptivity independent of the angle of incidence, thus enabling a flatband behavior. We conduct switching of our device using rapid thermal annealing and reversible switching using electrical pulses over 26 cycles. Our device provides new avenues for infrared absorption control and serves as a steppingstone for the next generation of mid-wave infrared photonics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Solution for Skin Heating by an Electromagnetic Beam at an Incident Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature evolution in the three-dimensional skin tissue exposed to a millimeter-wave electromagnetic beam that is not necessarily perpendicular to the skin surface. This study examines the effect of the beam's incident angle. The incident angle influences the thermal heating in two aspects: (i) the beam spot projected onto the skin is elongated compared to the intrinsic beam spot in a perpendicular cross section, resulting in a lower power per skin area; and (ii) within the tissue, the beam propagates at the refracted angle relative to the depth direction. At millimeter-wavelength frequencies, the characteristic penetration depth is sub-millimeter, whereas the lateral extent of the beam spans at least several centimeters in applications. We explore the small ratio of the penetration depth to the lateral length scale in a non-dimensional formulation and derive a leading-term asymptotic solution for the temperature distribution. This analysis does not rely on a small incident angle and is therefore applicable to arbitrary angles of incidence. Based on the asymptotic solution, we establish scaling laws for the three-dimensional skin temperature, the skin surface temperature, and the skin volume in which thermal nociceptors are activated.</description>

      <title>Coherent Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of meta-grating with radiation asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of meta-grating are proposed, which is the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of the two outgoing beams under the simultaneous incidence of two coherent optical beams from opposite sides of the grating with the same lateral wave number. As both of the frequency and lateral wave number are resonant with a topological state of the meta-grating, such as unidirectionally guided resonance or circular polarized states, the energy flux and Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of the two outgoing beam highly depend on the relative phase difference between the two incident beams. The branches of unidirectionally guided resonance and circular polarized states are subset of the quasi-bound states in the continuum, which are obtained by simultaneously tuning multiple parameters from bound states in the continuum. As the unidirectionally guided resonance and circular polarized states approach the bound states in the continuum in the parameter space, the Q factor exponentially increases, which induces Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts with large magnitude.</description>

      <title>Isolated attosecond spatio-temporal optical vortices: Interplay between the topological charge and orbital angular momentum scaling in high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07465v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation properties and the nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) open new scenarios in high-harmonic generation (HHG), where the richness of the topological charge and OAM up-conversion are exposed. Through advanced numerical simulations, we demonstrate that HHG driven by spatio-spectral optical vortices produces far-field, extreme-ultraviolet STOV harmonics with non-scaling topological charge, i.e., with the same topological charge. This allows for the generation of attosecond STOVs, in contrast to previous works of HHG driven by STOVs, where the topological charge scales with the harmonic order. Our findings evidence that the scaling of the topological charge in HHG driven by spatio-temoral topological fields is not generally connected to that of the up-converted OAM. The up-converted intrinsic OAM does scale with generality with harmonic order in HHG, albeit this scaling does not necessarily imply its conservation.</description>

      <title>Information-guided optimization of image-based sensorless adaptive optics methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive optics (AO) are reconfigurable devices that compensate for wavefront distortions or aberrations in optical systems such as microscopes, telescopes and ophthalmoscopes. Aberrations have detrimental effects that can reduce imaging quality and compromise scientific information. Sensorless AO methods were introduced to correct aberrations without a separate wavefront sensor, inferring wavefront-related information directly from phase-diverse sample images. Most sensorless AO control systems, although effective and flexible to use, were operated based on empirical experience with suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduced a Fisher information-based analysis framework to provide information-guided method optimization. Results suggested that our framework can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of different sensorless AO methods. The framework is not specific to any AO method or imaging modality and has the potential to benefit a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable Coloration in Core-Shell Plasmonic Nanopixels Based on Organic Conductive Polymers: A First-Principles and FDTD Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From raindrops to planets, the scattering of electromagnetic fields introduces exciting phenomena that can be utilized for display devices. Here, we designed an electrochromic nanoparticle on mirror (eNPoM) structure with core-shell geometries for low-power nanoscale pixels with rapid coloration abilities based on four electrochromic organic conducting polymers utilizing the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Au nanoparticles are coated with electrochromic conductive polymers (such as PANI, PEDOT, PPy, and PTh) and positioned on the metal mirror. The electric field enhancement and the impact of shell thickness are analyzed. Dielectric properties of all polymers resulting from atomistic calculation were utilized for FDTD simulation, which helps to correlate the direct relationship between polymer structure and optical properties. Notably, the study reveals significant wavelength tunability of 100nm, 40nm, 70nm, and over 40nm using PANI, PEDOT, PPy, and PTh shells, respectively. Additionally, the potential for RGB color production using a TiN layer on the mirror is explored. For the first time, complex structures such as bow tie and gear were utilized to model the nanopixels studied and a significant absorption peak shift was observed. Chromaticity coordinates in the CIE 1931 color space and CIELAB2000 color difference quantify color change capabilities during the redox cycle, and a comparative analysis of organic and inorganic materials highlights the prospects of the proposed plasmonic nanopixels.</description>

      <title>Chiral Diffraction from Aperiodic Monotile Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aperiodic systems such as quasiperiodic systems exhibit unique properties different from periodic structures. In 2023, Smith et al. discovered a new aperiodic structure: a single-shaped tile that can only tile space aperiodically, known as an aperiodic monotile. Although the aperiodic monotile possesses intriguing mathematical properties, its experimental investigation remains unexplored. In this study, we report an experimental investigation of diffraction patterns from a monotile lattice using a nanophotonic platform. We observed clear Bragg peaks, which is evidence of long-range order and a chiral structure of the diffraction patterns. Furthermore, we found exotic behavior in circular polarization dependence, which cannot be observed in conventional quasiperiodic structures. These findings establish the monotile lattice as a novel class of aperiodic systems, expanding the study of nonperiodic structures beyond conventional quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Intense THz s-SNOM for nonlinearity engineering in nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) nonlinear optics offer powerful tools to investigate and manipulate electronic dynamics in condensed matter. Confining high-peak-power THz pulses within near field can effectively generates extremely localized electromagnetic fields in spatio-temporal, enabling to precisely explore and control carrier transient dynamics from THz nonlinearity perspective. However, the combination of the high peak power THz pulses and the near-field optic techniques remains challenging due to the incompatibility between low repetition THz pulses and typical near-field demodulation schemes. Here, we construct high peak power THz scattering scanning near-field microscopy (THz s-SNOM) by combining THz pulses emitted from two-color femtosecond laser filaments with a tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and explore efficient THz third harmonics generation (THG) from the Cd3As2 film in nanoscale. The power-law dependence of the THz harmonics and theoretical calculation reveals a convincing third harmonic generation that is attributed to the nonequilibrium intraband dynamics driven by the strong THz pulses. Especially, the nanoscopic near-field THz third harmonic imaging with resolution of 200 nm ({\lambda}/3000) of 3D Dirac semimetal are demonstrated. The high peak power THz s-SNOM can provide a great platform for exploring and manipulating the nonlinear physics, carrier dynamics and quantum coherent phenomena driven by the localized THz field with nanoscale resolution, thereby guiding the development of the integrated high-performance nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Closed-Form Driven Near-Field Flat-Top Beamfocusing with Concentric Circular Vertical Polarized Dipole Array For Large Intelligent Surface Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a near-field flat-top beam synthesis method based on a semi-closed-form approach. First, the feasibility of achieving a flat-top beam in the near field is examined using a closed-form analysis. A circular concentric ring array structure is adopted, and it is observed that circular rings with different radii exhibit distinct gain characteristics along the focal region on the z-axis. Specifically, smaller radii lead to a monotonic increase in electric field strength near the focus, whereas larger radii result in a monotonic decrease. Based on this behavior, parameters such as the number of rings and the initial radius are determined through field superposition. Subsequently, an optimization algorithm is employed to fine-tune the excitation amplitudes of the individual rings in order to suppress sidelobes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through full-wave electromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalized energy conservation relation for scattering of time-modulated waves, where conventional energy conservation does not hold. Based on this relation, we derive an optical theorem and compute the active power describing the power input or output due to scattering. Notably, the same system may be subject to energy gain, energy loss, or energy conservation depending on the frequency harmonics present in the wave field. Moreover, we show how the optical theorem derived herein may be used for image reconstruction based on measurements of the power. Notably, such measurements do not require information about the phase of the scattered field.</description>

      <title>Dense Associative Memory in a Nonlinear Optical Hopfield Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Hopfield Neural Networks (HNNs), also known as Dense Associative Memories (DAMs), enhance the performance of simple recurrent neural networks by leveraging the nonlinearities in their energy functions. They have broad applications in combinatorial optimization, high-capacity memory storage, deep learning transformers, and correlated pattern recognition. Thus far, research on DAMs has been primarily theoretical, with implementations limited to CPUs and GPUs. In this work, for the first time to our knowledge, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a nonlinear optical Hopfield neural network (NOHNN) system for realizing DAMs using correlated patterns. Our NOHNN incorporates effective 2-body and 4-body interactions in its energy function. The inclusion of 4-body interaction scores a minimum ten-fold improvement in the number of uncorrelated patterns that can be stored and retrieved, significantly surpassing the traditional capacity limit for traditional HNNs. For correlated patterns, depending on their average correlation, up to 50 times more patterns can be stored compared to traditional HNNs. To test the system's robustness, the benchmark testing is performed on MNIST handwritten digit patterns. The results show a 5.5 times improvement in the pattern storage along with the retrieval of cleaner and less noisy patterns. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear optical DAMs for practical applications in challenging big-data optimization, computer vision and graph network tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the spatio temporal weak measurement of a chiral ultrafast optical pulse. We create a chiral vector wave packet by transmitting ultrashort laser pulse via a birefringent or magneto-optic medium. Employing time-resolved leakage radiation microscopy, we examine how the real and imaginary components of the weak value parameter ($\epsilon$) influence pulse propagation over time. Our technique allows us to detect and categorize the temporal polarization fluctuation in a $75$ fs pulse with an excellent repeatability. The achieved experimental results demonstrate a satisfactory consistency with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of attosecond hard X-ray pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first direct experimental confirmation of attosecond pulse generation in the hard X-ray regime with a free-electron laser. Our experiment is based on measurements of a nonlinear optical phenomenon known as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from 3d transition metals. By analyzing the yield of the collective X-ray fluorescence induced by ultrashort pulses at the Linac Coherent Light Source, we identify the generation of attosecond pulses and shot-to-shot fluctuations in their duration, ranging from 100 as to 400 as. The observed product of bandwidth and pulse duration for 100 as pulses is approximately 2 fs$\cdot$eV, indicating the generation of nearly transform-limited pulses. Our results extend the photon energy reach of attosecond techniques by one order of magnitude, providing the ability to simultaneously probe matter on the time-scales of electronic phenomena and with atomic spatial resolution. Furthermore, attosecond hard X-ray pulses can outrun the fastest radiation damage processes, paving the way to single-shot damage-free X-ray measurements.</description>

      <title>Self-seeded photon acceleration by electron beam-driven transition radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon acceleration (PA) driven by ultra-relativistic electron beams offers a promising approach to generating high-power, high-frequency coherent radiation sources. While current methods typically rely on external optical laser pulses injected into beam-driven plasma wakefields, they face significant challenges in synchronization and alignment between electron accelerators and laser systems. We propose utilizing transition radiation (TR) generated by the drive electron bunch transversing the vacuum-gas interface as the seed photons of PA. Using a 1 GeV electron bunch, we demonstrate acceleration of TR from 4.4 {\mu}m to 184 nm in 1.6 mm of two-stage uniform plasma, achieving more than a 20-fold frequency boost. Further frequency increases can be achieved with optimized setups. This scheme addresses the synchronization and alignment issues present in previous approaches, providing a practical path toward beam-driven photon acceleration.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) wave packets, known for their vortex structure and nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), are of great interest in various scientific fields. Here we study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a spatially-localized electron LG wave packet interacting with an inhomogeneous external electric field that violates the axial symmetry of the initial wave function. We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its qualitative form. We demonstrate that due to the interaction with the external field, the degenerate zeros of the initial wave function located on the $z$ axis split into multiple nondegenerate nodes in the transverse plane representing separate single-charge vortices. This mechanism resembles the analogous effects known in topological optics. These findings provide new insights into controlling and manipulating twisted matter beams and into their possible instabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference in Two-Atom Resonant X-ray Scattering of an Intense Attosecond Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.</description>

Abstract: A new method for determining the condensate fraction and cluster density in absolute units has been proposed and tested for a supersonic argon jet, which can also be applied to supersonic jets of other gases. The method is based on measuring the absolute intensities of the Ar II resonance lines (93.2 and 92.0 nm) when the supersonic jet is excited by an electron beam with constant current density. Knowing the absolute intensities of the lines and their emission cross sections, we determined the density of the noncondensed atomic component in the supersonic argon jet and the evolution of the condensate fraction over the whole temperature range investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) quantum memory platform based on an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring trap and placed inside a Fabry-Perot cavity driven by Laguerre-Gaussian beams. In contrast to electromagnetically induced transparency-based protocols, our memory does not require change of internal atomic levels. The optical states are instead stored in the large Hilbert space of topologically protected and long-lived motional states (persistent currents) of the condensate, yielding a storage time three orders of magnitude better than presently available. Further, the use of a cavity provides orders of magnitude more resonances, and hence bandwidth, for reading and writing than internal atomic transitions. Finally, the analogy to cavity optomechanics suggests a natural path to wavelength conversion, OAM transduction, and nondestructive readout of the memory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum emitters serve as essential on-demand photonic resources, generating quantum states of light such as single photons and entangled photon pairs while serving as interfaces between light and matter. Buried in the solid state, quantum emitters enable a straightforward adoption of advanced nanofabrication techniques, facilitating precise engineering of their photonic environment for scalable quantum technologies. In this review, we introduce the fundamentals of quantum emitters and the key metrics characterising their performance. We highlight three material platforms: quantum dots, defect centres in diamond, and defect centres in silicon carbide. We summarise the recent developments of these platforms and discuss their advancements in quantum applications, including quantum communication, computation, and sensing. Finally, we provide a comparison across the three platforms, along with an outlook on future directions and potential challenges.</description>

      <title>Nickel Doping Unlocks Ambient-condition Photostability in Individual Cesium Lead Bromide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient single-photon sources is fundamental to advancing photonic quantum technologies. In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, high-rate, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here, the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel doped (Ni doped) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) is presented using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 minutes under ambient conditions with environment humidity of ~55%, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (&gt;99%) with a narrow emission linewidth (~70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions. These findings mark a significant step toward scalable, cost-effective quantum light sources for real-world applications, paving the way for robust quantum communication systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Topologically Distinct Berry Phases in a Single Triangular M\"obius Microwave Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of two distinct Berry phases ($+\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$) generated on the surface of a M\"{o}bius cavity resonator at microwave frequencies supporting the TE$_{1,0,n}$ mode family. This resonator consists of a twisted, mirror-asymmetric prism with a cross-section of the triangular $D_3$ symmetry group, bent around on itself to form a ring. This geometric class supports resonant modes with non-zero electromagnetic helicity (i.e. nonzero $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ product) at microwave frequencies. There exist modes with three-fold rotational symmetry as well as those that exhibit no rotational symmetry. The latter result in an accumulated Berry phase whilst the former do not, which is determined from the measured frequency shift of the modes when compared to a mirror-symmetric resonator of otherwise equivalent geometry.</description>

      <title>Generating phase singularities using surface exciton polaritons in an organic natural hyperbolic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface polaritons (SPs) are electromagnetic waves bound to a surface through their interaction with charge carriers in the surface material. Hyperbolic SPs can be supported by optically anisotropic materials where the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivies have opposite signs. Here we report what we believe to be the first experimental study of hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons (HSEPs). We study the intensity and phase response of HSEPs in the J-aggregate TDBC (a type-II natural hyperbolic material). HSEPs can be used to generate phase singularities; the behaviour of these phase singularities is a consequence of the hyperbolic nature of TDBC. The combined intensity and phase response of non-hyperbolic and hyperbolic SPs suggests that they are topologically distinct. We predict analogous effects for hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride. Our work suggests that organic materials can provide a new platform for the exploration of hyperbolic surface polaritonics at visible frequencies.</description>

      <title>Stark Tuning and Charge State Control in Individual Telecom C-Band Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telecom-wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single-photons compatible with existing fiber-optic infrastructure. Emission in the low-loss C-band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we present the first demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in a InP-based $n^{++}$--$i$--$n^{+}$ heterostructure, fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine-structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single-photon character is confirmed via second-order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber-compatible quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Optical trapping based on microring resonators with transverse slot structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, optical manipulation has emerged as a highly successful tool in various fields, such as biology, micro/nanorobotics, and physics. Among the different techniques, the transverse slot optical waveguide has shown remarkable potential in enhancing the field and significantly improving optical trapping capabilities. Additionally, microring resonators have demonstrated the ability to enhance the field at specific resonance wavelengths, enabling the manipulation and capture of particles. In this study, we investigated the impact of the structure on nanoparticle capture by introducing a 50 nm transverse slot in a 5 {\mu}m microring resonator. Through the integration of a transverse slot in the microring resonator, we observed a substantial increase in the maximum bound optical power for a nanosphere with a refractive index of 1.6 and a diameter of 50 nm, reaching 3988.8 pN/W. This value is 2292 times higher than the maximum optical force in a straight waveguide and 2.266 times higher than the maximum optical force in a microring resonator. The proposed structure significantly enhances the optical trapping capabilities for nanoscale particles, thus paving the way for the development of advanced micro/nanomanipulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Spatial super-resolution in nanosensing with blinking emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method of spatial resolution enhancement in metrology (thermometry, magnetometry, pH estimation, and similar methods) with blinking fluorescent nanosensors by combining sensing with super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). To demonstrate efficiency of this approach, both numerical simulations and a model experiment with laser diodes, which model fluctuating nanoemitters, and intentional blurring of the image are performed. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order cumulant images provide improvement of the contrast and enable successful reconstruction of smaller features of the modeled temperature (or any other physical parameter) distribution relatively to the intensity-based approach. We believe that blinking fluorescent sensing agents being complemented with the developed image analysis technique could be utilized routinely in the life science sector for recognizing the local changes in the spectral response of blinking fluorophores, e.g. delivered targetly to the wanted cell or even organelle. It is extremely useful for the local measurements of living cells' physical parameters changes due to applying any external "forces", including disease effect, aging, healing, or response to the treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic driving of particles can create crystalline structures in their dynamics. Such systems can be used to study solid-state physics phenomena in the time domain. In addition, it is possible to realize photonic time crystals and to engineer the wave-number band structure of optical devices by periodic temporal modulation of the properties of light-propagating media. Here we introduce a versatile approach which uses traveling wave resonators to emulate various condensed matter phases in the time dimension. This is achieved by utilizing temporal modulation of the permittivity and the shape of small segments of the resonators. The required frequency and depth of the modulation are experimentally achievable which opens a pathway for the practical realisation of crystalline structures in time in microwave and in optical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative and reproducible optical characterization of single quantum emitters is crucial for quantum photonic materials research, yet controlling for experimental conditions remains challenging due to a lack of an established reference standard. We propose nanodiamonds containing single nitrogen vacancy (NV$^{-}$) color centers as reliable, stable and robust sources of single-photon emission. We select 4 potential reference emitter candidates from a study of thousands of NV$^{-}$ centers. Candidates were remeasured at a second laboratory, correlating optical pump power and NV$^{-}$ center emission intensity at saturation in addition to corresponding $g^{(2)}(0)$ values. A reference nanodiamond is demonstrated to control for experimental conditions, with reproducible and reliable single-photon emission, as a model for a new single-photon emitter reference standard.</description>

      <title>Highly Uniform Thermally Undercut Silicon Photonic Devices in a 300 mm CMOS Foundry Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon photonic devices fundamental to high-density wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) optical links and photonic switching networks, such as resonant modulators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), are highly sensitive to fabrication variations and operational temperature swings. However, thermal tuning to compensate for fabrication and operational temperature variations can result in prohibitive power consumption, challenging the scalability of energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In this work, we develop and demonstrate a wafer-scale thermal undercut process in a 300 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry that dramatically improves the thermal isolation of thermo-optic devices by selectively removing substrate material beneath the waveguides and resonators. This approach significantly reduces the power required for thermal tuning across multiple device architectures, achieving almost a 5$\times$ improvement in tuning efficiency in a state-of-the-art 4.5 $\mu$m radius microdisk modulator and a 40$\times$ improvement in efficiency for a MZI phase shifter. To the best of the authors' knowledge, we demonstrate the first wafer-scale comparison of non-undercut and undercut silicon photonic devices using comprehensive wafer-scale measurements across 64 reticles of a 300 mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. Further, we demonstrate a comprehensive wafer-scale analysis of the influence of undercut trench opening geometry on device tuning efficiency. Notably, we observe highly uniform performance across the full 300 mm wafer for multiple device types, emphasizing that our process can be scaled to large-scale photonic circuits with high yield. These results open new opportunities for large-scale integrated photonic circuits using thermo-optic devices, paving the way for scalable, low-power silicon photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Low-loss silicon nitride Kerr-microresonators fabricated with metallic etch masks via metal lift-off</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stoichiometric silicon nitride has emerged as a widely used integrated photonic material owing to its high index of refraction, nonlinear optical properties, and broad transparency window spanning visible to mid-IR frequencies. However, silicon nitride is generally more resistant to reactive ion etching than are typical etch masks made of polymer-based resist. This necessitates resist layers that are significantly thicker than the silicon nitride and results in mask patterns which are tall and narrow. These high-aspect-ratio patterns inhibit the plasma transport of reactive ion etching, which leads to difficulties in accurately reproducing dimensions and creating well-defined, vertical waveguide sidewalls. In this work, we overcome these challenges by developing a metallic etch mask deposited via metal lift-off that provides a 30 : 1 nitride-to-metal etch rate ratio, representing a near 45-fold reduction in the required mask thickness. We demonstrate the validity of this technique by etching microring resonators with near-vertical waveguide sidewalls and intrinsic quality factors of over 1 million. Leveraging the low optical loss of our resonators, we generate optical frequency combs with more than an octave of bandwidth and dual dispersive waves. These results establish metal lift-off as a viable and easy-to-implement technique capable of producing low optical loss waveguides.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet interband plasmonics down to the vacuum UV with ultrathin amorphous silicon nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon dominates electronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photonics thanks to its suitable properties, abundance, and well-developed cost-effective manufacturing processes. Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from epsilon-near-zero plasmonic to surface plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.</description>

Abstract: Advancing the temporal resolution in computations, signal generation and modulation, and measurements is of paramount importance for pushing the boundaries of science and technology. Optical resonators have recently demonstrated the ability to perform computational operations at frequencies beyond the gigahertz range, surpassing the speed of conventional electronic devices. However, increasing the resonator length extends the operation time but decreases the temporal resolution, with current state-of-the-art systems achieving only picosecond resolution. Here we show that atoms and molecules belong to the class of widely-used passive resonators that operate without gain, such as subwavelength particles, electric circuits, and slabs, but with long operation times and, importantly, attosecond resolution. Our analysis reveals that when resonantly exciting atoms and molecules, the resulting scattered field is the integral of the incoming field envelope, with improvement factors in temporal resolution of a million and billion compared with optical resonators and electronic devices, respectively. We demonstrate our results theoretically for atoms and compare it with the standard slab resonator. Remarkably, our approach applies to all transition types including electronic, vibrational, rotational, and spin, with the same temporal resolution preserved across all frequencies. Our research paves the way for a new generation of devices operating on attosecond timescales and opens new avenues in fields such as computation, ultrafast phenomena, high-rate data transmission, encryption, and quantum technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale metasurfaces requires phase profiles beyond traditional hyperbolic designs. We show hyperbolic phase distributions cause spherical aberration from mismatched light propagation geometry and unrealistic phase assumptions. By analyzing metalens fundamentals via isophase surfaces, we develop a spherical phase profile based on spherical wavefront theory. This method prevents spherical aberration, essential for wide-aperture metalenses. Simulations prove superior focusing: spherical phase reduces FWHM by 7.3% and increases peak intensity by 20.4% versus hyperbolic designs at 31.46 micron radius. Spherical phase maintains consistent focusing across radii, while hyperbolic phase shows strong correlation (R squared = 0.95) with aberration. We also propose a normal vector tracing metric to measure design aberrations. This work establishes a scalable framework for diffraction-limited metalenses.</description>

Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum beats of a macroscopic polariton condensate in real space</title>

Abstract: We experimentally observe harmonic oscillations in a bosonic condensate of exciton-polaritons confined within an elliptical trap. These oscillations arise from quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the condensate, split in energy due to the trap's ellipticity. By precisely targeting specific spots inside the trap with nonresonant laser pulses, we control frequency, amplitude, and phase of these quantum beats. The condensate wave function dynamics is visualized on a streak camera and mapped to the Bloch sphere, demonstrating Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. We conclude that a qubit based on a superposition of these two polariton states would exhibit a coherence time exceeding the lifetime of an individual exciton-polariton by at least two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous imaging of vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>

Abstract: Light-induced molecular dynamics often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Since the ensuing electronic and nuclear motion determines the pathways and outcomes of photoinduced reactions, our ability to monitor and understand these dynamics is crucial for molecular physics, physical chemistry, and photobiology. However, characterizing this complex motion represents a significant challenge when different degrees of freedom are strongly coupled. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) and quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map the bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the consequences of nuclear motion for the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. Our results demonstrate that multi-coincident CEI can be an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode expansions of black hole perturbations: a hyperboloidal Keldysh's approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasinormal mode expansions by adopting a Keldysh scheme for the spectral construction of asymptotic resonant expansions. Quasinormal modes are first cast in terms of a non-selfadjoint problem by adopting, in a black hole perturbation setting, a spacetime hyperboloidal approach. Then the Keldysh expansion of the resolvent, built on bi-orthogonal systems, provides a spectral version of Lax-Phillips expansions on scattering resonances. We clarify the role of scalar product structures in the Keldysh setting, that prove non-necessary to construct the resonant expansions (in particular the quasinormal mode time-series at null infinity), but are required to define the (constant) excitation coefficients in the bulk resonant expansion. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the Keldysh spectral approach to (non-selfadjoint) dynamics, even beyond its limits of validity, in particular recovering Schwarzschild black hole late power-law tails. We also study early dynamics by exploring i) the existence of an earliest time of validity of the resonant expansion and ii) the interplay between overtones extracted with the Keldysh scheme and regularity. Specifically, we address convergence aspects of the series and, on the other hand, we implement non-modal analysis tools, namely assessing $H^p$-Sobolev dynamical transient growths and constructing $H^p$-pseudospectra. Finally, we apply the Keldysh scheme to calculate ''second-order'' quasinormal modes and complement the qualitative study of overtone distribution by presenting the Weyl law for the counting of quasinormal modes in black holes with different (flat, De Sitter, anti-De Sitter) spacetime asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Monitoring microplastics in live reef-building corals with microscopic laser particles</title>

Abstract: Micro- and nanoplastics pose a growing threat to reef-building corals. Yet, understanding of their uptake, interaction with coral tissue and long-term incorporation into coral skeletons remains limited in large part due to the invasive nature of existing methods for monitoring and localizing microplastic. Here, we repurpose optical resonances in polymer spheres to transform microplastic particles into microscopic lasers. These laser particles emit distinctive and stable spectral signatures that are used as optical barcodes and thus enable in vivo tracking of microplastics in optically opaque coral fragments. Simultaneously, they provide a platform for real-time sensing of dynamic changes at the microplastic surface with nanoscale resolution, shedding light on the internalization and transport of individual microplastic particles in live corals, e.g. as part of the complex marine food web.</description>

      <title>Fast Two-photon Microscopy by Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA)</title>

Abstract: Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscientists to study how large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed to image deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is computational imaging: the co-development of optics designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, with algorithms that compensate by inverting the optical coding to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopy video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the loss of information by 1) extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to effectively integrate the fluorescence of several lines into a single set of measurements and 2) imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame, NORA recovers full video sequences via nuclear-norm minimization on the pixels-by-time matrix, for which we prove theoretical guarantees on recovery. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulator, and used the simulations to demonstrate that NORA can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions. As NORA requires minimal changes to current microscopy systems, our results indicate that NORA can provide a promising avenue towards fast imaging of neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Localized surface plasmons in a Weyl semimetal nanosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of photonic spin Hall effect in the Rydberg atomic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.</description>
