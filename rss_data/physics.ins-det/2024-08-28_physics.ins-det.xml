      <title>Analysis of critical points of the In-Vessel Retention safety evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-Vessel Retention (IVR) strategy for nuclear reactors in case of a Severe Accident (SA) intends to stabilize and retain the corium in the vessel by using the vessel wall as a heat exchanger with an external water loop. This strategy relies on simple actions to be passively taken as soon as SA signal is raised: vessel depressurization and reactor pit flooding. Then, the strategy is successful if the vessel keeps it integrity, which means that the heat flux coming from the corium pool does not exceed the cooling capacity of the External Reactor Vessel Cooling (ERVC) at each location along the vessel wall (no vessel melt-through) and the ablated vessel wall is mechanically resistant. The main uncertainties in this IVR safety evaluation are associated to the thermal load applied from the corium pool to the vessel wall and the resulting minimum vessel thickness after ablation. Indeed, the heat fluxes distribution along the vessel wall is directly dependent on the corium stratification which occurs as aresult of thermochemical interactions in the pool: when liquid steel is mixed with UO2 and partially oxidized Zr coming from the degradation of the fuel and claddings, there is a phase separation between oxide and metal phases due to a gap of miscibility. The primordial impact of the corium behaviour in the lower plenum of the reactor vessel on the IVR safety evaluation was clearly highlighted in the Phenomena Identification Ranking Table (PIRT) on IVR performed in the frame of the European IVMR (In-Vessel Melt Retention) project (Fichot et al., 2019). As a result, the focus is made in this paper on the critical points which impact the value of the minimum vessel thickness orequivalently the maximum heat flux reached at the outer surface of the vessel wall. Efficiency of the ERVC and mechanical resistance of the vessel wall are consequently not discussed here.The main objective is to identify the generic critical situations leading to an excessive heat flux to the vessel wall and the investigation of possible means to avoid them. In this perspective, the calculations of IVR strategy done by the project partners for different reactor designs and accident scenarios were used as a database to identify and understand the occurrence of critical configurations with excessive heat flux to the vessel wall. The results of 25 sequences are used, which correspond to 9 different reactor designs: a generic PWR 900MWe, a PWR 1100MWe with heavy reflector, a generic PWR 1300MWe, a generic Konvoi 1300MWe, a generic German BWR69, aNordic BWR, a BWR-5 Mark II, a VVER1000 and a VVER440/v213. In addition, different SA integral codes (ASTEC, ATHLET-CD, MAAP -combined with MAAP_EDF and PROCOR codes for simulation of lower plenum behavior-, MELCOR and RELAP/SCDAPSIM codes) are used.</description>

      <title>Vertex Imaging Hadron Calorimetry Using AI/ML Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuations in energy loss to processes that do not generate measurable signals, such as binding energy losses, set the limit on achievable hadronic energy resolution in traditional energy reconstruction techniques. The correlation between the number of hadronic interaction vertices in a shower and invisible energy is found to be strong and is used to estimate invisible energy fraction in highly granular calorimeters in short time intervals (&lt;10 ns). We simulated images of hadronic showers using GEANT4 and deployed a neural network to analyze the images for energy regression. The neural network-based approach results in significant improvement in energy resolution, from 13 % to 4 % in the case of a Cherenkov calorimeter for 100 GeV pion showers. We discuss the significance of the phenomena responsible for this improvement and the plans for experimental verification of these results and further development.</description>

      <title>High-granularity Dual-readout Calorimeter: Evolution of a Classic Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original dual-readout calorimeter prototype (DREAM), constructed two decades ago, has proven instrumental in advancing our understanding of calorimetry. It has facilitated a multitude of breakthroughs by leveraging signals from complementary media (Cherenkov and scintillation) to capture fluctuations in electromagnetic energy fraction within hadronic showers. Over the years, extensive studies have shed light on the performance characteristics of this module, rendering it exceptionally well-understood. Drawing on this wealth of experience, we have embarked on enhancing the detectors' capabilities further by integrating fast silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) with finer transverse segmentation, $\sim$1 cm$^2$, as well as longitudinal segmentation by timing measuring better than 10 cm. This configuration will allow us to image hadronic showers with high granularity (HG-DREAM). We argue that the spatial information provided by such a granular detector in a short time window ($\approx$5 ns) leads to substantial enhancement in energy resolution when advanced neural networks are employed in energy reconstruction. We briefly present the current status of work, new concepts that have been introduced to the detector, and expectations from simulations.</description>

      <title>DWR-Drag: A new generation software for the Double Wall-Ring Interfacial Shear Rheometer's data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double wall-ring (DWR) rotational configuration is nowadays the instrument of choice regarding interfacial shear rheometers (ISR) in rotational configurations. Complex numerical schemes must be used in the analysis of the output data in order to appropriately deal with the coupling between interfacial and bulk fluid flows, and to separate viscous and elastic contribution or the interfacial response. We present a second generation code for analyzing the interfacial shear rheology experimental results of small amplitude oscillatory measurements made with a DWR rotational rheometer. The package presented here improves significantly the accuracy and applicability range of the previous available software packages by implementing: i) a physically motivated iterative scheme based on the probe's equation of motion, ii) an increased user selectable spatial resolution, and iii) a second order approximation for the velocity gradients at the ring surfaces. Moreover, the optimization of the computational effort allows, in many cases, for on-the-fly execution during data acquisition in real experiments.</description>

      <title>A roadmap for neutrino detection at LHC, HL-LHC and SPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SND@LHC is a new detector for neutrino physics at LHC. Its experimental configuration makes it possible to distinguish between all three neutrino flavours, opening a unique opportunity to probe physics of heavy flavour production at the LHC in the region that is not accessible to ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. It can also explore lepton flavour universality in the neutral sector, and search for feebly interacting particles. The detector has been commissioned and installed in 2021-2022. A first set of data has since then been collected, providing the first observation of neutrinos produced at a collider. This paper discusses the detector technologies being used to study high-energy neutrinos at the LHC, and their performance in terms of physics reach. The necessary upgrades to operate at high-luminosity LHC are presented, as well as a proposed experiment to perform neutrino measurements at the newly approved Beam Dump Facility.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared characterization of NbTiN superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors on silicon-on-insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used for detecting individual photons across various wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing their sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by applications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped NbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a 2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a wavelength of 3.5 {\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a dark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery time of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a silicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Resistance Standards by a Precision LCR Meter at Frequencies up to 2 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on two-terminal-pair and four-terminal-pair test measurements of a 10-kohm resistance standard by means of a commercial precision LCR meter at frequencies up to 2 MHz. In the case of a two-terminal-pair configuration, we demonstrate that the effect of 2.5 m long measuring cables, which are inevitable for some special applications, can be corrected in the whole frequency range up to 2 MHz with an uncertainty of 9E-6 (k = 1) relative to the dc resistance value. Furthermore, the systematic effects of the LCR meter were investigated. Though distinctly larger than the resolution of the LCR meter, these effects are accurately reproducible. As such it should be possible in the future to calibrate the LCR meter against a well-known calculable high-frequency resistance standard with an uncertainty close to the few-parts-per-million type-A uncertainty of the LCR meter.</description>

      <title>Embedded FPGA Developments in 130nm and 28nm CMOS for Machine Learning in Particle Detector Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17701v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedded field programmable gate array (eFPGA) technology allows the implementation of reconfigurable logic within the design of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). This approach offers the low power and efficiency of an ASIC along with the ease of FPGA configuration, particularly beneficial for the use case of machine learning in the data pipeline of next-generation collider experiments. An open-source framework called "FABulous" was used to design eFPGAs using 130 nm and 28 nm CMOS technology nodes, which were subsequently fabricated and verified through testing. The capability of an eFPGA to act as a front-end readout chip was assessed using simulation of high energy particles passing through a silicon pixel sensor. A machine learning-based classifier, designed for reduction of sensor data at the source, was synthesized and configured onto the eFPGA. A successful proof-of-concept was demonstrated through reproduction of the expected algorithm result on the eFPGA with perfect accuracy. Further development of the eFPGA technology and its application to collider detector readout is discussed.</description>

      <title>All-fiber microendoscopic polarization sensing at single-photon level aided by deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method accurate down to a single-photon level that provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of a biological specimen. Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>
