      <title>Uniform Ergodicity of Parallel Tempering With Efficient Local Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reversible parallel tempering (NRPT) is an effective algorithm for sampling from target distributions with complex geometry, such as those arising from posterior distributions of weakly identifiable and high-dimensional Bayesian models. In this work we establish the uniform (geometric) ergodicity of NRPT under a model of efficient local exploration. The uniform ergodicity log rates are inversely proportional to an easily-estimable divergence, the global communication barrier (GCB), which was recently introduced in the literature. We obtain analogous ergodicity results for classical reversible parallel tempering, providing new evidence that NRPT dominates its reversible counterpart. Our results are based on an analysis of the hitting time of a continuous-time persistent random walk, which is also of independent interest. The rates that we obtain reflect real experiments well for distributions where global exploration is not possible without parallel tempering.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Monte Carlo Algorithms in Dense Subgraph Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of network structures through the lens of graph theory has become a cornerstone in understanding complex systems across diverse fields. Identifying densely connected subgraphs within larger networks is crucial for uncovering functional modules in biological systems, cohesive groups within social networks, and critical paths in technological infrastructures. The most representative approach, the SM algorithm, cannot locate subgraphs with large sizes, therefore cannot identify dense subgraphs; while the SA algorithm previously used by researchers combines simulated annealing and efficient moves for the Markov chain. However, the global optima cannot be guaranteed to be located by the simulated annealing methods including SA unless a logarithmic cooling schedule is used. To this end, our study introduces and evaluates the performance of the Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA), which combines simulated annealing with the stochastic approximation Monte Carlo algorithm. The performance of SAA against two other numerical algorithms-SM and SA, is examined in the context of identifying these critical subgraph structures using simulated graphs with embeded cliques. We have found that SAA outperforms both SA and SM by 1) the number of iterations to find the densest subgraph and 2) the percentage of time the algorithm is able to find a clique after 10,000 iterations, and 3) computation time. The promising result of the SAA algorithm could offer a robust tool for dissecting complex systems and potentially transforming our approach to solving problems in interdisciplinary fields.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbors GParareal: Improving Scalability of Gaussian Processes for Parallel-in-Time Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of supercomputers, multi-processor environments and parallel-in-time (PinT) algorithms offer ways to solve initial value problems for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) over long time intervals, a task often unfeasible with sequential solvers within realistic time frames. A recent approach, GParareal, combines Gaussian Processes with traditional PinT methodology (Parareal) to achieve faster parallel speed-ups. The method is known to outperform Parareal for low-dimensional ODEs and a limited number of computer cores. Here, we present Nearest Neighbors GParareal (nnGParareal), a novel data-enriched PinT integration algorithm. nnGParareal builds upon GParareal by improving its scalability properties for higher-dimensional systems and increased processor count. Through data reduction, the model complexity is reduced from cubic to log-linear in the sample size, yielding a fast and automated procedure to integrate initial value problems over long time intervals. First, we provide both an upper bound for the error and theoretical details on the speed-up benefits. Then, we empirically illustrate the superior performance of nnGParareal, compared to GParareal and Parareal, on nine different systems with unique features (e.g., stiff, chaotic, high-dimensional, or challenging-to-learn systems).</description>

      <title>Real Time Monitoring and Forecasting of COVID 19 Cases using an Adjusted Holt based Hybrid Model embedded with Wavelet based ANN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of the SARS - CoV - 2 (COVID - 19) novel coronavirus, a lot of time and effort is being allocated to estimate the trajectory and possibly, forecast with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the number of cases, recoveries, and deaths due to the same. The model proposed in this paper is a mindful step in the same direction. The primary model in question is a Hybrid Holt's Model embedded with a Wavelet-based ANN. To test its forecasting ability, we have compared three separate models, the first, being a simple ARIMA model, the second, also an ARIMA model with a wavelet-based function, and the third, being the proposed model. We have also compared the forecast accuracy of this model with that of a modern day Vanilla LSTM recurrent neural network model. We have tested the proposed model on the number of confirmed cases (daily) for the entire country as well as 6 hotspot states. We have also proposed a simple adjustment algorithm in addition to the hybrid model so that daily and/or weekly forecasts can be meted out, with respect to the entirety of the country, as well as a moving window performance metric based on out-of-sample forecasts. In order to have a more rounded approach to the analysis of COVID-19 dynamics, focus has also been given to the estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number, $R_0$ using a compartmental epidemiological model (SIR). Lastly, we have also given substantial attention to estimating the shelf-life of the proposed model. It is obvious yet noteworthy how an accurate model, in this regard, can ensure better allocation of healthcare resources, as well as, enable the government to take necessary measures ahead of time.</description>

      <title>General bounds on the quality of Bayesian coresets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian coresets speed up posterior inference in the large-scale data regime by approximating the full-data log-likelihood function with a surrogate log-likelihood based on a small, weighted subset of the data. But while Bayesian coresets and methods for construction are applicable in a wide range of models, existing theoretical analysis of the posterior inferential error incurred by coreset approximations only apply in restrictive settings -- i.e., exponential family models, or models with strong log-concavity and smoothness assumptions. This work presents general upper and lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of coreset approximations that reflect the full range of applicability of Bayesian coresets. The lower bounds require only mild model assumptions typical of Bayesian asymptotic analyses, while the upper bounds require the log-likelihood functions to satisfy a generalized subexponentiality criterion that is weaker than conditions used in earlier work. The lower bounds are applied to obtain fundamental limitations on the quality of coreset approximations, and to provide a theoretical explanation for the previously-observed poor empirical performance of importance sampling-based construction methods. The upper bounds are used to analyze the performance of recent subsample-optimize methods. The flexibility of the theory is demonstrated in validation experiments involving multimodal, unidentifiable, heavy-tailed Bayesian posterior distributions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shapley Performance Attribution for Least-Squares Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the performance of a least-squares regression model, as judged by out-of-sample $R^2$. Shapley values give a fair attribution of the performance of a model to its input features, taking into account interdependencies between features. Evaluating the Shapley values exactly requires solving a number of regression problems that is exponential in the number of features, so a Monte Carlo-type approximation is typically used. We focus on the special case of least-squares regression models, where several tricks can be used to compute and evaluate regression models efficiently. These tricks give a substantial speed up, allowing many more Monte Carlo samples to be evaluated, achieving better accuracy. We refer to our method as least-squares Shapley performance attribution (LS-SPA), and describe our open-source implementation.</description>

      <title>Derivative-informed neural operator acceleration of geometric MCMC for infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an operator learning approach to accelerate geometric Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for solving infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). While geometric MCMC employs high-quality proposals that adapt to posterior local geometry, it requires repeated computations of gradients and Hessians of the log-likelihood, which becomes prohibitive when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is defined through expensive-to-solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). We consider a delayed-acceptance geometric MCMC method driven by a neural operator surrogate of the PtO map, where the proposal exploits fast surrogate predictions of the log-likelihood and, simultaneously, its gradient and Hessian. To achieve a substantial speedup, the surrogate must accurately approximate the PtO map and its Jacobian, which often demands a prohibitively large number of PtO map samples via conventional operator learning methods. In this work, we present an extension of derivative-informed operator learning [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] that uses joint samples of the PtO map and its Jacobian. This leads to derivative-informed neural operator (DINO) surrogates that accurately predict the observables and posterior local geometry at a significantly lower training cost than conventional methods. Cost and error analysis for reduced basis DINO surrogates are provided. Numerical studies demonstrate that DINO-driven MCMC generates effective posterior samples 3--9 times faster than geometric MCMC and 60--97 times faster than prior geometry-based MCMC. Furthermore, the training cost of DINO surrogates breaks even compared to geometric MCMC after just 10--25 effective posterior samples.</description>
