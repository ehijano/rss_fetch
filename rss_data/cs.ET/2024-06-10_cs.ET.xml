      <title>Quantum Communication: From Fundamentals to Recent Trends, Challenges and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancements and developments in quantum technologies, the emerging field of quantum communication and networking has gained the attention of the researchers. Owing to the unique properties of quantum mechanics, viz., quantum superposition and entanglement, this new area of quantum communication has shown potential to replace modernday communication technologies. The enhanced security and high information sharing ability using principles of quantum mechanics has encouraged networking engineers and physicists to develop this technology for next generation wireless systems. However, a conceptual bridge between the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, photonics and the deployability of a quantum communication infrastructure is not well founded in the current literature. This paper aims to fill this gap by merging the theoretical concepts from quantum physics to the engineering and computing perspectives of quantum technology. This paper builds the fundamental concepts required for understanding quantum communication, reviews the key concepts and demonstrates how these concepts can be leveraged for accomplishing successful communication. The paper delves into implementation advancements for executing quantum communication protocols, explaining how hardware implementation enables the achievement of all basic quantum computing operations. Finally, the paper provides a comprehensive and critical review of the state-of-the-art advancements in the field of quantum communication and quantum internet; and points out the recent trends, challenges and open problems for the real-world realization of next generation networking systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Precision in Tactile Internet-Enabled Remote Robotic Surgery: Kalman Filter Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the position of a patient's side robotic arm in real time in a remote surgery task is a significant challenge, particularly in Tactile Internet (TI) environments. This paper presents a Kalman Filter (KF) based computationally efficient position estimation method. The study also assume no prior knowledge of the dynamic system model of the robotic arm system. Instead, The JIGSAW dataset, which is a comprehensive collection of robotic surgical data, and the Master Tool Manipulator's (MTM) input are utilized to learn the system model using System Identification (SI) toolkit available in Matlab. We further investigate the effectiveness of KF to determine the position of the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM) under simulated network conditions that include delays, jitter, and packet loss. These conditions reflect the typical challenges encountered in real-world Tactile Internet applications. The results of the study highlight KF's resilience and effectiveness in achieving accurate state estimation despite network-induced uncertainties with over 90\% estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for RSMA-assisted mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been considered one of the new paradigms for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In the millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system, hybrid beamforming (HBF) is considered an emerging technology to exploit the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains in order to reduce the system hardware cost and power consumption. However, the HBF structure reduces the spatial degrees of freedom for the ISAC system, which further leads to increased interference between multiple users and between users and radar sensing. To solve the above problem, rate split multiple access (RSMA), which is a flexible and robust interference management strategy, is considered. We investigate the joint common rate allocation and HBF design problem for the HBF-based RSMA-assisted mmWave ISAC scheme. We propose the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method coupled with the weighted mean squared error (WMMSE) minimization method to solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem, which converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original problem. Then, we extend the proposed algorithm to the HBF design based on finite-resolution phase shifters (PSs) to further improve the energy efficiency of the system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that the RSMA-ISAC scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>RF-Photonic Deep Learning Processor with Shannon-Limited Data Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edholm's Law predicts exponential growth in data rate and spectrum bandwidth for communications and is forecasted to remain true for the upcoming deployment of 6G. Compounding this issue is the exponentially increasing demand for deep neural network (DNN) compute, including DNNs for signal processing. However, the slowing of Moore's Law due to the limitations of transistor-based electronics means that completely new paradigms for computing will be required to meet these increasing demands for advanced communications. Optical neural networks (ONNs) are promising DNN accelerators with ultra-low latency and energy consumption. Yet state-of-the-art ONNs struggle with scalability and implementing linear with in-line nonlinear operations. Here we introduce our multiplicative analog frequency transform ONN (MAFT-ONN) that encodes the data in the frequency domain, achieves matrix-vector products in a single shot using photoelectric multiplication, and uses a single electro-optic modulator for the nonlinear activation of all neurons in each layer. We experimentally demonstrate the first hardware accelerator that computes fully-analog deep learning on raw RF signals, performing single-shot modulation classification with 85% accuracy, where a 'majority vote' multi-measurement scheme can boost the accuracy to 95% within 5 consecutive measurements. In addition, we demonstrate frequency-domain finite impulse response (FIR) linear-time-invariant (LTI) operations, enabling a powerful combination of traditional and AI signal processing. We also demonstrate the scalability of our architecture by computing nearly 4 million fully-analog multiplies-and-accumulates for MNIST digit classification. Our latency estimation model shows that due to the Shannon capacity-limited analog data movement, MAFT-ONN is hundreds of times faster than traditional RF receivers operating at their theoretical peak performance.</description>
