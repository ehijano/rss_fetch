      <title>Randomized Controlled Trials for Phishing Triage Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security operations centers (SOCs) face a persistent challenge: efficiently triaging a high volume of user-reported phishing emails while maintaining robust protection against threats. This paper presents the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of a domain-specific AI agent - the Microsoft Security Copilot Phishing Triage Agent - on analyst productivity and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that agent-augmented analysts achieved up to 6.5 times as many true positives per analyst minute and a 77% improvement in verdict accuracy compared to a control group. The agent's queue prioritization and verdict explanations were both significant drivers of efficiency. Behavioral analysis revealed that agent-augmented analysts reallocated their attention, spending 53% more time on malicious emails, and were not prone to rubber-stamping the agent's malicious verdicts. These findings offer actionable insights for SOC leaders considering AI adoption, including the potential for agents to fundamentally change the optimal allocation of SOC resources.</description>

      <title>Randomized Controlled Trials for Conditional Access Optimization Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex enterprise workflows, yet evidence of their effectiveness in identity governance is limited. We report results from the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating an AI agent for Conditional Access (CA) policy management in Microsoft Entra. The agent assists with four high-value tasks: policy merging, Zero-Trust baseline gap detection, phased rollout planning, and user-policy alignment. In a production-grade environment, 162 identity administrators were randomly assigned to a control group (no agent) or treatment group (agent-assisted) and asked to perform these tasks. Agent access produced substantial gains: accuracy improved by 48% and task completion time decreased by 43% while holding accuracy constant. The largest benefits emerged on cognitively demanding tasks such as baseline gap detection. These findings demonstrate that purpose-built AI agents can significantly enhance both speed and accuracy in identity administration.</description>

      <title>HSBC 1950 to 2025: Conquering the world from British Hong Kong and London</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co (HSBC) just survived a civil war intermitted by World War II. By the 1950s, it obviously needed to close all its branches in Mao's People's Republic of China, yet could somehow hold its Shanghai branch, which continued likely in the shadows, as non-state banking was illegalised and even simple land owners were executed merely for being labelled "capitalist". This Asia-focused bank --in spite of it all-- grew from these conditions into the behemoth it is today. Part of the growth was based on the economic boom in its core market Hong Kong, to which HSBC likely also contributed. To expand and diversify, HSBC continued the growth strategy that already started since its early days in the 1860s, this time just also inorganically: It acquired other banks, in most cases fully and in other regions. The most important acquisition was the takeover of the roughly equally-sized UK-based Midland Bank; for the following reasons: 1) It came just a year after the 1991 change of HSBC's headquarters and place of incorporation to London, so HSBC could smoothly integrate with Midland. This step also came with an additional listing of securities in London, providing HSBC funds. 2) These funds were used efficiently without much idling for the humongous acquisition. 3) The preceding decade of Margaret Thatcher's banking and finance deregulation in the UK created a beneficial environment for HSBC. 4) HSBC was proven right by the developments in Hong Kong, where the Communist Party of China illegally eroded democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties since 2020, despite promising to maintain these at least until 1 July 2047. A list of likely reasons for HSBC's prosperity and stability in face of the at times hostile environments is also provided, from which business lessons can be drawn.</description>

      <title>Different Forms of Imbalance in Strongly Playable Discrete Games II: Multi-Player RPS Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classic Rock-Paper-Scissors, RPS, has seen many variants and generalizations in the past several years. In the previous paper, we defined playability and balance for games. We used these definitions to show that different forms of imbalance agree on the most balanced and least balanced form of playable two-player n-object RPS games, referred to as (2,n)-RPS. We reintroduce these definitions here and show that, given a conjecture, the generalization of this game for m&lt;50 players is a strongly playable RPS game. We also show that this game maximizes these forms of imbalance in the limit as the number of players goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>US Code growth 1991-2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first scientific article since 2010 counting the words which are effective and permanent federal law in the United States (US) Code. The latest version of the US Code --published in 2025-- is the largest since 1991, encompassing over 24.4 million words. The low since 1991 was 1993 at roughly 15 million words. The word count grew in 30 out of 33 years. The average characters per word --potentially indicative of complexity-- grew even in all 33 years. The research also touches upon why it is undesirable for laws to be longer and longer and mentions possible remedies.</description>

      <title>When AI Democratizes Exploitation: LLM-Assisted Strategic Manipulation of Fair Division Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair resource division algorithms, like those implemented in Spliddit platform, have traditionally been considered difficult for the end users to manipulate due to its complexities. This paper demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can dismantle these protective barriers by democratizing access to strategic expertise. Through empirical analysis of rent division scenarios on Spliddit algorithms, we show that users can obtain actionable manipulation strategies via simple conversational queries to AI assistants. We present four distinct manipulation scenarios: exclusionary collusion where majorities exploit minorities, defensive counterstrategies that backfire, benevolent subsidization of specific participants, and cost minimization coalitions. Our experiments reveal that LLMs can explain algorithmic mechanics, identify profitable deviations, and generate specific numerical inputs for coordinated preference misreporting--capabilities previously requiring deep technical knowledge. These findings extend algorithmic collective action theory from classification contexts to resource allocation scenarios, where coordinated preference manipulation replaces feature manipulation. The implications reach beyond rent division to any domain using algorithmic fairness mechanisms for resource division. While AI-enabled manipulation poses risks to system integrity, it also creates opportunities for preferential treatment of equity deserving groups. We argue that effective responses must combine algorithmic robustness, participatory design, and equitable access to AI capabilities, acknowledging that strategic sophistication is no longer a scarce resource.</description>

      <title>The labour and resource use requirements of a good life for all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use multi-regional input-output analysis to calculate the paid labour, energy, emissions, and material use required to provide basic needs for all people. We calculate two different low-consumption scenarios, using the UK as a case study: (1) a "decent living" scenario, which includes only the bare necessities, and (2) a "good life" scenario, based on the minimum living standards demanded by UK residents. We compare the resulting footprints to the current footprint of the UK, and to the footprints of the US, China, India, and a global average. Labour footprints are disaggregated by sector, skill level, and region of origin.
  We find that neither low-consumption scenario provides a realistic path to providing a good life for all. While the decent living scenario would require only an 18-hour working week, and on a per capita basis, 35 GJ of energy use, 4.0 tonnes of emissions, and 5.5 tonnes of materials per year, it fails to provide essential needs. The good life scenario encompasses these needs, but would require a 46-hour working week, 73 GJ of energy use, 7.5 tonnes of emissions, and 13.2 tonnes of materials per capita. Both scenarios represent substantial reductions from the UK's current labour footprint of 65 hours per week, which the UK is only able to sustain by importing a substantial portion of its labour from other countries. We conclude that limiting consumption to the level of basic needs is not enough to achieve sustainability. Substantial changes to provisioning systems are also required.</description>

      <title>The Geopolitical Determinants of Economic Growth, 1960-2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes geopolitical relations as a first-order determinant of economic growth. We construct a novel event-based measure of bilateral geopolitical alignment by employing large language models with web search capabilities to analyze over 440,000 political events across 196 countries from 1960 to 2019. This comprehensive measure enables us to identify the precise timing and magnitude of geopolitical shifts. Exploiting within-country temporal variation, we find that a one-standard-deviation improvement in geopolitical relations increases GDP per capita by 10 percent over 15 years. These persistent effects operate through multiple reinforcing channels: enhanced political stability, increased investment, expanded trade, and productivity gains. Geopolitical factors account for GDP variations ranging from -35 to +30 percent across countries over our sample period, with developing nations exhibiting particularly severe penalties from international isolation.</description>

      <title>Can Machines Think Like Humans? A Behavioral Evaluation of LLM Agents in Dictator Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly engage with human society, how well do we understand their prosocial behaviors? We (1) investigate how LLM agents' prosocial behaviors can be induced by different personas and benchmarked against human behaviors; and (2) introduce a social science approach to evaluate LLM agents' decision-making. We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. The findings reveal that merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. These findings suggest that LLM agents' reasoning does not consistently exhibit textual markers of human decision-making in dictator games and that their alignment with human behavior varies substantially across model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern. As society increasingly integrates machine intelligence, "Prosocial AI" emerges as a promising and urgent research direction in philanthropic studies.</description>
