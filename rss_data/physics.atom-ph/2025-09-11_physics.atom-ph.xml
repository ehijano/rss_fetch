      <title>Fast simulation of fermions with reconfigurable qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performing large-scale, accurate quantum simulations of many-fermion systems is a central challenge in quantum science, with applications in chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics. Despite significant progress, realizing generic fermionic algorithms with qubit systems incurs significant space-time overhead, scaling as O(N) for N fermionic modes. Here we present a method for faster fermionic simulation with asymptotic space-time overhead of O(log(N)) in the worst case, and O(1) for circuits with additional structure, including important subroutines like the fermionic fast Fourier transform. This exponential reduction is achieved by using reconfigurable quantum systems with non-local connectivity, mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedforward, to generate dynamical fermion-to-qubit mappings. We apply this technique to achieve efficient compilation for key simulation tasks, including Hamiltonian simulation of the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and periodic materials, as well as free-fermion state-preparation. Moreover, we show that the algorithms themselves can be adapted to use only the O(1)-overhead structures to further reduce resource overhead. These techniques can lower gate counts by orders of magnitude for practical system sizes and are natively compatible with error corrected computation, making them ideal for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. Our results tightly bound the computational gap between fermionic and qubit models and open new directions in quantum simulation algorithm design and implementation.</description>

      <title>Multi-laser stabilization with an atomic-disciplined photonic integrated resonator</title>

Abstract: Precision atomic and quantum experiments rely on ultra-stable narrow linewidth lasers constructed using table-top ultra-low expansion reference cavities. These experiments often require multiple lasers, operating at different wavelengths, to perform key steps used in state preparation and measurement required in quantum sensing and computing. This is traditionally achieved by disciplining a cavity-stabilized laser to a key atomic transition and then transferring the transition linewidth and stability to other lasers using the same reference cavity in combination with bulk-optic frequency shifting such as acousto-optic modulators. Transitioning such capabilities to a low cost photonic-integrated platform will enable a wide range of portable, low power, scalable quantum experiments and applications. Yet, today's bulk optic approaches pose challenges related to lack of cavity tunability, large free spectral range, and limited photonic integration potential. Here, we address these challenges with demonstration of an agile photonic-integrated 780 nm ultra-high-Q tunable silicon nitride reference cavity that performs multiple critical experimental steps including laser linewidth narrowing, high resolution rubidium spectroscopy, dual-stage stabilization to a rubidium transition, and stability transfer to other lasers. We achieve up to 20 dB of frequency noise reduction at 10 kHz offset, precision spectroscopy over a 250 MHz range, and dual-stage locking to rubidium with an Allan deviation of $8.5 \times 10^{-12}$ at 1 s and up to 40 dB reduction at 100 Hz. We further demonstrate the transfer of this atomic stability to a second laser, via the rubidium-disciplined cavity, and demonstrate multi-wavelength Rydberg electrometry quantum sensing. These results pave the path for integrated, compact, and scalable solutions for quantum sensing, computing and other atomic and trapped ion applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Electric Field and Zitterbewegung on a Photonic Frequency Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthetic frequency dimension, which realizes fictitious spatial dimensions from the spectral degree of freedom, has emerged as a promising platform for engineering artificial gauge fields in studying quantum simulations and topological physics with photons. A current central task for frequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial non-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating non-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a polarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering spin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and polarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic Floquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging self-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a trembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the frequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and Bloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian electric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge theory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and spinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain optical computation and multimodal frequency comb control.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures of proper time in optical ion clocks</title>

Abstract: Optical clocks based on atoms and ions probe relativistic effects with unprecedented sensitivity by resolving time dilation due to atom motion or different positions in the gravitational potential through frequency shifts. However, all measurements of time dilation so far can be explained effectively as the result of dynamics with respect to a classical proper time parameter. Here we show that atomic clocks can probe effects where a classical description of the proper time dynamics is insufficient. We apply a Hamiltonian formalism to derive time dilation effects in harmonically trapped clock atoms and show how second-order Doppler shifts (SODS) due to the vacuum energy (vSODS), squeezing (sqSODS) and quantum corrections to the dynamics (qSODS) arise. We also demonstrate that the entanglement between motion and clock evolution can become observable in state-of-the-art clocks when the motion of the atoms is strongly squeezed, realizing proper time interferometry. Our results show that experiments with trapped ion clocks are within reach to probe relativistic evolution of clocks for which a quantum description of proper time becomes necessary.</description>

      <title>Dichroic Electron Emission Patterns from Oriented Helium Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a joint experimental and theoretical study using a combination of polarization-controlled free-electron-laser (FEL) and near-infra\-red (NIR) pulses in a synchronized two-color photo\-ionization scheme. Excited He$^+$ ions, created by extreme ultraviolet (XUV) circularly polarized radiation from the XUV-FEL FERMI in the oriented $3p\, (m\!=\!+1)$ state, are exposed to circularly polarized 784-nm NIR radiation with peak intensities from $10^{12}\,\rm W/cm^2$ to $\rm 10^{13}\,W/cm^2$. The angular distribution of the ejected electrons exhibit a strong dichroism depending on the NIR intensity. While the co-rotating case is defined by a single path, for the counter-rotating case, there are two dominant pathways whose relative strength and phase difference are determined.</description>

      <title>QED calculations of the $2p$-$2s$ transition energies in Li-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic QED calculations of ionization energies of the $2s$, $2p_{1/2}$, and $2p_{3/2}$ states, as well as the $2p_{1/2}$--$2s$ and $2p_{3/2}$--$2p_{1/2}$ transition energies are performed for Li-like ions with the nuclear charge numbers $Z = 10$--$100$. The convergence of QED perturbative expansion is improved by using the extended Furry picture, which starts from the Dirac equation with a local screening potential. An ab initio treatment is accomplished for one- and two-photon electron-structure QED effects and the one-photon screening of the self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections. This is complemented with an approximate treatment of the two-photon QED screening and higher-order (three or more photon) electron-structure effects. As a result, the obtained theoretical predictions improve upon the accuracy achieved in previous calculations. Comparison with available experimental data shows a good agreement between theory and experiment. In most cases, the theoretical values surpass the experimental results in precision, with only a few exceptions. In the case of uranium and bismuth, the comparison provides one of the most stringent tests of bound-state QED in the strong-field regime. Alternatively, the obtained results can be employed for high-precision determinations of nuclear charge radii.</description>

      <title>Selective collective emission from a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a nanophotonic resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically study collective emission of a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a single mode in a nanophotonic microring resonator. Because many cold atoms are localized in a small volume, these trapped atoms collectively couple not only to the guided resonator mode but also to the nonguided modes in free space. Through tuning the atom-photon coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the microring resonator. For photon emission via the nonguided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady state and to the timed-Dicke state, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment. Our observation and methodology could shed light on future explorations of collective emission with densely packed quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic light-matter interfaces.</description>
