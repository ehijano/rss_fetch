      <title>Critical equations with a sharp change of sign in the nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence and nonexistence of entire solutions to a semilinear elliptic problem whose nonlinearity is the critical power multiplied by a function that takes the value 1 in an open bounded region and the value -1 in its complement. The existence or not of solutions depends on the geometry of the bounded region, in a way analogous to what happens with the classical critical Dirichlet problem in a bounded domain. Our methods are variational and include the use of topological tools.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric type II blowup solutions to the three dimensional Keller-Segel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct axisymmetric solutions to the three-dimensional parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system that blows up in finite time. In particular, the singularity is of type II, which admits locally a leading order profile of the rescaled stationary solution of the two-dimensional system. Additionally, mass concentration occurs along a one-dimensional ring in the plane. In the analysis, we rely on an approximate solution of the eigenproblem associated with the linearized operator around the stationary solution as well as the modulation dynamics to control the perturbation function and derive the accurate blowup rate.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for solutions to non-autonomous critical p-Laplace problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove optimal decay estimates for positive solutions to elliptic p-Laplacian problems in the entire Euclidean space, when a critical nonlinearity with a decaying source term is considered. Also gradient decay estimates are furnished. Our results extend previous theorems in the literature, in which a purely critical reaction is treated. The technique is based on a priori estimates, regularity results, and rescaling arguments, combined with the doubling lemma.</description>

      <title>Global strong solutions to a compressible fluid-particle interaction model with density-dependent friction force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a fluid-particle interaction model in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This model consists of the compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations and the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation coupled together via the density-dependent friction force. Due to the strong coupling caused by the friction force, it is a challenging problem to construct the global existence and optimal decay rates of strong solutions. In this paper, by assuming that the $H^2$-norm of the initial data is sufficiently small, we establish the global well-posedness of strong solutions. Furthermore, if the $L^1$-norm of initial data is bounded, then we achieve the optimal decay rates of strong solutions and their gradients in $L^2$-norm. The proofs rely on developing refined energy estimates and exploiting the frequency decomposition method. In addition, for the periodic domain case, our global strong solutions decay exponentially.</description>

      <title>Wave breaking for the nonlinear variational wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following conservative solutions of the nonlinear variational wave equation $u_{tt}-c(u)(c(u)u_x)_x=0$ along forward and backward characteristics, we identify criteria, which guarantee that wave breaking either occurs in the nearby future or occurred recently. Thereafter, we apply the established criteria to show that not every traveling wave solution is a conservative solution. Furthermore, we show that conservative solutions can locally behave like solutions to the linear wave equation and hence energy that concentrates on sets of measure zero might remain concentrated instead of spreading out immediately.</description>

      <title>Weak Harnack estimates for a doubly nonlinear nonlocal p-Laplace equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new type of weak Harnack estimates with optimal parabolic tail for the weak supersolutions to a doubly nonlinear nonlocal $p$-Laplace equation, which is modeled on the nonlocal Trudinger equation. Our results are achieved by employing the expansion of positivity and measure theoretical techniques. In particular, the weak Harnack estimates highlight the nonlocal feature, as we only require the local positivity of weak supersolutions instead of the global one.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a finite volume method for a 1-D wave equation with non smooth wave speed and localized Kelvin-Voigt damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the numerical solution of an elastic/viscoelastic wave equation with non smooth wave speed and internal localized distributed Kelvin-Voigt damping acting faraway from the boundary. Our method is based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and we are interested in deriving the stability estimates and the convergence of the numerical solution to the continuous one. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the theoretical study on the decay rate of the solution to the null one when a localized damping acts.</description>

      <title>Global existence of martingale solutions to stochastic keller-segel system with degenerate diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic degenerate Keller-Segel system perturbed by linear multiplicative noise in a bounded domain $\mathcal{O}$. We establish the global existence of martingale solutions for this model with any nonnegative initial data in $H_{2}^{-1}(\mathcal{O})$. The main challenge in proving the existence of solutions arises from the degeneracy of the porous media diffusion and the lack of coercivity in the nonlinear chemotactic term. To overcome these difficulties, we construct a solution operator and apply the Schauder fixed point theorem within the variational framework.</description>

      <title>Shock formation for the 2D rotating shallow water equations with non-zero vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the shock formation for the two-dimensional rotating shallow water system is established. We construct a large class of initial data which leads to the finite-time blow-up for the solutions. Moreover, the solutions are allowed to have non-zero large vorticity (in derivative sense), even up to the shock. Our results provide the first complete geometric description of the shock formation mechanism to the two-dimensional rotating shallow water system with vorticity. The formation of shock is characterized by the collapse of the characteristic hypersurfaces, where the first-order derivatives of the velocity, the height, and the specific vorticity blow up while the potential vorticity remains Lipschitz continuous. The methods developed in this paper should also be useful in studying the shock formation for the Euler equations with various source terms and a class of quasilinear Klein-Gordon equations in multi-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Integral representation of solutions to initial-boundary value problems in the framework of the hyperbolic heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider initial-boundary value problems on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and modified Fourier's law (constitutive equation, commonly called the Cattaneo equation) describing temperature (or internal energy) and heat flux. This hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations is the simplest model of non-Fourier heat conduction. Boundary conditions comprise various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of a unique global smooth solution to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and provide a concise proof. We establish a new global well-posedness result that allows the initial data to be arbitrarily large within the critical space $\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$, while still satisfying the nonlinear smallness condition.</description>

      <title>Weak-strong uniqueness for solutions to mean-field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the crucial question of solution uniqueness in stationary first-order Mean-Field Games (MFGs). Despite well-established existence results, establishing uniqueness, particularly for weaker solutions in the sense of monotone operators, remains an open challenge. Building upon the framework of monotonicity methods, we introduce a linearization method that enables us to prove a weak-strong uniqueness result for stationary MFG systems on the d-dimensional torus. In particular, we give explicit conditions under which this uniqueness holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter examines monotonicity techniques in the theory of mean-field games(MFGs). Originally, monotonicity ideas were used to establish the uniqueness of solutions for MFGs. Later, monotonicity methods and monotone operators were further exploited to build numerical methods and to construct weak solutions under mild assumptions. Here, after a brief discussion on the mean-field game formulation, we introduce the Minty method and regularization strategies for PDEs. These are then used to address typical stationary and time-dependent monotone MFGs and to establish the existence of weak solutions for such MFGs.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonal upper heat kernel bounds on graphs with unbounded geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results regarding off-diagonal Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds on discrete weighted graphs with possibly unbounded geometry are summarized and related.
  After reviewing uniform upper heat kernel bounds obtained by Carlen, Kusuoka, and Stroock, the universal Gaussian term on graphs found by Davies is addressed and related to corresponding results in terms of intrinsic metrics. Then we present a version of Grigor'yan's two-point method with Gaussian term involving an intrinsic metric. A discussion of upper heat kernel bounds for graph Laplacians with possibly unbounded but integrable weights on bounded combinatorial graphs preceeds the presentation of compatible bounds for anti-trees, an example of combinatorial graph with unbounded Laplacian. Characterizations of localized heat kernel bounds in terms of intrinsic metrics and universal Gaussian are reconsidered. Finally, the problem of optimality of the Gaussian term is discussed by relating Davies' optimal metric with the supremum over all intrinsic metrics.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann framework for polyatomic gases: review on well-posedness, higher integrability and physical relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews results on the scalar Boltzmann equation for a single-component polyatomic gas with continuous internal energy. For the space homogeneous problem, $L^1$-theory is established, for solutions with initial strictly positive mass and bounded energy, which enables to solve the Cauchy problem for initial data with $L^1_{2^+}$-moments using the comparison principle for ODEs. Then, deriving entropy-based estimates, $L^p$-integrability properties of the solution are explored, $p\in (1,\infty]$. All these analytical results hold under a specific assumption on the collision kernel corresponding to cut-off and hard-potentials type. A mean to verify physical applicability of the model is to evaluate the corresponding Boltzmann collision operator and to derive models for transport coefficients in terms of the collision kernel parameters. Comparison with experimental data for polytropic gases determines values of these parameters showing the physical relevance of the collision kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $U,H$ be two separable Hilbert spaces. The main goal of this paper is to study the weak uniqueness of the Stochastic Differential Equation evolving in $H$ \begin{align*} dX(t)=AX(t)dt+\mathcal{V}B(X(t))dt+GdW(t), \quad t&gt;0, \quad X(0)=x \in H, \end{align*} where $\{W(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a $U$-cylindrical Wiener process, $A:D(A)\subseteq H\to H$ is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup, $\mathcal{V},G:U\rightarrow H$ are linear bounded operators and $B:H\rightarrow U$ is a uniformly continuous function. The abstract result in this paper gives the weak uniqueness for large classes of heat and damped equations in any dimension without any H\"older continuity assumption on $B$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I will demonstrate the effectiveness of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) when training data are scarce or noisy. The training data can be located either at the boundaries or within the domain. Additionally, PINNs can be used as an inverse method to determine unknown coefficients in the equations. This study will highlight the application of PINNs in modeling magnetohydrodynamic processes relevant to strongly magnetized plasmas, such as those found in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>First order operators on shrinking graph-like spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the convergence of first order operators on a thickened graph (a graph-like space) towards a similar operator on the underlying metric graph. On the graph-like space, the first order operator is of the form exterior derivative (the gradient) on functions and its adjoint (the negative divergence) on closed 1-forms (irrotational vector fields). Under the assumption that each cross section of the tubular edge neighbourhood is convex, that each vertex neighbourhood is simply connected and under suitable uniformity assumptions (which hold in particular, if the spaces are compact) we establish generalised norm resolvent convergence of the first order operator on the graph-like space towards the one on the metric graph. The square of the first order operator is of Laplace type; on the metric graph, the function (0-form) component is the usual standard (Kirchhoff) Laplacian. A key ingredient in the proof is a uniform Gaffney estimate: such an estimate follows from an equality relating here the divergence operator with all (weak) partial derivatives and a curvature term, together with a (localised) Sobolev trace estimate.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation with spin-torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current-induced magnetisation dynamics in a ferromagnet at elevated temperatures can be described by the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation with spin-torque terms. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the global strong solution to the model in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$, with an additional smallness assumption on the initial data if $d=3$. We then propose a fully discrete linearly implicit finite element scheme for the problem and prove that it approximates the solution with an optimal order of convergence, provided the exact solution possesses adequate regularity. Furthermore, we propose an unconditionally energy-stable finite element method to approximate the LLB equation without spin current. This scheme also converges to the exact solution at an optimal order, and is shown to be energy-dissipative at the discrete level. Finally, some numerical simulations to complement the theoretical analysis are included.</description>

      <title>Discrete Superconvergence Analysis for Quantum Magnus Algorithms of Unbounded Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by various applications, unbounded Hamiltonian simulation has recently garnered great attention. Quantum Magnus algorithms, designed to achieve commutator scaling for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation, have been found to be particularly efficient for such applications. When applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, they exhibit an unexpected superconvergence phenomenon. However, existing proofs are limited to the spatially continuous setting and do not extend to discrete spatial discretizations. In this work, we provide the first superconvergence estimate in the fully discrete setting with a finite number of spatial discretization points $N$, and show that it holds with an error constant uniform in $N$. The proof is based on the two-parameter symbol class, which, to our knowledge, is applied for the first time in algorithm analysis. The key idea is to establish a semiclassical framework by identifying two parameters through the discretization number and the time step size rescaled by the operator norm, such that the semiclassical uniformity guarantees the uniformity of both. This approach may have broader applications in numerical analysis beyond the specific context of this work.</description>

      <title>Scalable Signature Kernel Computations for Long Time Series via Local Neumann Series Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The signature kernel is a recent state-of-the-art tool for analyzing high-dimensional sequential data, valued for its theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU. These advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications that involve very long and highly volatile data.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability for Sobolev and log-Sobolev inequalities, with optimal dimensional dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08651v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sharp quantitative version for the stability of the Sobolev inequality with explicit constants. Moreover, the constants have the correct behavior in the limit of large dimensions, which allows us to deduce an optimal quantitative stability estimate for the Gaussian log-Sobolev inequality with an explicit dimension-free constant. Our proofs rely on several ingredients such as competing symmetries, a flow based on continuous Steiner symmetrization that interpolates continuously between a function and its symmetric decreasing rearrangement, and refined estimates on the Sobolev functional in the neighborhood of the optimal Aubin--Talenti functions.</description>

      <title>Sharp Lp-Lq estimates for evolution equations with damped oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive sharp $L^p-L^q$ estimates, $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$ (including endpoint estimates as $L^1-L^1$ and $L^1-L^\infty$) for dissipative wave-type equations, under the assumption that the dissipation dampen the oscillations but it does not cancel them. We assume that the phase function $w$ is homogeneous of some degree $\sigma&gt;0$ and that its Hessian matrix has maximal rank, including the critical case $\sigma=1$, while the dissipative term $a(\xi)&gt;0$ may be inhomogeneous. The critical case includes waves with viscoelastic or structural damping, damped double dispersion equations and plate equations with rotational inertia, and so on. We also obtain the analogous results for fractional Schr\"odinger-type equations with a potential.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we investigate a doubly nonlinear diffusion equation in the slow diffusion regime. We prove stability of the pressure of solutions that are close to traveling wave solutions in a homogeneous Lipschitz sense. We derive regularity estimates for arbitrary derivatives of the solution's pressure by extending existing results for the porous medium equation (Ref. 15).</description>

      <title>On variable Lebesgue spaces and generalized nonlinear heat equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work  we address some questions concerning  the Cauchy problem for a generalized nonlinear heat equations considering as functional framework the variable Lebesgue spaces  $L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. More precisely, by mixing some structural properties of these spaces with decay estimates of the fractional heat kernel, we were able to prove two well-posedness results for these equations.  In a first theorem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global-in-time  mild solutions in the mixed-space $\mathcal{L}^{p(\cdot)}_{   \frac{nb}{2\alpha - \langle 1 \rangle_\gamma}  } (\mathbb{R}^n,L^\infty([0,T[ ))$. On the other hand,  by introducing a new class of variable exponents, we demonstrate the existence of an unique local-in-time mild solution  in the space $L^{p(\cdot)} \left( [0,T], L^{q} (\mathbb{R}^3) \right)$.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality holds on an open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if the strict $p$-capacitary inradius of $\Omega$ is finite. To that end, new upper and lower bounds for the infimum for the associated nonlinear Rayleigh quotients are derived.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow for a class of diffusion equations with Dirichlet boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a variational characterisation for a class of non-linear evolution equations with constant non-negative Dirichlet boundary conditions on a bounded domain as gradient flows in the space of non-negative measures. The relevant geometry is given by the modified Wasserstein distance introduced by Figalli and Gigli that allows for a change of mass by letting the boundary act as a reservoir. We give a dynamic formulation of this distance as an action minimisation problem for curves of non-negative measures satisfying a continuity equation in the spirit of Benamou-Brenier. Then we characterise solutions to non-linear diffusion equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions as metric gradient flows of internal energy functionals in the sense of curves of maximal slope.</description>

      <title>Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds and Faber-Krahn inequalities on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the equivalence of relative Faber-Krahn inequalities and the conjunction of Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds and volume doubling on large scales on graphs. For the normalizing measure, we obtain their equivalence up to constants by imposing comparability of small balls and the vertex degree at their centers. Removing this comparability assumption on the cost of a local regularity condition entering the equivalence and allowing for a variable dimension lead to a further generalization. The variable dimension converges to the doubling dimension for increasing ball radius. If the counting measure or arbitrary measures are considered, the local regularity condition contains the vertex degree. Furthermore, correction functions for the Gaussian, doubling, and Faber-Krahn dimension depending on the vertex degree are introduced. For the Gaussian and doubling, the variable correction functions always tend to one at infinity. Moreover, the variable Faber-Krahn dimension can be related to the doubling dimension and the vertex degree growth.</description>

Abstract: We establish an explicit uniform a priori estimate for weak solutions to slightly subcritical elliptic problems with nonlinearities simultaneously at the interior and on the boundary. Our explicit $L^{\infty}(\Omega )$ a priori estimates are in terms of powers of their $H^{1}(\Omega )$ norms. To prove our result, we combine a De Giorgi-Nash-Moser's iteration scheme together with elliptic regularity and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg's interpolation inequality.</description>

Abstract: We study a finite-horizon differential game of pursuit-evasion like, between a single player and a mass of agents. The player and the mass directly control their own evolution, which for the mass is given by a first order PDE of transport equation type. Using also an adapted concept of non-anticipating strategies, we derive an infinite dimensional Isaacs equation, and by dynamic programming techniques we prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution on a suitable invariant subset of a Hilbert space.</description>
