      <title>Towards single-shot coherent imaging via overlap-free ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychographic imaging at synchrotron and XFEL sources requires dense overlapping scans, limiting throughput and increasing dose. Extending coherent diffractive imaging to overlap-free operation on extended samples remains an open problem. Here, we extend PtychoPINN (O. Hoidn \emph{et al.}, \emph{Scientific Reports} \textbf{13}, 22789, 2023) to deliver \emph{overlap-free, single-shot} reconstructions in a Fresnel coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) geometry while also accelerating conventional multi-shot ptychography. The framework couples a differentiable forward model of coherent scattering with a Poisson photon-counting likelihood; real-space overlap enters as a tunable parameter via coordinate-based grouping rather than a hard requirement. On synthetic benchmarks, reconstructions remain accurate at low counts ($\sim\!10^4$ photons/frame), and overlap-free single-shot reconstruction with an experimental probe reaches amplitude structural similarity (SSIM) 0.904, compared with 0.968 for overlap-constrained reconstruction. Against a data-saturated supervised model with the same backbone (16,384 training images), PtychoPINN achieves higher SSIM with only 1,024 images and generalizes to unseen illumination profiles. Per-graphics processing unit (GPU) throughput is approximately $40\times$ that of least-squares maximum-likelihood (LSQ-ML) reconstruction at matched $128\times128$ resolution. These results, validated on experimental data from the Advanced Photon Source and the Linac Coherent Light Source, unify single-exposure Fresnel CDI and overlapped ptychography within one framework, supporting dose-efficient, high-throughput imaging at modern light sources.</description>

      <title>Fiber Link Stabilization with a Multicore Fiber Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the use of separate cores of a multicore erbium-doped fiber amplifier (MC-EDFA) in a noise-canceled link for ultrastable optical frequency transfer. We demonstrate fractional frequency instability of $5\times10^{-19}$ at 1000 s averaging time for the stabilized MC-EDFA alone and $1.4\times10^{-18}$ at 1000 s averaging time when integrated with a 40 km-long 7-core spooled fiber. This study further establishes multicore fiber (MCF) networks as a promising platform for ultrastable frequency transfer, serving as an important step toward incorporating precision time and frequency distribution into future MCF communication infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Coupling nitrogen vacancy centers in silicon carbide to nanophotonic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising platform for scalable quantum technologies owing to its well-established, wafer-scale industrial processing. SiC also hosts a variety of optically active color centres including the nitrogen vacancy defect that has a spin-triplet ground state. However, strong phonon coupling in the infrared range limits photon extraction from these defects. Here, we use nanophotonic structures, specifically micro-pillar and micro-disk resonators, to enhance optical collection and spin-readout. The micro-pillar geometry yields a 4-fold increase in photon collection, accompanied by a 2.4-fold reduction in spectral noise in optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. Consequently, the magnetic field sensitivity is improved by 24%. The large mode volume of the micro-disk supports resonances spanning 1150-1250 nm, enabling broadband coupling to nitrogen vacancy emission lines. Our results demonstrate that fabrication of scalable photonic structures efficiently improves performance of silicon carbide color centers for integrated quantum light generation and sensing.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal electrooptic intermodal scattering with momentum engineered RF waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal modulation approaches have been often employed as alternatives for producing optical non-reciprocity without magneto-optic materials. Unidirectional inter-modal scattering, enabled by either acousto-optic or electro-optic (EO) modulation, is a promising method in this category as it can directly modify optical dispersions and even enables linear non-reciprocal photonic devices in the strong coupling limit. While EO approaches are often preferred for their practicality, it is challenging to generate the large spatiotemporal momentum required for inter-modal phase matching without EO drive schemes involving multiple drive stimuli. Here, we demonstrate highly selective non-reciprocal inter-modal EO scattering enabled by a single high-index radiofrequency (RF) traveling wave stimulus. Our experimental demonstration is performed on a thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonics platform, in which we engineer a slow-wave radiofrequency (SWRF) transmission line with an effective RF index &gt; 9 that natively generates the required RF momentum while simultaneously maintaining strong RF-optical mode overlap. By additionally engineering the interaction length, we achieve a directional ~20 dB non-reciprocal scattering contrast. The SWRF architecture provides a scalable route to magnetic-free non-reciprocity and establishes momentum-engineered RF waves as a powerful tool for next-generation, fully integrated non-reciprocal photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Pure-amplitude holograms for high-efficiency generation of phase radial grating based radial carpet beams: Theory and experiments under plane-wave and Gaussian illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a pure-amplitude hologram (PAH) for generating radial carpet beams (RCBs), which are conventionally produced using pure phase radial gratings (PRGs). The hologram is designed by embedding the transmission function of a binary PRG into the phase argument of the cosine term(s) of an amplitude linear grating. When illuminated with a plane wave, this hologram generates RCBs in the non-zero diffraction orders, and when illuminated with a Gaussian beam, it generates RCB-like patterns at specific propagation distances. This method entirely eliminates the need for complex and expensive spatial light modulators (SLMs). The study presents a theory of diffraction for plane and Gaussian beams from such holograms, including a specific theoretical treatment of Gaussian beam diffraction from PRGs. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we demonstrate how different RCBs can be generated at different diffraction orders due to the phase-amplitude enhancement resulting from multiplying the diffraction order number by the phase amplitude of the embedded base PRG, when the illuminating beam is a plane wave. For the Gaussian beam case, we show how different RCB-like patterns can be generated at different diffraction orders for the same reason, though only at specific propagation distances. Experimental and numerical results indicate that this technique yields RCBs and RCB-like patterns with approximately five times the useful power of their SLM-generated counterparts, demonstrating significantly higher power efficiency. This advantage renders the proposed method highly suitable for applications such as multiple optical trapping and free-space optical communication.</description>

      <title>Trap-dependent current suppression of optically excited III-V nanowires at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of quantum technology networks necessitates high-speed, low-thermal load, and minimal-noise communication links between cryogenic and room-temperature components. At the heart of modern telecommunication, lay optical interconnects allowing for large data transfer capabilities via optical fibers. However, cryogenic photonic technologies remain largely unexplored and require a detailed understanding of material behavior and defect dynamics at low temperatures. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of integrated III-V heterostructures operating at cryogenic temperatures down to 5K. Using an integrated n-InP/i-InGaAs/p-InP/p-InGaAs stack monolithically grown on silicon, we identify a temperature-dependent current-lowering mechanism arising from trap states becoming increasingly active below 140K. We demonstrate for the first time that these traps can be equivalently excited and controlled through either thermal or optical energy, revealing a dual modulation mechanism. These findings provide new insights into carrier transport and defect behavior in III-V heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures, advancing the field of cryogenic photonics and offering a non-destructive approach for identifying and characterizing material impurities in integrated quantum and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Towards Polarization Routing of Magnetic and Electric Dipolar Emission with Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization properties of emission associated with the magnetic dipole and electric dipole transitions of europium(III) coupled to an anisotropic dielectric metasurface with polarization-engineered electric and magnetic photonic local density of states. The metasurface consists of a square array of Mie-resonant elliptical a-Si:H dimers situated on an SiO$_2$ substrate and embedded in a PMMA film containing Eu(TTA)$_3$. Based on reciprocity principle, it was designed to achieve maximum electric (magnetic) field enhancement in the dimer gap at 610 nm (590 nm) for $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) normally incident light in order to selectively enhance the electric dipole (magnetic dipole) emission into the $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) emission channel, respectively. Momentum-resolved spectroscopy and back-focal plane imaging of emission of the fabricated light-emitting metasurface clearly reveal the intended polarization-dependent emission behaviour, with the $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) emission showing a reduced (enhanced) ratio of the magnetic-/electric dipole emission intensity, correspondingly where the magnetic dipole emission is enhanced with a magnetic field enhancement from the nanostructures. The demonstrated polarization-dependent interaction of a designed nanostructure with the electric- and magnetic dipolar transitions of trivalent lanthanide ions opens an avenue towards routing of emission of different multipolar orders into different polarization channels.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature, continuous wave lasing in planar microcavities with quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality planar cavities with low-absorption mirrors based on $Al_{0.2}Ga_{0.8}As/Al_{0.9}Ga_{0.1}As$ layers demonstrate continuous wave lasing at a wavelength of 957 nm. At 300 K, the threshold power density and quality-factor at threshold are (11.4$\pm$0.7) $kW/cm^2$ and (5070$\pm$160). Increasing the pumping level above two thresholds results in an enlargement in the quality-factor to at least 19000. Efficient lateral heat dissipation in the planar semiconductor microcavity is confirmed by a low mode-energy shift, which is 660 $\mu$eV at two lasing thresholds.</description>

      <title>From raw data to processed spectra: A step-by-step guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy is an important and widely used technique, for instance, to characterize new materials and to identify unknown compounds. Spectra are typically reported as a function of the wavelength of light, yet the information extracted from such spectra can be misleading. In contrast, spectra represented as a function of the frequency (or photon energy) allow for a more direct extraction of the intrinsic quantum-mechanical properties of the materials under investigation. Here we discuss this conversion for absorption, fluorescence and fluorescence excitation spectra. We show step-by-step the different factors that lead to a rescaling of the measured absorption and fluorescence signals. This paper will assist instructors who aim at developing an (under-)graduate lab to introduce into the methodology and terminology of spectroscopic experiments and to provide clear, step-by-step guidelines for data analysis and representation.</description>

      <title>Chains of nanoparticles for flat-band emission and lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling light-matter interactions is central to photonic technologies ranging from lasers to optical information processing. Suitably designed photonic structures give rise to flat (dispersionless) bands, where the density of states diverges, and group velocity goes to zero, allowing light localization. These properties make flat bands attractive for lasing; however, designing photonic structures supporting flat bands suitable for lasing is challenging. Here, we introduce nanoparticle chain lattices. These chain geometries provide long-range coupled systems that support, at predictable wavelengths, bands that are totally flat and extend over the full angular range. We demonstrate lasing in the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode of single chains of nanoparticles and explain the transition from flat band lasing to the single-mode normal-incidence (Gamma-point) lasing as the number of chains is increased. Moreover, we show partially coherent emission from square and triangular two-dimensional chain lattices. The excited modes depend on the pump power and polarization. Our results establish chain lattices as a versatile platform for exploring flat band lasing and suggest new routes toward narrowband, linearly polarized, and bright light sources with tailored coherence.</description>

      <title>Flat Bands from Diffraction in Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic photonic structures enable precise control over the light-matter interaction through band structure engineering. Certain lattice geometries exhibit dispersionless flat bands, characterized by vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states, which present unique opportunities for applications such as slow light, nonlinear optical processes and controlling photoluminescence. However, thus far, flat bands have not been reported in systems where the lattice sites are radiatively coupled over a long range. Here we show that lattices consisting of superposed equispaced one dimensional chains exhibit flat bands with a purely diffractive origin, with the energies and angles of the flat bands controlled by the geometrical parameters of the lattice and the unit cell. The flat bands extend over all angles, can have linewidths on the order of a few nanometers, and are linearly polarized. We experimentally observe flat bands at predicted energies in lattices of gold nanoparticles at near-infrared frequencies using Fourier spectroscopy. Our results provide a general and efficient design strategy for lattices with flat, polarized dispersions for applications such as flat-band lasing, enhancing light-matter interaction, and controlling the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation over a wide spectral range.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enabled Invisible Electromagnetic Scattering Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of micro-electro-mechanical systems, electrically small micro-targets, such as subwavelength micro unmanned aerial vehicles and bionic mosquito robots, exhibit ultra-low scattering cross section, which brings severe challenges to their effective detection. To address this problem, an Invisible Electromagnetic Scattering Amplifier (IESA) is designed by combining finite-element electromagnetic simulation with a forward lossless tandem neural network. The IESA realizes the dual-functional integration of intrinsic electromagnetic invisibility (near-zero scattering) for itself and significant scattering amplification for subwavelength targets entering its air sensing region. Electromagnetic simulations verify that the designed IESA can achieve a stable scattering amplification effect on subwavelength targets with a characteristic size of approximately 0.1{\lambda}0, regardless of their spatial positions or geometric shapes, with a maximum scattering cross section amplification factor of 8.58. The IESA breaks the technical bottleneck of the separate design of electromagnetic invisibility and scattering amplification functions. It shows potential for applications in the fields of radar detection, anti-terrorism security, micro-target monitoring, and adaptive electromagnetic sensing.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Broken Cavity Solitons and Collective Polarization Conformity in Fabry-Perot Kerr Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental generation of polarization symmetry-broken cavity solitons (CSs) in a passive, fiber-based, coherently-driven, Fabry-Perot (FP) Kerr resonator. Polarization resolved measurements reveal the spontaneous transition of initially symmetric CSs into asymmetrical vectorial states, triggered by a cross-phase modulation-induced polarization bifurcation. Most notably, due to counter-propagation of light occurring in FP resonators, we unveil a collective polarization conformity effect, whereby multiple CSs circulating in the cavity converge to the same asymmetric polarization state once their number exceeds a certain threshold. These results demonstrate that Fabry-Perot resonators support novel collective soliton dynamics that are absent in ring architectures.</description>

      <title>Polarization Dynamics in VCSELs Under Sinusoidal Signal Modulation around the Polarization Switching point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) combine compact geometry, low threshold current, and ease of integration, making them central to modern photonic systems. However, their polarization behavior remains a critical factor affecting performance, as the emission state can switch between orthogonally polarized modes around the so-called polarization switching point. This regime exhibits high sensitivity, where small perturbations induce abrupt polarization changes and nonlinear responses. In this work, the polarization dynamics of VCSELs under sinusoidal current modulation around the switching point are numerically investigated using the Spin-Flip Model. The study examines the influence of modulation frequency, amplitude, and bias current, revealing distinct dynamical regimes including polarization locking, periodic and irregular switching. The observed transitions between regimes elucidate the interplay between modulation and polarization stability, providing insight into the control of VCSEL dynamics for high-speed optical communication and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Geometric representation of higher-order optical modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An octant representation of higher-order optical modes that includes Laguerre-Gaussian and Hermite-Gaussian modes is presented. The octant picture captures the high-dimensional nature of three-state optical systems and beyond, with standard Poincar\'e spheres for orbital angular momentum forming subspaces of the entire state space. This representation enables intuitive manipulation of both classical modes and optical qudits and provides a framework for extending Berry phases and topological invariants to high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Chirped Pulse Analysis and Control in Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems using Complex Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and experimentally establish a connection between linearly chirped pulse propagation properties and complex time delay for both transmitted and reflected pulses in reverberant scattering systems. We demonstrate that the time shift of the chirped pulse depends on both the real and imaginary parts of the complex time delay of the scattering system. We also show that the chirped pulse experiences a center frequency shift that is directly proportional to the imaginary component of complex time delay, similar to that found in Giovannelli and Anlage (2025). Using these insights, we then demonstrate how complex time delay can be harnessed to systematically tune the propagation properties of a chirped pulse such that a near-zero time shift can be achieved for a wide range of pulse center frequencies in a resonant scattering system.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond-scale discrete wavelength switching in feedback-controlled single-gain-section multi-wavelength lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate discrete wavelength switching in single-gain-section multi-wavelength lasers monolithically integrated on InP with phase-controlled optical-feedback. By modulating the feedback phase, nanosecond-scale wavelength switching is experimentally demonstrated with transition times below 2.5 ns. Measurements consistently show that the switching time decreases with stronger optical feedback and larger phase-modulation amplitudes. Transitions from lower to higher modal gain are faster. We support the experimental observations with a multi-mode extension of the Lang-Kobayashi rate-equation model. We analyze the influence of laser, feedback-cavity, and modulation parameters on the switching dynamics, and highlight the role of mode coupling. These results highlight the potential of integrated multi-wavelength lasers for compact and high-speed all-optical networking systems.</description>

      <title>Through-bottle spectroscopy as a tool for quality control and anti-counterfeiting of Brandy and Cognac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfeiting of premium spirits poses significant economic and health risks, that could be tackled by robust, accurate, portable and non-destructive through-bottle measurements. Here, we demonstrate the capability of focus-matched inverse spatially offset spectroscopy, combining fluorescence and Raman signals, for authenticating Cognac and Brandy. The technique accurately identifies age classification, bottling year, spoilage due to elevated storage temperatures, and distinguishes between Cognac brands. Critically, our method effectively differentiates genuine Cognacs from counterfeit products, correctly identifying 98% of counterfeit samples. This shows the promise of through-bottle spectroscopy as a powerful tool for supply chain integrity and consumer protection in the high-value spirits market.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced Bright and Dark Exciton Emission from Perovskite Quantum Dots in Micro-ring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) integrated with waveguide-coupled dielectric resonators are promising building blocks for compact on-chip light sources. However, deterministic placement of QDs with strong mode overlap at the desired location remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and scalable strategy for integrating colloidal QDs with a waveguide-coupled Si3N4 micro-ring resonator platform and for controlling the radiative dynamics of both bright and dark excitons via Purcell enhancement. We use strongly quantum-confined CsPbBr3 QDs, which exhibit bright-exciton emission at room-temperature, while emission at cryogenic temperatures originates from both bright and dark excitons. The CsPbBr3 QDs are selectively retained on the Si3N4 micro-ring cavities through a spin-coating/rinsing process, enabling efficient overlap with whispering-gallery modes and routing of the emission through integrated waveguides. We confirm accelerated decay of emission from both bright and dark excitons for CsPbBr3 QDs coupled to the micro-ring cavities. These results demonstrate an effective route to integrate colloidal QDs with Si3N4 micro-ring cavities and to leverage cavity-enhanced emission in scalable integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Violating Wormhole Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study massless spin-1 field propagation in a static, circularly symmetric $(2+1)$-dimensional wormhole with spatial Lorentz-violating anisotropy characterized by the throat radius $a$ and deformation parameter $\eta$. The geometry is horizon-free, geodesically complete, and asymptotically flat, with negative Gaussian curvature localized near the throat. Using the fully covariant vector boson formalism and covariant Maxwell theory, we derive an exact Schr\"odinger-type radial equation with a curvature-induced effective potential. Recasting the dynamics in Helmholtz form yields an effective refractive-index profile, showing that the wormhole acts as an inhomogeneous optical medium with position-dependent refractive index and frequency-dependent confinement, where low-frequency modes are strongly trapped while high-frequency modes propagate almost freely. A differential-geometric correspondence with helicoidal surfaces is established via $1/[a^2(1-\eta)] \leftrightarrow w^2$, demonstrating that Lorentz-violation-induced curvature is mathematically equivalent to curvature generated by geometric twist and linking the model to twisted graphene nanoribbons as analog-gravity platforms. These results provide a geometric framework for curvature-driven localization, dispersion, and anisotropic wave propagation in topologically nontrivial $(2+1)$-dimensional backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Tuning Wave-Particle Duality of Quantum Light by Generalized Photon Subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave--particle duality is a hallmark of quantum mechanics. For bosonic systems, there exists a continuum of intermediate states bridging wave-like Schr\"odinger cat states and particle-like Fock states. Such states have recently been recognized as valuable resources for enhancing fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) with propagating light. Here we experimentally demonstrate tunable generation of these intermediate states by employing generalized photon subtraction (GPS). By detecting up to three photons from squeezed-light sources with a photon-number-resolving detector, we continuously control the balance between wave- and particle-like features. This approach allows us to construct a spectral family of quantum states with high generation rates, optimized according to the required fault-tolerance threshold. Our results establish GPS as a versatile toolbox for tailoring non-Gaussian resources, opening a pathway to efficient Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) qubit generation and addressing a central bottleneck in optical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in open cavity optomechanics and Liouvillian versus Hamiltonian exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.</description>

      <title>Realistic Threat Models for Fiber and Free-Space Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</description>
