      <title>Quantitative comparison of TDDFT-calculated HHG yields in ring-shaped organic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the high-harmonic-generation (HHG) yield driven by a mid-infrared laser in three organic ring-shaped molecules, calculated using time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT). We average the yield over the relative orientation of the molecules and the linearly-polarized, 1825 nm driving laser pulse in order to compare to experimental spectra obtained by Alharbi et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 041801 (2015). We find that the raw TDDFT-calculated HHG yield in cyclohexane (CHA) is strongly overestimated compared to those of benzene and cyclohexene, and that this can be attributed to unphysically large contributions from CHA orbitals lying well below the highest-occupied molecular orbital. We show that implementing a simple orbital-resolved scaling factor, which corrects the yield of the tunneling ionization contribution to the first step in the HHG process, leads to much better comparisons with experimental results. Our results are encouraging for the use of TDDFT in systematic computations of HHG in large molecules.</description>

      <title>Temperature sensitivity of a Thorium-229 solid-state nuclear clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the low energy thorium-229 nuclear transition was recently achieved. The five allowed transitions within the electric quadrupole splitting structure were measured to the kilohertz level in a calcium fluoride host crystal, opening the field of nuclear-based optical clocks. Central to the performance of solid-state clock operation is an understanding of systematic shifts such as the temperature dependence of the clock transitions. In this work, we measure the four strongest transitions of thorium-229 in the same crystal at three temperature values: 150 K, 229 K, and 293 K. We find shifts of the unsplit frequency and the electric quadrupole splittings, corresponding to decreases in the electron density, electric field gradient, and field gradient asymmetry at the nucleus as temperature increases. The $\textit{m}$ = $\pm 5/2 \rightarrow \pm 3/2$ line shifts only 62(6) kHz over the temperature range, i.e., approximately 0.4 kHz/K, representing a promising candidate for a future solid-state optical clock. Achieving 10$^{-18}$ precision requires crystal temperature stability of 5$\mu$K.</description>

      <title>Photoionization of atoms and ions from endohedral anions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interconnection between the results of two qualitatively different approximate calculations of photoionization cross sections, $\sigma_{n\ell}$, for neutral atoms ($A$) or their cations ($A^+$), centrally confined inside a fullerene-anion shell, $C_{N}^{q}$ , where $q$ represents the negative excess charge on the shell. One of the approximations, frequently employed in previous studies, assumes a uniform excess negative charge distribution over the entire fullerene shell, by analogy with a charged metallic sphere. The other approximation, not previously discussed in the literature, considers the quantum states of the excess electrons on the shell, determined by specific $n$ and $\ell$ values of their quantum numbers. Remarkably, both methods yield photoionization cross sections for the encapsulated species that are close to each other. Consequently, we find that the photoionization of the encapsulated atoms or cations inside a $C_{N}^{q}$ anion is minimally influenced by the quantum states of the excess electrons on the fullerene shell. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the aforementioned influence decreases even further with an increasing size of the confining fullerene shell. All this holds true at least under the assumption that the confined atom or cation is compact, i.e., its electron density remains primarily within itself rather than being drawn into the fullerene shell. This remarkable finding results from Hartree-Fock calculations combined with a popular modeling of the fullerene shell, where it is modeled by an attractive spherical annular potential.</description>

      <title>Electric field control for experiments with atoms in Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atoms excited to Rydberg states have recently emerged as a valuable resource in neutral atom platforms for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum information processing. Atoms in Rydberg states have large polarizabilities, making them highly sensitive to electric fields. Therefore, stray electric fields can decohere these atoms, in addition to compromising the fidelity of engineered interactions between them. It is therefore essential to cancel these stray electric fields. Here we present a novel, simple, and highly-compact electrode assembly, implemented in a glass cell-based vacuum chamber design, for stray electric field cancellation. The electrode assembly allows for full 3D control of the electric field in the vicinity of the atoms while blocking almost no optical access. We experimentally demonstrate the cancellation of stray electric fields to better than 10 mV/cm using this electrode assembly.</description>

      <title>Doppler-free selective reflection spectroscopy of electric-quadrupole transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric-dipole-forbidden transitions play an important role as in quantum sensing, quantum information, and fundamental test in physics. As such, the development of novel and sensitive spectroscopic methods is of major interest. Here, we present a Doppler-free selective reflection experiment on the 6S1/2 --&gt; 5D5/2 electric-quadrupole transition of cesium vapor at the vicinity of a sapphire window. This is achieved by a precision experiment overcoming limitations due to the small signal amplitude of forbidden transitions. Narrow sub-Doppler lines allow for a collisional broadening measurement on the electric-quadrupole line. The interaction of cesium atoms with the sapphire surface of the cell is evidenced, but, due to its weak contribution, a quantitative analysis remains challenging. Nevertheless, our experiment paves the way for further studies of the Casimir-Polder interaction between exotic excited-state atoms and dielectric surfaces.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole coupling of circular Rydberg qubits to inner shell excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Divalent atoms provide excellent means for advancing control in Rydberg atom-based quantum simulation and computing, due to the second optically active valence electron available. Particularly promising in this context are circular Rydberg atoms, for which long-lived ionic core excitations can be exploited without suffering from detrimental autoionization. Here, we report the implementation of electric quadrupole coupling between the metastable 4D$_{3/2}$ level and a very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular Rydberg qubit, realized in doubly excited $^{88}$Sr atoms prepared from an optical tweezer array. We measure the kHz-scale differential level shift on the circular Rydberg qubit via beat-node Ramsey interferometry comprising spin echo. Observing this coupling requires coherent interrogation of the Rydberg states for more than one hundred microseconds, which is assisted by tweezer trapping and circular state lifetime enhancement in a black-body radiation suppressing capacitor. Further, we find no noticeable loss of qubit coherence under continuous photon scattering on the ion core, paving the way for laser cooling and imaging of Rydberg atoms. Our results demonstrate access to weak electron-electron interactions in Rydberg atoms and expand the quantum simulation toolbox for optical control of highly excited circular state qubits via ionic core manipulation.</description>

      <title>Interaction of vector light beams with atoms exposed to a time-dependent magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During recent years interest has been rising for applications of vector light beams towards magnetic field sensing. In particular, a series of experiments were performed to extract information about properties of static magnetic fields from absorption profiles of light passing through an atomic gas target. In the present work, we propose an extension to this method for oscillating magnetic fields. To investigate this scenario, we carried out theoretical analysis based on the time-dependent density matrix theory. We found that absorption profiles, even when averaged over typical observation times, are indeed sensitive to both strength and frequency of the time-dependent field, thus opening the prospect for a powerful diagnostic technique. To illustrate this sensitivity, we performed detailed calculations for the $5s \;\, {}^2S_{1/2}$ ($F=1$) $-$ $5p \;\, {}^2 P_{3/2}$ ($F=0$) transition in rubidium atoms, subject to a superposition of an oscillating (test) and a static (reference) magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of electric dipole and quadrupole transitions in $^{224}$Ra$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on spectroscopy of the low-lying electronic transitions in $^{224}$Ra$^+$. The ion's low charge to mass ratio and convenient wavelengths make $^{224}$Ra$^+$ a promising optical clock candidate. We measured the frequencies of the the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{1/2}$ cooling transition, the $^2{S}_{1/2}\ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{D}_{5/2}$ clock transition, the $^2{D}_{3/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ electric dipole transition, and the $^2{D}_{5/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ cleanout transition. From these measurements we calculate the frequencies of the $^2{D}_{3/2}\ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{1/2}$ repump transition, the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{D}_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition, and the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ electric dipole transition.</description>

      <title>The Jaynes-Cummings model and its descendants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.00330v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model has been at the forefront of quantum optics for almost six decades to date, providing one of the simplest yet intricately nonlinear formulations of light-matter interaction in modern physics. Laying most of the emphasis on the omnipresence of the model across a range of disciplines, this monograph brings up the fundamental generality of its formalism, looking at a wide gamut of applications in specific physical systems among several realms, including atomic physics, quantum optics, solid-state physics and quantum information science. When bringing the various pieces together to assemble our narrative, we have primarily targeted researchers in quantum physics and quantum optics. The monograph also comprises an accessible introduction for graduate students engaged with non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, quantum computing and simulation, and quantum many-body physics. In that framework, we aim to reveal the common ground between physics and applications scattered across literature and different technological advancements. The exposition guides the reader through a vibrant field interlacing quantum optics and condensed-matter physics. All sections are devoted to the strong interconnection between theory and experiment, historically linked to the development of the various modern research directions stemming from JC physics. This is accompanied by a comprehensive list of references to the key publications that have shaped its evolution since the early 1960s. Finally, we have endeavored to keep the presentation of such a multi-sided material as concise as possible, interspersing continuous text with various illustrations alongside an economical use of mathematical expressions.</description>

      <title>On the Onset of Coherent Phonon Motion in Peierls-Distorted Antimony by Attosecond Transient Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.</description>

      <title>Bosenovae with Quadratically-Coupled Scalars in Quantum Sensing Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) particles of mass $m_\phi \lesssim 1~{\rm eV}$ can form boson stars in DM halos. Collapse of boson stars leads to explosive bosenova emission of copious relativistic ULDM particles. In this work, we analyze sensitivity of terrestrial and space-based experiments to detect such relativistic scalar ULDM particles interacting through quadratic couplings with Standard Model constituents, including electrons, photons and gluons. We highlight key differences with searches for linear ULDM couplings. Screening of ULDM with quadratic couplings near the surface of the Earth can significantly impact observations in terrestrial experiments, motivating future space-based experiments. We demonstrate excellent ULDM discovery prospects, especially for quantum sensors, which can probe quadratic couplings orders below existing constraints by detecting bosenova events in the ULDM mass range $10^{-23}\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-5}\,{\rm eV}$. We also report updated constraints on quadratic couplings of ULDM in case it comprises cold DM.</description>
