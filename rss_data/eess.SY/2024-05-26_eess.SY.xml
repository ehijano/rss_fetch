      <title>On Robust Controlled Invariants for Continuous-time Monotone Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the problem of computing robust controlled invariants for monotone continuous-time systems, with a specific focus on lower-closed specifications. We consider the classes of state monotone (SM) and control-state monotone (CSM) systems, we provide the structural properties of robust controlled invariants for these classes of systems and show how these classes significantly impact the computation of invariants. Additionally, we introduce a notion of feasible points, demonstrating that their existence is sufficient to characterize robust controlled invariants for the considered class of systems. The study further investigates the necessity of reducing the feasibility condition for CSM and Lipschitz systems, unveiling conditions that guide this reduction. Leveraging these insights, we construct an algorithm for the computation of robust controlled invariants. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we applied the developed algorithm to the coupled tank problem.</description>

      <title>Black Start Operation of Grid-Forming Converters Based on Generalized Three-phase Droop Control Under Unbalanced Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the challenging task of bottom-up restoration in a complete blackout system using Grid-forming (GFM) converters. Challenges arise due to the limited current capability of power converters, resulting in distinct dynamic responses and fault current characteristics compared to synchronous generators. Additionally, GFM control needs to address the presence of unbalanced conditions commonly found in distribution systems. To address these challenges, this paper explores the black start capability of GFM converters with a generalized three-phase GFM droop control. This approach integrates GFM controls individually for each phase, incorporating phase-balancing feedback and enabling current limiting for each phase during unbalanced faults or overloading. The introduction of a phase-balancing gain provides flexibility to trade-off between voltage and power imbalances. The study further investigates bottom-up black start operations using GFM converters, incorporating advanced load relays into breakers for gradual load energization without central coordination. The effectiveness of bottom-up black start operations with GFM converters, utilizing the generalized three-phase GFM droop, is evaluated through electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. The results confirm the performance and effectiveness of this approach in achieving successful black start operations under unbalanced conditions.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of nonlinear stochastic flexibility function in smart energy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand-side management provides a great potential for improving the efficiency and reliability of energy systems. This requires a mechanism to connect the market level and the demand side. The flexibility function is a novel approach that bridges the gap between the markets and the dynamics of physical assets at the lower levels of the energy systems and activates demand-side flexibility with the purpose of decision-making as well as for offering a new framework for balancing and grid services. Employing this function as a key for many decision-making and control algorithms reveals that a mathematically rigorous stability analysis is required for it. In this paper, we investigate the stability properties of two nonlinear flexibility functions, as a dynamic mapping between electricity price and power consumption. Specifically, we analyze the stability of a deterministic flexibility function and an It\^{o} stochastic flexibility function. Simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the dynamics of the flexibility functions and to show that the analytical results hold.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Gated Recurrent Units for Iterative Online Precise Attitude Control for Geodetic Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of precise attitude control for geodetic missions, such as the GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-FO) mission. Traditional and well-established control methods, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers, have been the standard in attitude control for most space missions, including the GRACE-FO mission. Instead of significantly modifying (or replacing) the original PID controllers that are being used for these missions, we introduce an iterative modification to the PID controller that ensures improved attitude control precision (i.e., reduction in attitude error). The proposed modification leverages Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to learn and predict external disturbance trends derived from incoming attitude measurements from the GRACE satellites. Our analysis has revealed a distinct trend in the external disturbance time-series data, suggesting the potential utility of GRU's to predict future disturbances acting on the system. The learned GRU model compensates for these disturbances within the standard PID control loop in real time via an additive correction term which is updated at regular time intervals. The simulation results verify the significant reduction in attitude error, verifying the efficacy of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Control of Disturbed Interconnected Systems with High-Order Tuners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of network synchronization under limited communication, involving heterogeneous agents with different dynamics and various network topologies, to achieve consensus. We investigate the distributed adaptive control for interconnected unknown linear subsystems with a leader and followers, in the presence of input-output disturbance. We enhance the communication within multi-agent systems to achieve consensus under the leadership's guidance. While the measured variable is similar among the followers, the incoming measurements are weighted and constructed based on their proximity to the leader. We also explore the convergence rates across various balanced topologies (Star-like, Cyclic-like, Path, Random), featuring different numbers of agents, using three distributed algorithms, ranging from first- to high-order tuners to effectively address time-varying regressors. The mathematical foundation is rigorously presented from the network designs of the unknown agents following a leader, to the distributed methods. Moreover, we conduct several numerical simulations across various networks, agents and tuners to evaluate the effects of sparsity in the interaction between subsystems using the $L_2-$norm and $L_\infty-$norm. Some networks exhibit a trend where an increasing number of agents results in smaller errors, although this is not universally the case. Additionally, patterns observed at initial times may not reliably predict overall performance across different networks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed modified high-order tuner outperforms its counterparts, and we provide related insights along with our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Economic Dispatch with Flexible Loads and RES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain the supply-demand balance of power systems by solely relying on the generation side. To combat the volatility led by the uncertain RESs, demand-side management by leveraging the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) has been recognized as an economic and efficient approach. Thus, it is important to integrate MDF into existing power systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced day-ahead energy market, where the MDFs of aggregate loads are traded to minimize the generation cost and mitigate the volatility of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the transmission network. We first explicitly capture the negative impact of the uncertainty from RESs on the day-ahead market by a chance-constrained economic dispatch problem (CEDP). Then, we propose a bidding mechanism for the MDF of the aggregate loads and combine this mechanism into the CEDP for the day-ahead market. Through multiple case studies, we show that MDF from load aggregators can reduce the volatility of LMPs. In addition, we identify the values of the different flexibilities in the MDF bids, which provide useful insights into the design of more complex MDF markets.</description>

      <title>Robust Economic Dispatch with Flexible Demand and Adjustable Uncertainty Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With more renewable energy sources (RES) integrated into the power system, the intermittency of RES places a heavy burden on the system. The uncertainty of RES is traditionally handled by controllable generators to balance the real time wind power deviation. As the demand side management develops, the flexibility of aggregate loads can be leveraged to mitigate the negative impact of the wind power. In view of this, we study the problem of how to exploit the multi-dimensional flexibility of elastic loads to balance the trade-off between a low generation cost and a low system risk related to the wind curtailment and the power deficiency. These risks are captured by the conditional value-at-risk. Also, unlike most of the existing studies, the uncertainty set of the wind power output in our model is not fixed. By contrast, it is undetermined and co-optimized based on the available load flexibility. We transform the original optimization problem into a convex one using surrogate affine approximation such that it can be solved efficiently. In case studies, we apply our model on a six-bus transmission network and demonstrate that how flexible load aggregators can help to determine the optimal admissible region for the wind power deviations.</description>

      <title>Seamless Integration and Implementation of Distributed Contact and Contactless Vital Sign Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time vital sign monitoring is gaining immense significance not only in the medical field but also in personal health management. Facing the needs of different application scenarios of the smart and healthy city in the future, the low-cost, large-scale, scalable, and distributed vital sign monitoring system is of great significance. In this work, a seamlessly integrated contact and contactless vital sign monitoring system, which can simultaneously implement respiration and heartbeat monitoring, is proposed. In contact vital sign monitoring, the chest wall movement due to respiration and heartbeat is translated into changes in the optical output intensity of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The FBG is also an important part of radar signal generation for contactless vital sign monitoring, in which the chest wall movement is translated into phase changes of the radar de-chirped signal. By analyzing the intensity of the FBG output and phase of the radar de-chirped signal, real-time respiration and heartbeat monitoring are realized. In addition, due to the distributed structure of the system and its good integration with the wavelength-division multiplexing optical network, it can be massively scaled by employing more wavelengths. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out. Contact and contactless respiration and heartbeat monitoring of three people are simultaneously realized. During a monitoring time of 60 s, the maximum absolute measurement errors of respiration and heartbeat rates are 1.6 respirations per minute and 2.3 beats per minute, respectively. The measurement error does not have an obvious change even when the monitoring time is decreased to 5 s.</description>

      <title>An input-output continuous-time version of Willems' lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate a novel version of Willems' lemma for data-based representation of continuous-time systems. The main novelties compared to previous works are two. First, the proposed framework relies only on measured input-output trajectories from the system and no internal (state) information is required. Second, our system representation makes use of exact system trajectories, without resorting to orthogonal bases representations and consequent approximations. We first establish sufficient and necessary conditions for data-based generation of system trajectories in terms of suitable latent variables. Subsequently, we reformulate these conditions using measured input-output data and show how to span the full behavior of the system. Furthermore, we show how to use the developed framework to solve the data-based continuous-time simulation problem.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of DC-DC Buck Converter based on Deep Neural Network Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to address the challenge of traditional sliding mode controllers struggling to balance between suppressing system jitter and accelerating convergence speed, a deep neural network (DNN)-based sliding mode control strategy is proposed in this paper. The strategy achieves dynamic adjustment of parameters by modelling and learning the system through deep neural networks, which suppresses the system jitter while ensuring the convergence speed of the system. To demonstrate the stability of the system, a Lyapunov function is designed to prove the stability of the mathematical model of the DNN-based sliding mode control strategy for DC-DC buck switching power supply. We adopt a double closed-loop control mode to combine the sliding mode control of the voltage inner loop with the PI control of the current outer loop. Simultaneously, The DNN performance is evaluated through simulation and hardware experiments and compared with conventional control methods. The results demonstrate that the sliding mode controller based on the DNN exhibits faster system convergence speed, enhanced jitter suppression capability, and greater robustness.</description>

      <title>Integrated Design for Wave Energy Converter Farms: Assessing Plant, Control, Layout, and Site Selection Coupling in the Presence of Irregular Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising direction towards reducing the levelized cost of energy for wave energy converter (WEC) farms is to improve their performance. WEC design studies generally focus on a single design domain (e.g., geometry, control, or layout) to improve the farm's performance under simplifying assumptions, such as regular waves. This strategy, however, has resulted in design recommendations that are impractical or limited in scope because WEC farms are complex systems that exhibit strong coupling among geometry, control, and layout domains. In addition, the location of the candidate site, which has a large impact on the performance of the farm, is often overlooked. Motivated by some of the limitations observed in WEC literature, this study uses an integrated design framework, based on simultaneous control co-design (CCD) principles, to discuss the impact of site selection and wave type on WEC farm design. Interactions among plant, control, and layout are also investigated and discussed using a wide range of simulations and optimization studies. All of the studies were conducted using frequency-domain heaving cylinder WEC devices within a farm with a linear reactive controller in the presence of irregular probabilistic waves. The results provide high-level guidelines to help the WEC design community move toward an integrated design perspective.</description>

      <title>Social Zone as a Barrier Function for Socially-Compliant Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of integrating social norms into robot navigation, which is essential for ensuring that robots operate safely and efficiently in human-centric environments. Social norms, often unspoken and implicitly understood among people, are difficult to explicitly define and implement in robotic systems. To overcome this, we derive these norms from real human trajectory data, utilizing the comprehensive ATC dataset to identify the minimum social zones humans and robots must respect. These zones are integrated into the robot' navigation system by applying barrier functions, ensuring the robot consistently remains within the designated safety set. Simulation results demonstrate that our system effectively mimics human-like navigation strategies, such as passing on the right side and adjusting speed or pausing in constrained spaces. The proposed framework is versatile, easily comprehensible, and tunable, demonstrating the potential to advance the development of robots designed to navigate effectively in human-centric environments.</description>

      <title>Provably Quantum-Secure Microgrids through Enhanced Quantum Distributed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed control of multi-inverter microgrids has attracted considerable attention as it can achieve the combined goals of flexible plug-and-play architecture guaranteeing frequency and voltage regulation while preserving power sharing among nonidentical distributed energy resources (DERs). However, it turns out that cybersecurity has emerged as a serious concern in distributed control schemes. Inspired by quantum communication developments and their security advantages, this paper devises a scalable quantum distributed controller that can guarantee synchronization, and power sharing among DERs. The key innovation lies in the fact that the new quantum distributed scheme allows for exchanging secret information directly through quantum channels among the participating DERs, making microgrids inherently cybersecure. Case studies on two ac and dc microgrids verify the efficacy of the new quantum distributed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Linearly Controlled Language Generation with Performative Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Large Language Models (LMs) in critical applications highlights the need for controlled language generation strategies that are not only computationally efficient but that also enjoy performance guarantees. To achieve this, we use a common model of concept semantics as linearly represented in an LM's latent space. In particular, we take the view that natural language generation traces a trajectory in this continuous semantic space, realized by the language model's hidden activations. This view permits a control-theoretic treatment of text generation in latent space, in which we propose a lightweight, gradient-free intervention that dynamically steers trajectories away from regions corresponding to undesired meanings. Crucially, we show that this intervention, which we compute in closed form, is guaranteed (in probability) to steer the output into the allowed region. Finally, we demonstrate on a toxicity avoidance objective that the intervention steers language away from undesired content while maintaining text quality.</description>

      <title>Sums: Sniffing Unknown Multiband Signals under Low Sampling Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to sophisticated deployments of all kinds of wireless networks (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LEO satellite, etc.), multiband signals distribute in a large bandwidth (e.g., from 70 MHz to 8 GHz). Consequently, for network monitoring and spectrum sharing applications, a sniffer for extracting physical layer information, such as structure of packet, with low sampling rate (especially, sub-Nyquist sampling) can significantly improve their cost- and energy-efficiency. However, to achieve a multiband signals sniffer is really a challenge. To this end, we propose Sums, a system that can sniff and analyze multiband signals in a blind manner. Our Sums takes advantage of hardware and algorithm co-design, multi-coset sub-Nyquist sampling hardware, and a multi-task deep learning framework. The hardware component breaks the Nyquist rule to sample GHz bandwidth, but only pays for a 50 MSPS sampling rate. Our multi-task learning framework directly tackles the sampling data to perform spectrum sensing, physical layer protocol recognition, and demodulation for deep inspection from multiband signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sums achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-theart baselines in spectrum sensing, modulation classification, and demodulation. As a result, our Sums can help researchers and end-users to diagnose or troubleshoot their problems of wireless infrastructures deployments in practice.</description>

Abstract: Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</description>

      <title>Sliding-Mode Nash Equilibrium Seeking for a Quadratic Duopoly Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method to achieve stable convergence to Nash equilibrium in duopoly noncooperative games. Inspired by the recent fixed-time Nash Equilibrium seeking (NES) as well as prescribed-time extremum seeking (ES) and source seeking schemes, our approach employs a distributed sliding mode control (SMC) scheme, integrating extremum seeking with sinusoidal perturbation signals to estimate the pseudogradients of quadratic payoff functions. Notably, this is the first attempt to address noncooperative games without relying on models, combining classical extremum seeking with relay components instead of proportional control laws. We prove finite-time convergence of the closed-loop average system to Nash equilibrium using stability analysis techniques such as time-scaling, Lyapunov's direct method, and averaging theory for discontinuous systems. Additionally, we quantify the size of residual sets around the Nash equilibrium and validate our theoretical results through simulations.</description>

      <title>Direct Data-Driven State-Feedback Control of Linear Parameter-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems has shown to be a powerful tool for the design of controllers for complex nonlinear systems using linear tools. In this work, we derive novel methods that allow to synthesize LPV state-feedback controllers directly from a single sequence of data and guarantee stability and performance of the closed-loop system, without knowing the model of the plant. We show that if the measured open-loop data from the system satisfies a persistency of excitation condition, then the full open-loop and closed-loop input-scheduling-state behavior can be represented using only the data. With this representation, we formulate synthesis problems that yield controllers that guarantee stability and performance in terms of infinite horizon quadratic cost, generalized $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm and $\ell_2$-gain of the closed-loop system. The controllers are synthesized by solving an SDP with a finite set of LMI constraints. Additionally, we provide a synthesis method to handle noisy measurement data. Competitive performance of the proposed data-driven synthesis methods is demonstrated w.r.t. model-based synthesis that have complete knowledge of the true system model in multiple simulation studies, including a nonlinear unbalanced disc system.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Battery Swapping Services for Freight Trucks with Spatial-Temporal Demand Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrifying heavy-duty trucks offers a substantial opportunity to curtail carbon emissions, advancing toward a carbon-neutral future. However, the inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.</description>

      <title>Social and Economic Impact Analysis of Solar Mini-Grids in Rural Africa: A Cohort Study from Kenya and Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the social and economic effects of solar mini-grids in rural African settings, specifically in Kenya and Nigeria. A group of 2,658 household heads and business owners connected to mini-grids over the last five years were interviewed both before and one year after their connection. These interviews focused on changes in gender equality, productivity, health, safety, and economic activity. The results show notable improvements in all areas. Economic activities and productivity increased significantly among the connected households and businesses. The median income of rural Kenyan community members quadrupled. Gender equality also improved, with women gaining more opportunities in decision making and business. Health and safety enhancements were linked to reduced use of hazardous energy sources like kerosene lamps. The introduction of solar mini-grids not only transformed the energy landscape but also led to broad socioeconomic benefits in these rural areas. The research highlights the substantial impact of decentralized renewable energy on the social and economic development of rural African communities. Its findings are crucial for policymakers, development agencies, and stakeholders focused on promoting sustainable energy and development in Africa.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of memory sampling in status updating systems, where source updates are published in shared memory, and reader process samples the memory for source updates by paying a sampling cost. We formulate a discrete-time decision problem to find a sampling policy that minimizes average cost comprising age at the client and the cost incurred due to sampling. We establish that an optimal policy is a stationary and deterministic threshold-type policy, and subsequently derive optimal threshold and the corresponding optimal average cost.</description>

      <title>On the constrained feedback linearization control based on the MILP representation of a ReLU-ANN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the efficacy of rectified linear unit artificial neural networks in addressing the intricate challenges of convoluted constraints arising from feedback linearization mapping. Our approach involves a comprehensive procedure, encompassing the approximation of constraints through a regression process. Subsequently, we transform these constraints into an equivalent representation of mixed-integer linear constraints, seamlessly integrating them into other stabilizing control architectures. The advantage resides in the compatibility with the linear control design and the constraint satisfaction in the model predictive control setup, even for forecasted trajectories. Simulations are provided to validate the proposed constraint reformulation.</description>

      <title>Slow Inter-area Electro-mechanical Oscillations Revisited: Structural Property of Complex Multi-area Electric Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a physically-intuitive notion of inter-area dynamics in systems comprising multiple interconnected energy conversion modules. The idea builds on an earlier general approach of setting their structural properties by modeling internal dynamics in stand-alone modules (components, areas) using the fundamental conservation laws between energy stored and generated, and then constraining explicitly their Tellegen's quantities (power and rate of change of power). In this paper we derive, by following the same principles, a transformed state-space model for a general nonlinear system. Using this model we show the existence of an area-level interaction variable, intVar, whose rate of change depends solely on the area internal power imbalance and is independent of the model complexity used for representing individual module dynamics in the area. Given these structural properties of stand-alone modules, we define in this paper for the first time an inter-area variable as the difference of power wave incident to tie-line from Area I and the power reflected into tie-lie from Area II. Notably, these power waves represent the interaction variables associated with the two respective interconnected areas. We illustrate these notions using a linearized case of two lossless inter-connected areas, and show the existence of a new inter-area mode when the areas get connected. We suggest that lessons learned in this paper open possibilities for computationally-efficient modeling and control of inter-area oscillations, and offer further the basis for modeling and control of dynamics in changing systems comprising faster energy conversion processes.</description>

      <title>PDE Control Gym: A Benchmark for Data-Driven Boundary Control of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, data-driven methods have surged in popularity, emerging as valuable tools for control theory. As such, neural network approximations of control feedback laws, system dynamics, and even Lyapunov functions have attracted growing attention. With the ascent of learning based control, the need for accurate, fast, and easy-to-use benchmarks has increased. In this work, we present the first learning-based environment for boundary control of PDEs. In our benchmark, we introduce three foundational PDE problems - a 1D transport PDE, a 1D reaction-diffusion PDE, and a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE - whose solvers are bundled in an user-friendly reinforcement learning gym. With this gym, we then present the first set of model-free, reinforcement learning algorithms for solving this series of benchmark problems, achieving stability, although at a higher cost compared to model-based PDE backstepping. With the set of benchmark environments and detailed examples, this work significantly lowers the barrier to entry for learning-based PDE control - a topic largely unexplored by the data-driven control community. The entire benchmark is available on Github along with detailed documentation and the presented reinforcement learning models are open sourced.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamical Systems by Leveraging Data from Similar Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the dynamics of a linear system when one has access to data generated by an auxiliary system that shares similar (but not identical) dynamics, in addition to data from the true system. We use a weighted least squares approach, and provide finite sample error bounds of the learned model as a function of the number of samples and various system parameters from the two systems as well as the weight assigned to the auxiliary data. We show that the auxiliary data can help to reduce the intrinsic system identification error due to noise, at the price of adding a portion of error that is due to the differences between the two system models. We further provide a data-dependent bound that is computable when some prior knowledge about the systems, such as upper bounds on noise levels and model difference, is available. This bound can also be used to determine the weight that should be assigned to the auxiliary data during the model training stage.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Imitation Learning from Visual Observations using Latent Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on the problem of imitation learning from visual observations, where the learning agent has access to videos of experts as its sole learning source. The challenges of this framework include the absence of expert actions and the partial observability of the environment, as the ground-truth states can only be inferred from pixels. To tackle this problem, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of imitation learning in partially observable environments. We establish upper bounds on the suboptimality of the learning agent with respect to the divergence between the expert and the agent latent state-transition distributions. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce an algorithm called Latent Adversarial Imitation from Observations, which combines off-policy adversarial imitation techniques with a learned latent representation of the agent's state from sequences of observations. In experiments on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks, we show that our model-free approach in latent space matches state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we show how our method can be used to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning from pixels by leveraging expert videos. To ensure reproducibility, we provide free access to our code.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling-based Online Learning for Episodic POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning in POMDPs is known to be significantly harder than MDPs. In this paper, we consider the online learning problem for episodic POMDPs with unknown transition and observation models. We propose a Posterior Sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm for POMDPs (PS4POMDPs), which is much simpler and more implementable compared to state-of-the-art optimism-based online learning algorithms for POMDPs. We show that the Bayesian regret of the proposed algorithm scales as the square root of the number of episodes, matching the lower bound, and is polynomial in the other parameters. In a general setting, its regret scales exponentially in the horizon length $H$, and we show that this is inevitable by providing a lower bound. However, when the POMDP is undercomplete and weakly revealing (a common assumption in the recent literature), we establish a polynomial Bayesian regret bound. We finally propose a posterior sampling algorithm for multi-agent POMDPs, and show it too has sublinear regret.</description>

      <title>Airship Formations for Animal Motion Capture and Behavior Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using UAVs for wildlife observation and motion capture offers manifold advantages for studying animals in the wild, especially grazing herds in open terrain. The aerial perspective allows observation at a scale and depth that is not possible on the ground, offering new insights into group behavior. However, the very nature of wildlife field-studies puts traditional fixed wing and multi-copter systems to their limits: limited flight time, noise and safety aspects affect their efficacy, where lighter than air systems can remain on station for many hours. Nevertheless, airships are challenging from a ground handling perspective as well as from a control point of view, being voluminous and highly affected by wind. In this work, we showcase a system designed to use airship formations to track, follow, and visually record wild horses from multiple angles, including airship design, simulation, control, on board computer vision, autonomous operation and practical aspects of field experiments.</description>
