      <title>Landau type theorem for $\alpha$-harmonic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first obtain an estimate of the coefficients for $\alpha$-harmonic mappings. The Landau type theorem for $\alpha$-harmonic mappings defined on the unit disc $\ID$ of the complex plane is then obtained by applying these estimates.</description>

      <title>Values distribution of holomorphic curves on annuli into projective varieties with hypersurface targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper has twofold. The first is to establish a Cartan-Nochka theorem for holomorphic curves from annuli into projective varieties intersecting hypersurfaces in subgeneral position with truncated counting functions. The second is to give a second main theorem for such curves with arbitrary families of hypersurfaces, where the truncation level of the counting functions is explicitly estimated not depending on the number of hypersurfaces. As an application, we give a uniqueness theorem for such curves sharing a few hypersurfaces in a projective variety ignoring multiplicity. Our results generalize and improve the recent previous results in this topic.</description>

      <title>Entropy density and large deviation principles without upper semi-continuity of entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding Thurston maps were introduced by M. Bonk and D. Meyer with motivation from complex dynamics and Cannon's conjecture from geometric group theory via Sullivan's dictionary. In this paper, we show that the entropy map of an expanding Thurston map is upper semi-continuous if and only if the map has no periodic critical points. For all expanding Thurston maps, even in the presence of periodic critical points, we show that ergodic measures are entropy-dense and establish level-2 large deviation principles for the distribution of Birkhoff averages, periodic points, and iterated preimages. It follows that iterated preimages and periodic points are equidistributed with respect to the unique equilibrium state for an expanding Thurston map and a potential that is H\"older continuous with respect to a visual metric on $S^2$. In particular, our results answer two questions in [Li15].
  The main technical tools in this paper are called subsystems of expanding Thurston maps, inspired by a translation of the notion of subgroups via Sullivan's dictionary.</description>

Abstract: We show that a compact K\"ahler manifold bimeromorphic to a weakly K\"ahler hyperbolic manifold is weakly K\"ahler hyperbolic, providing an answer to a problem raised by J. Koll\'ar in his 1995 book "Shafarevic maps and automorphic forms"</description>

      <title>Concavity property of minimal $L^{2}$ integrals with Lebesgue measurable gain II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a concavity property of the minimal $L^{2}$ integrals related to multiplier ideal sheaves with Lebesgue measurable gain on weakly pseudoconvex K\"ahler manifolds. As applications, we give a necessary condition for the concavity degenerating to linearity, and a characterization for the holding of the equality in optimal jets $L^2$ extension problem on open Riemann surfaces.</description>
