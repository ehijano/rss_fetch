      <title>Morita equivalence problem for symplectic reflection algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we fully solve the Morita equivalence problem for symplectic reflection algebras associated to direct products of finite subgroups of $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$. Namely, given a pair of such symplectic reflection algebras $H_c, H_{c'}$,then $H_c$ is Morita equivalent to $H_c'$ if and only if they are related by a standard Morita equivalence. We also establish new cases for Morita classification problem for type A rational Cherednik algebras. Our approach crucially relies on the reduction modulo large primes.</description>

      <title>Smooth representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth modules for affine Kac-Moody algebras have a prime importance for the quantum field theory as they correspond to the representations of the universal affine vertex algebras. But, very little is known about such modules beyond the category of positive energy representations. We construct a new class of smooth modules over affine Kac-Moody algebras. In a particular case, these modules are isomorphic to those induced from generalized Whittaker modules for Takiff Lie algebras. We establish the irreducibility criterion for constructed modules in the case of the affine sl(2) Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Dirac cohomology, branching laws and Wallach modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of using Dirac cohomology to study branching laws was initiated by Huang, Pandzi\'c and Zhu in 2013 [HPZ]. One of their results says that the Dirac cohomology of $\pi$ completely determines $\pi|_{K}$, where $\pi$ is any irreducible unitarizable highest weight $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$ module. This paper aims to develop this idea for the exceptional Lie groups $E_{6(-14)}$ and $E_{7(-25)}$: we recover the $K$-spectrum of the Wallach modules from their Dirac cohomology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decomposition of tensor powers of two dimensional irreducible representations of quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at even roots of unity into direct sums of tilting modules. We derive a combinatorial formula for multiplicity of tilting modules in the $N$-th tensor power of two dimensional irreducible representations, interpret it in terms of lattice paths and find its asymptotic behavior when $N\to\infty$. We also describe the limit of character and Plancherel measures when $N\to\infty$. We consider both $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with divided powers and the small quantum $sl_2$.</description>

      <title>On the lattice model of the Weil representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let F be a local field. In the case of F being the real field, Pierre Cartier constructed Heisenberg-Weil representations of a Heisenberg group in families using non-self-dual lattices. This result was later reformulated by Jae-Hyun Yang in another paper. We extend this family of representations to a representation of a Jacobi subgroup by incorporating a rational Metaplectic group. In the case of F being a non-archimedean local field of odd residual characteristic or a finite unramified extension of the field of 2-adic numbers, we obtain similar results for a Jacobi group by incorporating a Metaplectic group.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the conjectures of Capparelli, Meurman, Primc and Primc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a sequence of two papers, S. Capparelli, A. Meurman, A. Primc, M. Primc (CMPP) and then M. Primc put forth three remarkable sets of conjectures, stating that the generating functions of coloured integer partition in which the parts satisfy restrictions on the multiplicities admit simple infinite product forms. While CMPP related one set of conjectures to the principally specialised characters of standard modules for the affine Lie algebra $\mathrm{C}_n^{(1)}$, finding a Lie-algebraic interpretation for the remaining two sets remained an open problem. In this paper, we use the work of Griffin, Ono and the fourth author on Rogers-Ramanujan identities for affine Lie algebras to solve this problem, relating the remaining two sets of conjectures to non-standard specialisations of standard modules for $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{n+1}^{(2)}$. We also use their work to formulate conjectures for the bivariate generating function of one-parameter families of CMPP partitions in terms of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions. We make a detailed study of several further aspects of CMPP partitions, obtaining (i) functional equations for bivariate generating functions which generalise the well-known Rogers-Selberg equations, (ii) a partial level-rank duality in the $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ case, and (iii) (conjectural) identities of the Rogers-Ramanujan type for $\mathrm{D}_3^{(2)}$.</description>

      <title>Feigin-Odesskii brackets associated with Kodaira cycles and positroid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a link between open positroid varieties in the Grassmannians $G(k,n)$ and certain moduli spaces of complexes of vector bundles over Kodaira cycle $C^n$, using the shifted Poisson structure on the latter moduli spaces and relating them to the standard Poisson structure on $G(k,n)$. This link allows us to solve a classification problem for extensions of vector bundles over $C^n$. Based on this solution we further classify the symplectic leaves of all positroid varieties in $G(k,n)$ with respect to the standard Poisson structure. Moreover, we get an explicit description of the moduli stack of symplectic leaves of $G(k,n)$ with the standard Poisson structure as an open substack of the stack of vector bundles on $C^n$.</description>

      <title>Even-carry polynomials and cohomology of line bundles on the incidence correspondence in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the cohomology groups of line bundles $\mathcal{L}$ on the \emph{incidence correspondence}, that is, a general hypersurface $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ of degrees $(1,1)$. Whereas the characteristic $0$ situation is completely understood, the cohomology in characteristic $p$ depends in a mysterious way on the base-$p$ digits of the degrees $(d, e)$ of $\mathcal{L}$. Gao and Raicu (following Linyuan Liu) prove a recursive description of the cohomology for $n = 3$, which relates to Nim polynomials when $p = 2$. In this paper, we devise a suitable generalization of Nim polynomials, which we call \emph{even-carry polynomials,} by which we can solve the recurrence of Liu--Gao--Raicu to yield an explicit formula for the cohomology for $n = 3$ and general $p$. We also make some conjectures on the general form of the cohomology for general $n$ and $p$.</description>

      <title>Periodic trivial extension algebras and fractionally Calabi-Yau algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study periodicity and twisted periodicity of the trivial extension algebra $T(A)$ of a finite-dimensional algebra $A$. Our main results show that (twisted) periodicity of $T(A)$ is equivalent to $A$ being (twisted) fractionally Calabi-Yau of finite global dimension. We also extend this result to a large class of self-injective orbit algebras. As a significant consequence, these results give a partial answer to the periodicity conjecture of Erdmann-Skowro\'nski, which expects the classes of periodic and twisted periodic algebras to coincide. On the practical side, it allows us to construct a large number of new examples of periodic algebras and fractionally Calabi-Yau algebras. We also establish a connection between periodicity and cluster tilting theory, by showing that twisted periodicity of $T(A)$ is equivalent the $d$-representation-finiteness of the $r$-fold trivial extension algebra $T_r(A)$ for some $r,d\ge 1$. This answers a question by Darp\"o and Iyama.
  As applications of our results, we give answers to some other open questions. We construct periodic symmetric algebras of wild representation type with arbitrary large minimal period, answering a question by Skowro\'nski. We also show that the class of twisted fractionally Calabi-Yau algebras is closed under derived equivalence, answering a question by Herschend and Iyama.</description>

      <title>On the intersection of local Arthur packets for classical groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups, we develop an account of theory on the intersection problem of local Arthur packets. Specifically, following Atobe's reformulation on M{\oe}glin's construction of local Arthur packets, we give a complete set of operators on the construction data, based on which, we provide algorithms and Sage codes to determine whether a given representation is of Arthur type. Furthermore, for any representation $\pi$ of Arthur type, we give a precise formula for the set $$ \Psi(\pi)=\{ \text{local Arthur parameter }\psi \ | \ \text{the local Arthur packet } \Pi_{\psi} \text{ contains } \pi\}.$$
  Our results have many applications, including the precise counting of tempered representations in any local Arthur packet, specifying and characterizing "the" local Arthur parameter in $\Psi(\pi)$ for $\pi$, especially when $\pi$ belongs to several local Arthur packets but does not belong to any local $L$-packet of Arthur type.</description>

      <title>The closure ordering conjecture on local Arthur packets of classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the closure ordering conjecture on the local $L$-parameters of representations in local Arthur packets of $\mathrm{G}_n=\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}, \mathrm{SO}_{2n+1}$ over a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero. Precisely, given any representation $\pi$ in a local Arthur packet $\Pi_{\psi}$, the closure of the local $L$-parameter of $\pi$ in the Vogan variety must contain the local $L$-parameter corresponding to $\psi$. This conjecture reveals a geometric nature of local Arthur packets and is inspired by the work of Adams, Barbasch, and Vogan, and the work of Cunningham, Fiori, Moussaoui, Mracek, and Xu, on ABV-packets. As an application, for general quasi-split connected reductive groups, we show that the closure ordering conjecture implies the enhanced Shahidi conjecture, under certain reasonable assumptions. This provides a framework towards the enhanced Shahidi conjecture in general. We verify these assumptions for $\mathrm{G}_n$, hence give a new proof of the enhanced Shahidi conjecture. At last, we show that local Arthur packets cannot be fully contained in other ones, which is in contrast to the situation over Archimedean local fields and has its own interests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the upper bound of wavefront sets of irreducible admissible representations of connected reductive groups defined over non-Archimedean local fields of characteristic zero. We formulate a new conjecture on the upper bound and show that it can be reduced to that of anti-discrete series representations, namely, those whose Aubert-Zelevinsky duals are discrete series. Then, we show that this conjecture is equivalent to the Jiang conjecture on the upper bound of wavefront sets of representations in local Arthur packets and also equivalent to an analogous conjecture on the upper bound of wavefront sets of representations in local ABV packets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diaconis and Gamburd computed moments of secular coefficients in the CUE ensemble. We use the characteristic map to give a new combinatorial proof of their result. We also extend their computation to moments of traces of symmetric powers, where the same result holds but in a wider range.
  Our combinatorial proof is inspired by gcd matrices, as used by Vaughan and Wooley and by Granville and Soundararajan. We use these CUE computations to suggest a conjecture about moments of characters sums twisted by the Liouville (or by the M\"obius) function, and establish a version of it in function fields.
  The moral of our conjecture (and its verification in function fields) is that the Steinhaus random multiplicative function is a good model for the Liouville (or for the M\"obius) function twisted by a random Dirichlet character.
  We also evaluate moments of secular coefficients and traces of symmetric powers, without any condition on the size of the matrix. As an application we give a new formula for a matrix integral that was considered by Keating, Rodgers, Roditty-Gershon and Rudnick in their study of the $k$-fold divisor function.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Gross-Prasad conjecture and its refinement for the Bessel periods in the case of $\left(\mathrm{SO}\left(5\right),\mathrm{SO}\left(2\right)\right)$. In particular, by combining several theta correspondences, we prove the Ichino-Ikeda type formula for any tempered irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations. As a corollary of our formula, we prove an explicit formula relating certain weighted averages of Fourier coefficients of holomorphic Siegel cusp forms of degree two which are Hecke eigenforms to central special values of $L$-functions. The formula is regarded as a natural generalization of the B\"ocherer conjecture to the non-trivial toroidal character case.</description>
