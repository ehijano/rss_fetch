      <title>Photodetachment energy of negative hydrogen ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a high-precision calculation of the photodetachment energy of the hydrogen anion{\normalsize{} }$\text{H}^{-}$. The nonrelativistic bound-state energy is obtained using an exact three-body approach, and supplemented by leading relativistic, quantum-electrodynamic, finite-nuclear-size, and hyperfine corrections. Our result is $6083.06447(68)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ for the detachment to the hydrogen ground-state hyperfine level $\smash{(F=0)}$, which is 220 times more precise than the best experimental determination to date, $6082.99(15)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, as reported by Lykke \textit{et al. }Beyond their intrinsic interest, these results provide critical input for antihydrogen physics, where controlled photodetachment of $\smash{\bar{\text{H}}^{+}}$ offers a path to producing ultracold antihydrogen (and its isotopes) for precision experiments. Corresponding calculations for the negative deuterium and tritium ions yield $6086.70676(68)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ for $^{2}\text{H}^{-}(F=1/2)$ and $6087.87924(68)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ for $^{3}\text{H}^{-}(F=0)$.</description>

      <title>Features of the van der Waals Interaction on the Cesium $6S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7P_{3/2}$ Transition in an Optical Nanocell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental study of the influence of a dielectric surface on the transmission spectrum of cesium atoms for the $6S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7P_{3/2}$ ($D_2$) transition in vapor cells with thicknesses in the range $50$-$250\,$nm. The measurements were performed using a homemade optical nanocell filled with atomic cesium and featuring a wedge-shaped gap between the inner surfaces of sapphire windows. For atom-surface distances below approximately $300$\,nm, a significant red shift of the atomic transition frequency is observed due to van der Waals (vdW) interactions with the dielectric surface. An additional red shift arises at high vapor pressures owing to Cs-Cs interactions, with a measured contribution of $15$\,MHz/Torr, which must be accounted for in order to correctly determine the vdW coefficient $C_3$. By recording transmission spectra of the nanocell at different thicknesses, we determine for the first time the vdW coefficient for the Cs $6S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7P_{3/2}$ transition, obtaining values in the range $C_3 \sim 2- 20$\,kHz\,$\mu$m$^3$. These results are of interest for fundamental studies of atom-surface interactions and are also relevant for the development of miniature sensors based on atomic vapors, in particular compact frequency references exploiting atomic transitions in the blue spectral region.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-controlled thermal activation in pyramidal Coulomb clusters: Testing Kramers-Langer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-cooled ions confined in electromagnetic traps provide a unique, tunable mesoscopic system where the interplay of the trapping potential, nonlinear Coulomb interactions, and laser-ion scattering generates rich, collective dynamics. In this work, we engineer thermally activated switching between two oppositely oriented, square-pyramidal configurations of five laser-cooled ions in a Paul trap. For identical ions ($^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), the inversions proceed via a \textit{Berry pseudo-rotation} mechanism with a low activation barrier, enabled by the permutation symmetry, in contrast to the \textit{umbrella inversion} observed in ammonia. The experimentally measured inversion rates, spanning two orders of magnitude, are accurately captured by the multidimensional Kramers-Langer theory, enabling thermometry of the Doppler-cooled ion cluster at $1.8 \pm 0.1$ mK. By substituting the apex ion with a heavier isotope ($^{44}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), we break the permutation symmetry and observe a suppression of thermally activated inversions. Numerical analysis reveals that this symmetry breaking closes the low-barrier channel, forcing the system to invert through a high-barrier \textit{turnstile rotation}. Thus, we demonstrate a structural analogue of molecular kinetic isotope effects, establishing trapped ions as a versatile platform to explore symmetry-controlled collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological sensing of superfluid rotation using non-Hermitian optical dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a non-Hermitian optical dimer whose parameters are renormalized by dispersive and dissipative backaction from the coupling of the passive cavity with a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell \hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid.</description>

      <title>Bound state solutions with a linear combination of Yuakawa plus four-parameter diatomic potentials using path integral approach: Thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximate analytical bound states with a linear combination of two diatomic molecule potentials, Yukawa and four parameters potentials, within the framework of the path integral formalism. With the help of an appropriate approximation to evaluate the centrifugal term, the energy spectrum and the normalized wave functions of the bound states are derived from the poles of Green's function and its residues. The partition function and other thermodynamic properties were obtained using the compact form of the energy equation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Microwave Sensing with Dissipative Continuous Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dissipative time crystal is an emergent phase in driven-dissipative quantum many-body systems, characterized by sustained oscillations that break time-translation symmetry spontaneously. Here, we explore nonequilibrium phase transitions in a dissipative Rydberg system driven by a microwave (MW) field and demonstrate their critical sensitivity to high-precision MW sensing. Distinct dynamical regimes are identified, including monostable, bistable, and oscillatory phases under mean-field coupling. Unlike single-particle detection--where the beating signal decays linearly with MW field strength--the time crystalline phase exhibits high sensitivity to MW perturbations, with rapid, discontinuous frequency switching near the monostable-oscillatory boundary. The abrupt transition is rooted in spontaneous symmetry breaking in time and is fundamentally insensitive to the background noise. On this basis, a minimum detectable MW field strength on the order of 1nV/cm is achieved by leveraging this sensitivity. Our results establish a framework for controlling time crystalline phases with external fields and advance MW sensing through many-body effects.</description>

      <title>Stability and mixed phases of three-component droplets in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the ground state properties and excitation spectra of one-dimensional three-component bosonic mixtures accommodating a droplet in two of the species and a third minority component. Relying on the suitable Lee-Huang-Yang framework, we reveal a plethora of distinct self-bound droplet phases and their phase transitions through variations of either the particle number of the majority components or the intercomponent coupling. The ensuing phases demonstrate that the minority component is being un-trapped, partially trapped, or fully trapped by the majority droplet species. These states are characterized by their binding energies captured by the chemical potentials and their low-amplitude excitation spectrum, including mode crossings at the particle-emission threshold. We further derive effective reduced models which are valid in the high-imbalance limit, and accurately reproduce the numerically computed ground states, while providing analytical insights into the role of quantum fluctuations. Our results map out the stability and structure of mixed droplet phases offering guidance into forthcoming experimental and theoretical studies of multicomponent quantum droplets.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Analysis of Ro-Vibrational Helical Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helical dichroism (HD) is a proposed method for the resolution of molecular chirality, employing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. Going beyond the conventional assumptions about HD, this work proposes a rigid theoretical framework for the analysis of the HD, based on molecular symmetries and rotational eigenstates. We derive the rotational selection rules, which clearly establish that HD only emerges from the spin-orbit coupling of light, even for beams without far-field OAM. Our findings refine the conditions for observing HD, shedding light on the outcome of prior experiments and guiding future designs for chiral sensing using structured light.</description>

      <title>Fast hydrogen atom diffraction through monocrystalline graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains. Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.</description>
