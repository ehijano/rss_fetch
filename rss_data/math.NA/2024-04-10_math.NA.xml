      <title>The Tensor-Train Stochastic Finite Volume Method for Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic finite volume method offers an efficient one-pass approach for assessing uncertainty in hyperbolic conservation laws. Still, it struggles with the curse of dimensionality when dealing with multiple stochastic variables. We introduce the stochastic finite volume method within the tensor-train framework to counteract this limitation. This integration, however, comes with its own set of difficulties, mainly due to the propensity for shock formation in hyperbolic systems. To overcome these issues, we have developed a tensor-train-adapted stochastic finite volume method that employs a global WENO reconstruction, making it suitable for such complex systems. This approach represents the first step in designing tensor-train techniques for hyperbolic systems and conservation laws involving shocks.</description>

      <title>An Energy Stable High-Order Cut Cell Discontinuous Galerkin Method with State Redistribution for Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cut meshes are a type of mesh that is formed by allowing embedded boundaries to "cut" a simple underlying mesh resulting in a hybrid mesh of cut and standard elements. While cut meshes can allow complex boundaries to be represented well regardless of the mesh resolution, their arbitrarily shaped and sized cut elements can present issues such as the small cell problem, where small cut elements can result in a severely restricted CFL condition. State redistribution, a technique developed by Berger and Giuliani [1], can be used to address the small cell problem. In this work, we pair state redistribution with a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme that is $L_2$ energy stable for arbitrary quadrature. We prove that state redistribution can be added to a provably $L_2$ energy stable discontinuous Galerkin method on a cut mesh without damaging the scheme's $L_2$ stability. We numerically verify the high order accuracy and stability of our scheme on two-dimensional wave propagation problems.</description>

      <title>A general class of iterative splitting methods for solving linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Ahmadi et al. (2021) and Tagliaferro (2022) proposed some iterative methods for the numerical solution of linear systems which, under the classical hypothesis of strict diagonal dominance, typically converge faster than the Jacobi method, but slower than the forward/backward Gauss-Seidel one. In this paper we introduce a general class of iterative methods, based on suitable splittings of the matrix that defines the system, which include all of the methods mentioned above and have the same cost per iteration in a sequential computation environment. We also introduce a partial order relation in the set of the splittings and, partly theoretically and partly on the basis of a certain number of examples, we show that such partial order is typically connected to the speed of convergence of the corresponding methods. We pay particular attention to the case of linear systems for which the Jacobi iteration matrix is nonnegative, in which case we give a rigorous proof of the correspondence between the partial order relation and the magnitude of the spectral radius of the iteration matrices. Within the considered general class, some new specific promising methods are proposed as well.</description>

      <title>Solving Parametric PDEs with Radial Basis Functions and Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the POD-DNN, a novel algorithm leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) along with radial basis functions (RBFs) in the context of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reduced basis method (RBM), aimed at approximating the parametric mapping of parametric partial differential equations on irregular domains. The POD-DNN algorithm capitalizes on the low-dimensional characteristics of the solution manifold for parametric equations, alongside the inherent offline-online computational strategy of RBM and DNNs. In numerical experiments, POD-DNN demonstrates significantly accelerated computation speeds during the online phase. Compared to other algorithms that utilize RBF without integrating DNNs, POD-DNN substantially improves the computational speed in the online inference process. Furthermore, under reasonable assumptions, we have rigorously derived upper bounds on the complexity of approximating parametric mappings with POD-DNN, thereby providing a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Projection method for quasiperiodic elliptic equations and application to quasiperiodic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, our main objective is to address the challenge of solving elliptic equations with quasiperiodic coefficients. To achieve accurate and efficient computation, we introduce the projection method, which enables the embedding of quasiperiodic systems into higher-dimensional periodic systems. To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix, reducing memory requirements while preserving accuracy. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, we apply our method to achieve a highly accurate computation of the homogenized coefficients for a quasiperiodic multiscale elliptic equation.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion for all $H\in(0,1)$ using WIS integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the numerical approximation of a quasilinear stochastic differential equation (SDE) with multiplicative fractional Brownian motion. The stochastic integral is interpreted in the Wick-It\^o-Skorohod (WIS) sense that is well defined and centered for all $H\in(0,1)$. We give an introduction to the theory of WIS integration before we examine existence and uniqueness of a solution to the SDE. We then introduce our numerical method which is based on the theoretical results in \cite{Mishura2008article, Mishura2008} for $H\geq \frac{1}{2}$. We construct explicitly a translation operator required for the practical implementation of the method and are not aware of any other implementation of a numerical method for the WIS SDE. We then prove a strong convergence result that gives, in the non-autonomous case, an error of $O(\Delta t^H)$ and in the non-autonomous case $O(\Delta t^{\min(H,\zeta)})$, where $\zeta$ is a H\"older continuity parameter. We present some numerical experiments and conjecture that the theoretical results may not be optimal since we observe numerically a rate of $\min(H+\frac{1}{2},1)$ in the autonomous case. This work opens up the possibility to efficiently simulate SDEs for all $H$ values, including small values of $H$ when the stochastic integral is interpreted in the WIS sense.</description>

      <title>Iterative solvers in adaptive FEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides an overview of state-of-the-art adaptive finite element methods (AFEMs) for the numerical solution of second-order elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), where the primary focus is on the optimal interplay of local mesh refinement and iterative solution of the arising discrete systems. Particular emphasis is placed on the thorough description of the essential ingredients necessary to design adaptive algorithms of optimal complexity, i.e., algorithms that mathematically guarantee the optimal rate of convergence with respect to the overall computational cost and, hence, time. Crucially, adaptivity induces reliability of the computed numerical approximations by means of a-posteriori error control. This ensures that the error committed by the numerical scheme is bounded from above by computable quantities. The analysis of the adaptive algorithms is based on the study of appropriate quasi-error quantities that include and balance different components of the overall error. Importantly, the quasi-errors stemming from an adaptive algorithm with contractive iterative solver satisfy a centerpiece concept, namely, full R-linear convergence. This guarantees that the adaptive algorithm is essentially contracting this quasi-error at each step and it turns out to be the cornerstone for the optimal complexity of AFEM. The unified analysis of the adaptive algorithms is presented in the context of symmetric linear PDEs. Extensions to goal-oriented, non-symmetric, as well as non-linear PDEs are presented with suitable nested iterative solvers fitting into the general analytical framework of the linear symmetric case. Numerical experiments highlight the theoretical results and emphasize the practical relevance and gain of adaptivity with iterative solvers for numerical simulations with optimal complexity.</description>

      <title>A conservative Eulerian finite element method for transport and diffusion in moving domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a finite element method for an Eulerian formulation of partial differential equations governing the transport and diffusion of a scalar quantity in a time-dependent domain. The method follows the idea from Lehrenfeld &amp; Olshanskii [ESAIM: M2AN, 53(2): 585-614, 2019] of a solution extension to realise the Eulearian time-stepping scheme. However, a reformulation of the partial differential equation is suggested to derive a scheme which conserves the quantity under consideration exactly on the discrete level. For the spatial discretisation, the paper considers an unfitted finite element method. Ghost-penalty stabilisation is used to release the discrete solution extension and gives a scheme robust against arbitrary intersections between the mesh and geometry interface. The stability is analysed for both first- and second-order backward differentiation formula versions of the scheme. Several numerical examples in two and three spatial dimensions are included to illustrate the potential of this method.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Guided Gauss-Newton Method for Shallow ReLU Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a structure-guided Gauss-Newton (SgGN) method for solving least squares problems using a shallow ReLU neural network. The method effectively takes advantage of both the least squares structure and the neural network structure of the objective function. By categorizing the weights and biases of the hidden and output layers of the network as nonlinear and linear parameters, respectively, the method iterates back and forth between the nonlinear and linear parameters. The nonlinear parameters are updated by a damped Gauss-Newton method and the linear ones are updated by a linear solver. Moreover, at the Gauss-Newton step, a special form of the Gauss-Newton matrix is derived for the shallow ReLU neural network and is used for efficient iterations. It is shown that the corresponding mass and Gauss-Newton matrices in the respective linear and nonlinear steps are symmetric and positive definite under reasonable assumptions. Thus, the SgGN method naturally produces an effective search direction without the need of additional techniques like shifting in the Levenberg-Marquardt method to achieve invertibility of the Gauss-Newton matrix. The convergence and accuracy of the method are demonstrated numerically for several challenging function approximation problems, especially those with discontinuities or sharp transition layers that pose significant challenges for commonly used training algorithms in machine learning.</description>

Abstract: This article conducts a reexamination of the research conducted by Kwasniewski et al., focusing on their adaptation of the 2.5D LU factorization algorithm with tournament pivoting, known as \func{COnfLUX}. Our reexamination reveals potential concerns regarding the upper bound, empirical investigation methods, and lower bound, despite the original study providing a theoretical foundation and an instantiation of the proposed algorithm. This paper offers a reexamination of these matters, highlighting probable shortcomings in the original investigation. Our observations are intended to enhance the development and comprehension of parallel matrix factorization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consequence of two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, being close throughout a subset of their domain. A particular consequence of our results is the following. Given $K_0 &gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\gamma &gt; \eta &gt; 0$ there is a constant $\delta = \delta(\gamma,\eta,\varepsilon,K_0) &gt; 0$ for which the following is true. Let $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and $f , h : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lip$(\gamma)$ functions whose Lip$(\gamma)$ norms are both bounded above by $K_0$. Suppose $B \subset \Sigma$ is closed and that $f$ and $h$ coincide throughout $B$. Then over the set of points in $\Sigma$ whose distance to $B$ is at most $\delta$ we have that the Lip$(\eta)$ norm of the difference $f-h$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon$. More generally, we establish that this phenomenon remains valid in a less restrictive Banach space setting under the weaker hypothesis that the two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions $f$ and $h$ are only close in a pointwise sense throughout the closed subset $B$. We require only that the subset $\Sigma$ be closed; in particular, the case that $\Sigma$ is finite is covered by our results. The restriction that $\eta &lt; \gamma$ is sharp in the sense that our result is false for $\eta := \gamma$.</description>

      <title>Edge Detection Quantumized: A Novel Quantum Algorithm For Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum image processing is a research field that explores the use of quantum computing and algorithms for image processing tasks such as image encoding and edge detection. Although classical edge detection algorithms perform reasonably well and are quite efficient, they become outright slower when it comes to large datasets with high-resolution images. Quantum computing promises to deliver a significant performance boost and breakthroughs in various sectors. Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) algorithm, for example, works at constant time complexity, and thus detects edges much faster than any classical algorithm. However, the original QHED algorithm is designed for Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE) and mainly works for binary images. This paper presents a novel protocol by combining the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) encoding and a modified QHED algorithm. An improved edge outline method has been proposed in this work resulting in a better object outline output and more accurate edge detection than the traditional QHED algorithm.</description>

      <title>POD Suboptimal Control of Evolution Problems: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work is organized as follows. First an introduction is given in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 we introduce the POD method in finite and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and discuss various applications. Chapter 3 is devoted to to POD-based Galerkin schemes for evolution problems. Mainly, we study linear problems taking different discretization methods into account. We provide a certified a-priori and a-posteriori error analysis. Furthermore, the numerical realizations are explained and illustrated by test examples. Quadratic programming problems governed by liner evolution problems are investigated in Chapter 4. As in Chapter 3 we present a certified a-priori and a-posteriori error analysis. Moreover, we discuss basis update strategies. In Chapter 5 we give an outlook to further directions in reduced-order modeling in optimal control and optimization. More precisely, a nonlinear optimal control problem is studied. Moreover, state-constrained optimization problems are solved by a tailored combination of primal-dual active set methods and POD-aesed reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, POD Galerkin methods for multiobjective optimal control problems are investigated. Finally, some required theoretical foundations are summarized in the appendix.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Newton Approach for Min-Max Optimization in Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel first-order method is proposed for training generative adversarial networks (GANs). It modifies the Gauss-Newton method to approximate the min-max Hessian and uses the Sherman-Morrison inversion formula to calculate the inverse. The method corresponds to a fixed-point method that ensures necessary contraction. To evaluate its effectiveness, numerical experiments are conducted on various datasets commonly used in image generation tasks, such as MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, FFHQ, and LSUN. Our method is capable of generating high-fidelity images with greater diversity across multiple datasets. It also achieves the highest inception score for CIFAR10 among all compared methods, including state-of-the-art second-order methods. Additionally, its execution time is comparable to that of first-order min-max methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamical low-rank approximation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation with piecewise linear spatial boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) for the numerical simulation of Vlasov--Poisson equations based on separation of space and velocity variables, as proposed in several recent works. The standard approach for the time integration in the DLRA model uses a splitting of the tangent space projector for the low-rank manifold according to the separated variables. It can also be modified to allow for rank-adaptivity. A less studied aspect is the incorporation of boundary conditions in the DLRA model. We propose a variational formulation of the projector splitting which allows to handle inflow boundary conditions on spatial domains with piecewise linear boundary. Numerical experiments demonstrate the principle feasibility of this approach.</description>

      <title>A provably stable numerical method for the anisotropic diffusion equation in confined magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel numerical method for solving the anisotropic diffusion equation in magnetic fields confined to a periodic box which is accurate and provably stable. We derive energy estimates of the solution of the continuous initial boundary value problem. A discrete formulation is presented using operator splitting in time with the summation by parts finite difference approximation of spatial derivatives for the perpendicular diffusion operator. Weak penalty procedures are derived for implementing both boundary conditions and parallel diffusion operator obtained by field line tracing. We prove that the fully-discrete approximation is unconditionally stable. Discrete energy estimates are shown to match the continuous energy estimate given the correct choice of penalty parameters. A nonlinear penalty parameter is shown to provide an effective method for tuning the parallel diffusion penalty and significantly minimises rounding errors. Several numerical experiments, using manufactured solutions, the ``NIMROD benchmark'' problem and a single island problem, are presented to verify numerical accuracy, convergence, and asymptotic preserving properties of the method. Finally, we present a magnetic field with chaotic regions and islands and show the contours of the anisotropic diffusion equation reproduce key features in the field.</description>

      <title>Data Generation-based Operator Learning for Solving Partial Differential Equations on Unbounded Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave propagation problems are typically formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs) on unbounded domains to be solved. The classical approach to solving such problems involves truncating them to problems on bounded domains by designing the artificial boundary conditions or perfectly matched layers, which typically require significant effort, and the presence of nonlinearity in the equation makes such designs even more challenging. Emerging deep learning-based methods for solving PDEs, with the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) method as a representative, still face significant challenges when directly used to solve PDEs on unbounded domains. Calculations performed in a bounded domain of interest without imposing boundary constraints can lead to a lack of unique solutions thus causing the failure of PINNs. In light of this, this paper proposes a novel and effective operator learning-based method for solving PDEs on unbounded domains. The key idea behind this method is to generate high-quality training data. Specifically, we construct a family of approximate analytical solutions to the target PDE based on its initial condition and source term. Then, using these constructed data comprising exact solutions, initial conditions, and source terms, we train an operator learning model called MIONet, which is capable of handling multiple inputs, to learn the mapping from the initial condition and source term to the PDE solution on a bounded domain of interest. Finally, we utilize the generalization ability of this model to predict the solution of the target PDE. The effectiveness of this method is exemplified by solving the wave equation and the Schrodinger equation defined on unbounded domains. More importantly, the proposed method can deal with nonlinear problems, which has been demonstrated by solving Burger's equation and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving finite element method for the multi-phase Mullins-Sekerka problem with triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a sharp interface formulation for the multi-phase Mullins-Sekerka flow. The flow is characterized by a network of curves evolving such that the total surface energy of the curves is reduced, while the areas of the enclosed phases are conserved. Making use of a variational formulation, we introduce a fully discrete finite element method. Our discretization features a parametric approximation of the moving interfaces that is independent of the discretization used for the equations in the bulk. The scheme can be shown to be unconditionally stable and to satisfy an exact volume conservation property. Moreover, an inherent tangential velocity for the vertices on the discrete curves leads to asymptotically equidistributed vertices, meaning no remeshing is necessary in practice. Several numerical examples, including a convergence experiment for the three-phase Mullins-Sekerka flow, demonstrate the capabilities of the introduced method.</description>

      <title>Robust Methods for Multiscale Coarse Approximations of Diffusion Models in Perforated Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Poisson equation posed in a domain containing a large number of polygonal perforations, we propose a low-dimensional coarse approximation space based on a coarse polygonal partitioning of the domain. Similarly to other multiscale numerical methods, this coarse space is spanned by locally discrete harmonic basis functions. Along the subdomain boundaries, the basis functions are piecewise polynomial. The main contribution of this article is an error estimate regarding the H1-projection over the coarse space which depends only on the regularity of the solution over the edges of the coarse partitioning. For a specific edge refinement procedure, the error analysis establishes superconvergence of the method even if the true solution has a low general regularity. Combined with domain decomposition (DD) methods, the coarse space leads to an efficient two-level iterative linear solver which reaches the fine-scale finite element error in few iterations. It also bodes well as a preconditioner for Krylov methods and provides scalability with respect to the number of subdomains. Numerical experiments showcase the increased precision of the coarse approximation as well as the efficiency and scalability of the coarse space as a component of a DD algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We prove the uniform convergence of the geometric multigrid V-cycle for hybrid high-order (HHO) and other discontinuous skeletal methods. Our results generalize previously established results for HDG methods, and our multigrid method uses standard smoothers and local solvers that are bounded, convergent, and consistent. We use a weak version of elliptic regularity in our proofs. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev and The Fast Fourier Transform Methods for Signal Interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximation theorem is one of the most important aspects of numerical analysis that has evolved over the years with many different approaches. Some of the most popular approximation methods include the Lebesgue approximation theorem, the Weierstrass approximation, and the Fourier approximation theorem. The limitations associated with various approximation methods are too crucial to ignore, and thus, the nature of a specific dataset may require using a specific approximation method for such estimates. In this report, we shall delve into Chebyshev's polynomials interpolation in detail as an alternative approach to reconstructing signals and compare the reconstruction to that of the Fourier polynomials. We will also explore the advantages and limitations of the Chebyshev polynomials and discuss in detail their mathematical formulation and equivalence to the cosine function over a given interval [a, b].</description>

      <title>On the robustness of double-word addition algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, even when there are moderate overlaps in the inputs of sloppy or accurate double-word addition algorithms in the QD library, these algorithms still guarantee error bounds of $O(u^2(|a|+|b|))$ in faithful rounding. Furthermore, the accurate algorithm can achieve a relative error bound of $O(u^2)$ in the presence of moderate overlaps in the inputs when rounding function is round-to-nearest. The relative error bound also holds in directed rounding, but certain additional conditions are required. Consequently, in double-word multiplication and addition operations, we can safely omit the normalization step of double-word multiplication and replace the accurate addition algorithm with the sloppy one. Numerical experiments confirm that this approach nearly doubles the performance of double-word multiplication and addition operations, with negligible precision costs. Moreover, in directed rounding mode, the signs of the errors of the two algorithms are consistent with the rounding direction, even in the presence of input overlap. This allows us to avoid changing the rounding mode in interval arithmetic. We also prove that the relative error bound of the sloppy addition algorithm exceeds $3u^2$ if and only if the input meets the condition of Sterbenz's Lemma when rounding to nearest. These findings suggest that the two addition algorithms are more robust than previously believed.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and numerical analysis of an elapsed time model with strongly coupled neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elapsed time equation is an age-structured model that describes dynamics of interconnected spiking neurons through the elapsed time since the last discharge, leading to many interesting questions on the evolution of the system from a mathematical and biological point of view. In this work, we first deal with the case when transmission after a spike is instantaneous and the case when there exists a distributed delay that depends on previous history of the system, which is a more realistic assumption. Then we study the well-posedness and the numerical analysis of the elapsed time models. For existence and uniqueness we improve the previous works by relaxing some hypothesis on the nonlinearity, including the strongly excitatory case, while for the numerical analysis we prove that the approximation given by the explicit upwind scheme converges to the solution of the non-linear problem. We also show some numerical simulations to compare the behavior of the system in the case of instantaneous transmission with the case of distributed delay under different parameters, leading to solutions with different asymptotic profiles.</description>
