      <title>Climate change impacts on supra-permafrost soil and aquifer hydrology: broader, deeper, and longer activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal dynamics and hydrology of active layer soils and supra-permafrost aquifers determine the fate of the vast pool of carbon that they hold. In permafrost watersheds of Arctic Alaska, air temperature has warmed by up to 3.5 {\deg}C and snowfall has increased by up to ~40 mm from 1981 to 2020. How these changes impact the seasonal to decadal hydrological activity of the carbon-rich aquifers is mostly unknown. Observation-informed thermal hydrology modeling of a hillslope drained by a headwater stream (Imnavait Creek) within continuous permafrost showed profound changes from 1981 to 2020. Warmer summer temperatures deepened annual thaw depths. Steadily warming winter air temperatures, heavier snowfall, and stored energy from summer increased annual water outflow from the hillslope aquifer to the stream, warmed soil temperatures, and expanded and prolonged zero-curtain (stable at 0 {\deg}C) zones. In 2017-2018, zero-curtain areas with liquid water persisted through winter. Our findings reveal that both summer and winter warming drive year-round aquifer dynamics, creating conditions that amplify the permafrost-carbon-climate feedback.</description>

      <title>Axial Seamount Eruption Forecasting Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Axial Seamount Eruption Forecasting Experiment (EFE), a real-time initiative designed to test the predictability of volcanic eruptions through a transparent, physics-based framework. The experiment is inspired by the Financial Bubble Experiment, adapting its principles of digital authentication, timestamped archiving, and delayed disclosure to the field of volcanology. The EFE implements a reproducible protocol in which each forecast is securely timestamped and cryptographically hashed (SHA-256) before being made public. The corresponding forecast documents, containing detailed diagnostics and probabilistic analyses, will be released after the next eruption or, if the forecasts are proven incorrect, at a later date. This procedure ensures full transparency while preventing premature interpretation or controversy surrounding public predictions. Forecasts will be issued monthly, or more frequently if required, using real-time monitoring data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative's Regional Cabled Array at Axial Seamount. By committing to publish all forecasts, successful or not, the EFE establishes a scientifically rigorous, falsifiable protocol to evaluate the limits of eruption forecasting. The ultimate goal is to transform eruption prediction into a cumulative and testable science founded on open verification, reproducibility, and physical understanding.</description>
