      <title>Functional calculus on weighted Sobolev spaces for the Laplacian on rough domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Laplace operator on domains subject to Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We show that these operators admit a bounded $H^{\infty}$-functional calculus on weighted Sobolev spaces, where the weights are powers of the distance to the boundary. Our analysis applies to bounded $C^{1,\lambda}$-domains with $\lambda\in[0,1]$, revealing a crucial trade-off: lower domain regularity can be compensated by enlarging the weight exponent. As a primary consequence, we establish maximal regularity for the corresponding heat equation. This extends the well-posedness theory for parabolic equations to domains with minimal smoothness, where classical methods are inapplicable.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy problem for the integrable RZQ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the new, integrable, fifth order Camassa-Holm (CH) type equation derived by Reyes, Zhu, and Qiao, which we call the RZQ equation. The $m$-form of this equation possesses a striking similarity to the m-form of the CH equation. However, unlike the CH equation, the nonlocal form of this equation cannot be interpreted as a nonlocal perturbation of Burgers' equation.
  We prove that the initial value problem corresponding to the RZQ equation is well-posed in the sense of Hadamard, in Sobolev spaces $H^s$, $s&gt;7/2$. We further show that the data-to-solution map is not uniformly continuous. We also show that the RZQ equation is ill-posed in $H^s$ for $s&lt;7/2$ in the non-periodic case.</description>

      <title>Local and global solvability of the Grushin heat equation with mixed nonlinear memory and reaction terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the solvability of a heat equation involving the Grushin operator. The equation is perturbed by two nonlinear reaction terms, one of which includes a memory component, introducing nonlocal effects in time. We first establish local well-posedness results in both Lebesgue spaces and in the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity. Furthermore, we develop and apply comparison principles that allow us to derive sufficient conditions for the global existence of solutions, depending on the relative strength and nature of the nonlinearities involved. In particular, we highlight how the presence of the memory term influences global solvability. Our results contribute to the understanding of parabolic equations with degenerate operators and complex nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>H\"older stability of an inverse spectral problem for the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator on a simple manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that on a simple Riemannian manifold, the electric potential and the solenoidal part of the magnetic potential appearing in the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator can be recovered H\"older stably from the boundary spectral data. This data contains the eigenvalues and the Neumann traces of the corresponding sequence of Dirichlet eigenfunctions of the operator. Our proof contains two parts, which we present in the reverse order. (1) We show that the boundary spectral data can be stably obtained from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated with the respective initial boundary value problem for a hyperbolic equation, whose leading order terms are a priori known. (2) We construct geometric optics solutions to the hyperbolic equation, which reduce the stable recovery of the lower order terms to the stable inversion of the geodesic ray transform of one-forms and functions.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for the Keller--Segel--Navier--Stokes system with nonlinear boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Keller--Segel--Navier--Stokes system with nonlinear boundary conditions in a bounded smooth (and not necessarily convex) domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$, $N \ge 2$, where the chemotactic sensitivity $S$ is assumed to have values in $\mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ which accounts for rotational fluxes. In contrast to the case where $S$ is a scalar-valued function (or $S$ is the identity matrix), in our system, the normal derivative for the density $n$ of the cell is given as the product of the unknown functions, i.e., the function $n$ satisfies the nonlinear boundary condition. We show the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions to the system under the smallness assumptions of given data, where the Lipschitz continuity of the solution mapping and the asymptotic stability of the solution are also shown. The proof is based on maximal regularity results for the linear heat equation and the Stokes system, where we establish a new maximal regularity theorem for some linear heat equation with an inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition. Since we develop a direct approach to construct the solutions (i.e., without considering limiting procedure in certain regularized problem with homogeneous linear boundary conditions), our solutions indeed satisfy the boundary conditions, which was not addressed clearly in the previous contributions by Cao and Lankeit (2016) as well as Yu, Wang, and Zheng (2018). Under suitable regularity conditions on given data, the solution may be understood in a classical sense and, as a by-product, the non-negativity result is proved via the maximum principle of a new type.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary regularity for mixed local and nonlocal equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide sharp boundary regularity estimates for solutions to elliptic equations driven by an integro-differential operator obtained as the sum of a Laplacian with a nonlocal operator generalizing a fractional Laplacian.
  Our approach makes use of weighted H\"older spaces as well as regularity estimates for the Laplacian in this context and a fixed-point argument.
  We show the optimality of the obtained estimates by means of a counterexample that we have striven to keep as explicit as possible.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dirichlet problems with an overdetermined nonlocal Neumann condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and quantitative approximate symmetry for an overdetermined problem related to the fractional torsion equation in a regular open, bounded set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Specifically, we show that if $\overline{\Omega}$ has positive reach and the nonlocal normal derivative introduced in (Dipierro, Ros-Oton, Valdinoci, Rev. Mat. Iberoam. 33 (2017), no. 2, 377-416) is constant on an external surface parallel and sufficiently close to $\partial \Omega$, then $\Omega$ must be a ball. Remarkably, this conclusion remains valid under the sole assumption that $\Omega$ is convex. Moreover, we analyze the quantitative stability of this result under two distinct sets of assumptions on $\Omega$. Finally, we extend our analysis to a broader class of overdetermined Dirichlet problems involving the fractional Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the local exact controllability of the KdV equation on torus around equilibrium states, where both the spatial control region and the temporal control region are sets of positive measure. The proof is based on a novel strategy for proving observability inequalities on space-time measurable sets. This approach is applicable to a broad class of dispersive equations on torus.</description>

      <title>Individual-Based Foundation of SIR-Type Epidemic Models: mean-field limit and large time behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of the statistical distributions of the population densities in the three compartments of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, under epidemic spreading driven by susceptible-infectious interactions. The model is based on a system of Boltzmann-type equations describing binary interactions between susceptible and infectious individuals, supplemented with linear redistribution operators that account for recovery and reinfection dynamics. The mean values of the kinetic system recover a SIR-type model with reinfection, where the macroscopic parameters are explicitly derived from the underlying microscopic interaction rules. In the grazing collision regime, the Boltzmann system can be approximated by a system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations. This limit allows for a more tractable analysis of the dynamics, including the large-time behavior of the population densities. In this context, we rigorously prove the convergence to equilibrium of the resulting mean-field system in a suitable Sobolev space by means of the so-called energy distance. The analysis reveals the dissipative structure of the dynamics and the role of the interaction terms in driving the system toward a stable equilibrium configuration. These results provide a multi-scale perspective connecting kinetic theory with classical epidemic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct partitions of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into three sets $\{\mathscr{X}(1),\mathscr{X}(2),\mathscr{X}(3)\}$ that locally minimize interfacial area among compactly supported volume preserving variations and that blow down at infinity to singular area-minimizing cones. As a consequence, we prove the non-uniqueness of the standard lens cluster in a large number of dimensions starting from $8$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of dead core solutions in indefinite elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonnegative solutions of indefinite elliptic problems which enjoy the dead core phenomenon. Our model is the subhomogeneous problem $$ -\Delta_p u = (a^+(x) - \mu a^-(x))|u|^{q-2}u, \quad u \in W_0^{1,p}(\Omega), $$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $1&lt;q&lt;p$, and $\mu &gt; 0$. Thanks to a dead core formation property, we obtain multiple nonnegative dead core solutions of this problem for $\mu$ large enough. This assertion, in combination with a uniqueness feature, yields an exact multiplicity result, which gives a precise description of the nonnegative solutions set of this problem for large values of $\mu$. We also extend the multiplicity result to other classes of problems.</description>

      <title>Well posedness and propagation of chaos for multi-agent models with strategies and diffusive effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-agent model for individuals endowed with strategies and subject to diffusive effects is proposed. The microscopic state of each agent is described by a spatial position and a probability measure, interpreted as a mixed strategy, over a compact metric space. The evolution is governed by a non-local interaction mechanism and by stochastic effects acting on the spatial component of the state. The well-posedness of the multi-agent system and that of a certain McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equation are proved. Eventually, a propagation of chaos result is obtained, which guarantees that the former model converges to the latter as the number of agents goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to the emergence of domain structures in magnetostrictive solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variational model for magnetoelastic solids in the large-strain setting with the magnetization field defined on the unknown deformed configuration. Through a simultaneous linearization of the deformation and sharp-interface limit of the magnetization with respect to the easy axes, performed in terms of $\Gamma$-convergence, we identify a variational model describing the formation of domain structures and accounting for magnetostriction in the small-strain setting. Our analysis incorporates the effect of magnetic fields and, for uniaxial materials, ensures the regularity of minimizers of the effective energy.</description>

Abstract: We consider the liquid drop model with a positive background density in the thermodynamic limit. We prove a two-term asymptotics for the ground state energy per unit volume in the dilute limit. Our proof justifies the expectation that optimal configurations consist of droplets of unit size that arrange themselves according to minimizers for the Jellium problem for point particles. In particular, we provide the first rigorous derivation of what is known as the gnocchi phase in astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: By a new orthogonal direct sum decomposition $E_{M} = Y \oplus Z$, which $Z$ is related to $\Delta u_i(i=1,2,3,....,M)$, and a new functional $I(u)$, the method in [2] is improved to obtain new multiple periodic solutions with negativity hypothesis on $F$ for a second-order discrete Hamiltonian system. Moreover, we exhibit an instructive example to make our result more clear, which hasn't been solved by the known results.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the It\^o stochastic differential equations with $\mR^{d\times k}$ diffusions in class of H\"older spaces and continuous $\mR^d$ drifts. We derive a uniqueness result of strong solutions for $\cC^\alpha \ (\alpha\geq \frac{1}{2})$ coefficients and this result is new. Our proof is supported by It\^o's formula and a finer analysis on cut-off and smoothing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the Maxwell system of electrodynamics within the framework of distributions. A primary objective is to establish boundary conditions for fields at interfaces when the charge and current densities are measures localized on the interface. From this analysis, the paper presents a derivation of the generalized Snell's law, along with formulas for the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves in terms of the incident amplitude.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions to 2D semilinear wave equations with large data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in coupled semi-linear wave equations satisfying the null condition in two space dimensions, a basic model in nonlinear wave equations. Our aim is to establish global existence of smooth solutions to this system with large initial data of short pulse type. Major difficulties arise due to the largeness of initial data and the slow decay nature of 2D wave equations. To overcome the difficulties, by careful examination of the local solutions, we adapt various vector-field methods to different spacetime regions with several novel weighted energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Refined asymptotics for the Cauchy problem for the fast $p$-Laplace evolution equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our focus is on the fast diffusion equation driven by the $p$-Laplacian operator, that is $\partial_t u=\Delta_p u$ with $1&lt;p&lt;2$, posed in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 2$. The nonnegative solutions are expected to converge in time toward a stationary profile. While such convergence had been previously established for $p$ close to $2$, no quantitative rates were known, and the asymptotic behaviour remained poorly understood across the full fast diffusion range. In fact, the long time behaviour of solutions to the $p$-Laplace Cauchy problem drastically change in different subranges of the $p$. Some of them are analysed here for the first time.
  In this work, we provide the convergence rates for nonnegative, integrable solutions in the so-called good fast diffusion range, $p_c=\tfrac{2N}{N+1} &lt;p&lt;2$, where mass is conserved. We prove that solutions converge to a self-similar profile with matching mass, with explicit rates measured in relative error. Our constructive proof is based on a new entropy method that remains effective even when the entropy is not displacement convex -- where optimal transport techniques fail.
  In the very fast diffusion range $1&lt;p&lt;p_c$, we give the first asymptotic analysis near the extinction time. We uncover new critical exponents -- especially in high dimensions -- that give rise to markedly different qualitative behaviour depending on the value of $p$.
  We also establish convergence rates for the gradients of radial solutions in the good fast diffusion range, again measured in relative error. Finally, we analyze the structural properties required for the entropy method to apply, thereby opening a broader investigation into the basin of attraction of Barenblatt-type profiles, particularly in the singular case of $p$ close to $1$.</description>

      <title>Steady Contiguous Vortex-Patch Dipole Solutions of the 2D Incompressible Euler Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously construct the first steady traveling wave solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation that take the form of a contiguous vortex-patch dipole, which can be viewed as the vortex-patch counterpart of the well-known Lamb-Chaplygin dipole. Our construction is based on a novel fixed-point approach that determines the patch boundary as the fixed point of a certain nonlinear map. Smoothness and other properties of the patch boundary are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Von K\'arm\'an regime for thin plates under Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the stability of the Von K\'arm\'an model for thin plates subject to pure Neumann conditions and to dead loads, with no restriction on their direction. We prove a stability alternative, which extends previous results by Lecumberry and M\"uller in the Dirichlet case. Because of the rotation invariance of the problem, their notions of stability have to be modified and combined with the concept of optimal rotations due to Maor and Mora. Finally, we prove that the Von K\'arm\'an model is not compatible with some specific types of forces. Thus, for such, only the Kirchoff model applies.</description>

Without imposing any geometric restrictions on the domain, we establish the a priori estimates and derive the existence and uniqueness of admissible $C^{1,1}$ solutions under the condition $f^{\frac{1}{k-l}}\in C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega}\times\mathbb{R})$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the modified concavity inequality for complex Hessian equations
  under the semi-convexity assumption inspired by Lu \cite{Lu23} and Zhang \cite{Z24} for real case. Then second order estimates for admissible solutions of complex Hessian equations on compact Hermitian manifolds with both sides of equations depending on gradient terms are obtained by taking advantage of the crucial inequality.</description>

      <title>On Polyconvexity and Almgren Uniform Ellipticity With Respect to Polyhedral Test Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study anisotropic geometric energy functionals defined on a class of k-dimensional surfaces in a Euclidean space. The classical notion of ellipticity, coming from Almgren, for such functionals is investigated. We prove a variant of a recent result of De Rosa, Lei, and Young and show that uniform ellipticity of an anisotropic energy functional with respect to real polyhedral chains implies uniform polyconvexity of the integrand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study logarithmic double phase problems with variable exponents involving nonlinearities that have generalized critical growth. We first prove new continuous and compact embedding results in order to guarantee the well-definedness by studying the Sobolev conjugate function of our generalized $N$-function. In the second part we prove the concentration compactness principle for Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces having logarithmic double phase modular function structure. Based on this we are going to show multiplicity results for the problem under consideration for superlinear and sublinear growth, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the 2D Plasma-Vacuum Interface Problems for Ideal Incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the stability conditions for the well-posedness of the two-dimensional plasma-vacuum interface problems for ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, which describe the dynamics of conducting perfect fluids in a vacuum region under the influence of magnetic fields. Due to the counterexamples constructed by C. Hao and the second author [Comm. Math. Phys. 376 (2020), 259-286], the plasma-vacuum problems violating the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition and without surface tension are believed to be highly unstable or even ill-posed. However, based on a geometric perspective, we demonstrate that, although the initial data provided therein are ill-posed in the Lagrangian framework characterizing the regularity of flow maps, plasma-vacuum problems with such initial data can still be stable/well-posed in the Eulerian setting without involving flow maps, under the hypothesis that the total magnetic fields are non-degenerate on the free boundary. This discloses the essential difference between the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks of MHD free boundary problems and the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field. We also consider the surface tension effect and establish the local well-posedness theories in standard Sobolev spaces in this case. Furthermore, under either the non-degeneracy assumption on magnetic fields or the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition on the effective pressure, we prove vanishing surface tension limits. These results indicate that both capillary forces and non-degenerate tangential magnetic fields can stabilize the motion of the plasma-vacuum interface, and the stabilizing effect of surface tension is stronger than that of the tangential magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the multi-marginal Monge problem in the setting of compact metric spaces proving existence and uniqueness of solutions when the cost function is Lipschitz.

      <title>A non-linear damping structure and global stability of wave-Klein-Gordon coupled system in $\RR^{3+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global existence of solutions for a class of wave-Klein-Gordon coupled systems with specific nonlinearities in 3+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The study demonstrates that imposing certain constraints on the coefficients of these specific nonlinear terms induces a damping effect within the system, which is crucial for proving the global existence of solutions. The proof is conducted within the framework of a bootstrap argument, primarily employing the hyperboloidal foliation method and the vector field method.</description>
