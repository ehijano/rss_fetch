      <title>Production characteristics of light nuclei, hypertritons and $\Omega$-hypernuclei in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend an analytical nucleon coalescence model with hyperons to study productions of light nuclei, hypertritons and $\Omega$-hypernuclei in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We derive the formula of the momentum distribution of two bodies coalescing into dibaryon states and that of three bodies coalescing into tribaryon states. We explain the available data of the coalescence factors $B_2$ and $B_3$, the transverse momentum spectra, the averaged transverse momenta, the yield rapidity densities, yield ratios of the deuteron, antihelium-3, antitriton, hypertriton measured by the ALICE collaboration, and give predictions of different $\Omega$-hypernuclei, e.g., $H(p\Omega^-)$, $H(n\Omega^-)$ and $H(pn\Omega^-)$. We find two groups of interesting observables, the averaged transverse momentum ratios of light (hyper-)nuclei to protons (hyperons) and the centrality-dependent yield ratios of theirs. The former group exhibits a reverse-hierarchy of the nucleus size, and the latter is helpful for the judgements of the nucleus production mechanism as well as the nucleus own size.</description>

      <title>A Novel Model of Charged Leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel model of charged leptons is presented, which contains two basics hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the Yukawa coupling between Higgs field and charged leptons is the weak interaction, the Higgs field is a scalar intermediate boson which changes the chirality of charged leptons in the weak interaction. The other hypothesis is that the flavor eigenstates of charged leptons are the superposition states of left-handed and right-handed elementary Weyl spinors before the electroweak symmetry breaking. According to this model, the Yukawa coupling constants between Higgs field and three generations of charged leptons are considered to be a universal constant, and the difference of the masses of different charged leptons is due to the different left-right mixing angles of their flavor eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Renormalization, Decoupling and the Hierarchy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hierarchy problem is associated with the renormalization and decoupling. By the decoupling of heavy fields, we can account for the smallness of the scalar mass against loop corrections and its insensitivity to ultraviolet physics. It is essential to correctly identify the observable parameters, which have natural convergence properties, as opposed to the bare ones. The loop corrections are finite and perturbatively expandable order by order. They are suppressed as powers of the external momentum to the mass ratio, according to the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem which we complete for the case of the scalar mass.</description>

      <title>On the Validity of Bounds on Light Axions for $f\lesssim10^{15}$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light bosonic dark matter fields that can be treated like a classical wave have non-linear field values close to massive bodies. Here we make the important observation that the quadratic interactions of axion dark matter lead to a divergence of the axion field value resulting in a non-physical parameter space for values of the decay constant of $f\lesssim 10^{15}$ GeV. We identify experimental observables impacted by this effect and those that can avoid it.</description>

      <title>Axion Bounds from Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consistent treatment of the quantum field theory of an axion-like particle (ALP) interacting with Standard Model fields requires to account for renormalisation group running and matching to the low-energy theory. Quantum sensor experiments designed to search for very light ALPs are particularly sensitive to these effects because they probe large values of the decay constant for which running effects become important. In addition, while linear axion interactions are set by its pseudoscalar nature, quadratic interactions are indistinguishable from quadratic interactions of scalars. We show how the Wilson coefficients of linear and quadratic axion interactions are related, including running effects above and below the QCD scale and provide a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of current and future experiments. We identify the reach of different experiments for the case of ALP dark matter and comment on how it could be distinguished from the case where it is not the dark matter. We present novel search strategies to observe quadratic ALP interactions via fifth force searches, haloscopes, helioscopes and quantum sensors. We emphasize the nonlinear behaviour of the ALP field close to the surface of the earth and point out which experimental results can be trusted in a regime where the ALP background field has unphysical values.</description>

      <title>Model-independent search for T violation with T2HK and DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time reversal (T) transformation in neutrino oscillations in a model-independent way by comparing the observed transition probabilities at two different baselines at the same neutrino energy. We show that, under modest model assumptions, if the transition probability $P_{\nu_\mu\to\nu_e}$ around $E_\nu \simeq 0.86$ GeV measured at DUNE is smaller than the one at T2HK the T symmetry has to be violated. Experimental requirements needed to achieve good sensitivity to this test for T violation are to obtain enough statistics at DUNE for $E_\nu \lesssim 1$ GeV (around the 2nd oscillation maximum), good energy resolution (better than 10%), and near-detector measurements with a precision of order 1% or better.</description>

      <title>On the length scale of collective neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I present a discussion on the length scale of collective neutrino oscillations. There is a popular myth in the field that the length scale of collective neutrino oscillation is related to the strength of self-interaction potential; this is a result of confusion between the length scale and time scale. As a consequence of this myth, it is believed that the convergence of numerical simulation of quantum kinetic equations requires a spatial resolution (radial bin size) that is equal to the inverse of the self-interaction potential. I try to debunk this myth in this paper.</description>

      <title>Semi-automatic Calculations of Multi-loop Feynman Amplitudes with AmpRed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Mathematica package AmpRed for the semi-automatic calculations of multi-loop Feynman amplitudes with high efficiency and precision. AmpRed implements the methods of integration by parts and differential equations in the Feynman-parameter representation. It allows for the calculations of general parametric integrals (which may not have momentum-space correspondences). Various user-friendly tools for multi-loop calculations, such as those to construct and solve differential equations for Feynman integrals, are provided. It can also deal with tensor algebras in non-relativistic field theories. Interfaces to some packages, like QGRAF and FOMR, are also provided.</description>

      <title>Final multiplicity of a QED cascade in generalized Heitler model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalized Heitler model for QED cascade. An exact formula for the final number of leptons is obtained by solving the kinetic equations. We demonstrate that in such a model the final number of leptons does not depend on photon and lepton free paths. We derive approximate formulas for the main characteristics of cascades at high energy, including the final number of leptons and the cascade depth. We show that in general the final number of leptons is asymptotically proportional to the energy of seed particle. It is also demonstrated how the original Heitler model is reproduced as a special case.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections relating leptoquark-fermion couplings probed at low and high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar leptoquarks (LQ) with masses between 2 TeV and 50 TeV are prime candidates to explain deviations between measurements and Standard-Model predictions in decay observables of $b$-flavored hadrons (``flavor anomalies''). Explanations of low-energy data often involve order-one LQ-quark-lepton Yukawa couplings, especially when collider bounds enforce a large LQ mass. This calls for the calculation of radiative corrections involving these couplings. Studying such corrections to LQ-mediated $b\to c\tau \nu$ and $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ amplitudes, we find that they can be absorbed into finite renormalizations of the LQ Yukawa couplings. If one wants to use Yukawa couplings extracted from low-energy data for the prediction of on-shell LQ decay rates, one must convert the low-energy couplings to their high-energy counterparts, which subsume the corrections to the on-shell LQ-quark-lepton vertex. We present compact formulae for these correction factors and find that in scenarios with $S_1$, $R_2$, or $S_3$ LQ the high-energy coupling is always smaller than the low-energy one, which weakens the impact of collider data on the determination of the allowed parameter spaces. For the $R_2$ scenario addressing $b\to c\tau \nu$, in which one of the two involved Yukawa coupling must be significantly larger than 1, we find this coupling reduced by 15\% at high energy. If both $S_1$ and $R_2$ are present, the high-energy coupling can also be larger and the size of the correction is unbounded, because tree contribution and vertex corrections involve different couplings. We further present the conversion formula to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme for the Yukawa couplings of the $S_3$ scenario.</description>

      <title>3-loop Feynman Integral Extrapolations for the Baseball Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on numerical techniques for expanding 3-loop Feynman integrals with respect to the dimensional regularization parameter $\varepsilon,$ which is related to the space-time dimension as $\nu = 4-2\varepsilon,$ and describes underlying UV singularities located at the boundaries of the integration domain. As a function of the squared momentum $s,$ the expansion coefficients exhibit thresholds that generally delineate regions for their computational techniques. For the problem at hand, a sequence of integrations with a linear extrapolation as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ may be performed to determine leading coefficients of the $\varepsilon$-expansion numerically. For the "baseball" Feynman diagram, we have used extrapolation with respect to an additional parameter to improve the accuracy of the $\varepsilon$-expansion coefficients in case of singularities internal to the domain.</description>

      <title>Resonant Forbidden CP Asymmetry from Soft Leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explain the baryon asymmetry in the early universe via leptogenesis, quantum corrections to new particles are commonly invoked to generate the necessary CP asymmetry. We demonstrate, however, that a large CP asymmetry can already arise from Standard Model leptons. The mechanism relies on resummation of soft leptons at finite temperatures. The CP asymmetry, which is kinetically forbidden in vacuum, can be resonantly enhanced from thermally resummed leptons by seven orders of magnitude. Contrary to the resonance from exotic particles, we show that the resonant enhancement from soft leptons is protected by controlled widths under finite-temperature perturbation theory. We quantify such CP asymmetries in leptogenesis with secluded flavor effects and comment on the significance and application. The mechanism exploits the maximal role of leptons themselves, featuring low-scale leptogenesis, minimal model buildings and dark matter cogenesis.</description>

      <title>Spin Alignment of Vector Mesons Induced by Local Spin Density Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism that the spin alignment of vector meson $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ in most central heavy ion collisions is induced by intrinsic QCD dynamics without external vortical/ magnetic fields. The local spin density fluctuation of quarks due to the axial-vector and tensor interactions between quarks can induce the spin alignments of vector meson. It is found that axial-vector interaction results in $\rho_{00}&lt;1/3$ for the spin alignment of $\phi$ meson, while tensor interaction results in $\rho_{00}&gt;1/3$. We argue that the spin alignment of $K^{*0}$ due to the spin density fluctuation from flavor-mixing would be a signature or hint of instanton.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD Axions in light of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion stands as one of the most promising candidates for resolving the strong CP problem. However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to an anthropic abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the leading-twist gluonic distribution functions within the proton by formulating a light-front spectator model. The proton light-front wave functions (LFWFs) are adopted from the soft-wall AdS/QCD predictions, and the model parameters are determined using the gluon unpolarized parton distribution function from the NNPDF3.0nlo dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model calculations for gluon transverse momentum distributions (TMDs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs). We also predicted the gluon spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) contributions to the total proton spin.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group consistent treatment of color superconductivity in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called dSC phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis of excited glueball states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the determination for the spin-parity quantum numbers of the $X(2370)$ meson at BESIII, we extend our dispersive analysis on hadronic ground states to excited states. The idea is to start with the dispersion relation which a correlation function obeys, and subtract the known ground-state contribution from the involved spectral density. Solving the resultant dispersion relation as an inverse problem with available operator-product-expansion inputs, we extract excited-state masses from the subtracted spectral density. This formalism is verified by means of the application to the series of $\rho$ resonances, which establishes the $\rho(770)$, $\rho(1450)$ and $\rho(1700)$ mesons one by one under the sequential subtraction procedure. Our previous study has suggested the admixture of the $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$ mesons (the $\eta(1760)$ meson) to be the lightest scalar (pseudoscalar) glueball. The present work predicts that the $f_0(2200)$ ($X(2370)$) meson is the first excited scalar (pseudoscalar) glueball.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a comprehensive analysis of the mass spectrum and decay properties of charmonium states within a relativistic framework is carried out. The present experimental status of charmonium states is reviewed. Utilizing a screened potential model, we compute the spectra and various decay widths for $c\bar{c}$ bound system, comparing our results with experimental data and existing theoretical models. We calculate the decay constants, $E1$ and $M1$ transitions, and annihilation decay widths, confirming the consistency of our model with experimental observations for well-established charmonium states. The interpretation of charmonium-like states, $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, and $X(4500)$ as $P$ wave charmonium states and $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4230)$, $\psi(4360)$, $\psi(4415)$, $Y(4500)$ and $Y(4360)$ as $S-D$ mixed charmonium states are carried out.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections at subleading power for inclusive nonleptonic $b\rightarrow c\bar u d$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the NLO QCD corrections for the inclusive nonleptonic decay rates of $B$-hadrons at subleading power of the heavy quark expansion. In particular, we discuss the coefficient of the chromomagnetic moment parameter $\mu_G$ which has a large uncertainty at leading order due to its dependence on the renormalization scale. We find that the renormalization-scale dependence of this coefficient is significantly reduced, thereby reducing the theoretical uncertainty of the coefficient and consequently of the rates. The sign of the coefficient becomes stable, and we estimate that the NLO corrections will increase the decay rates by around $2\%$.</description>

      <title>Loop induced $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertices in the general two Higgs doublet model with CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding symmetry of extended Higgs models helps to construct the theory beyond the standard model and gives important insights for testing these models by experiments. The custodial symmetry plays an important role as a leading principle to construct non-minimal Higgs sectors. On the other hand, new sources of CP violation in the Higgs sector are essentially important to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In the two Higgs doublet model, it has been known that the CP violation and the custodial symmetry are not compatible, and thus the CP violating Higgs potential in general violates the custodial symmetry in the Higgs sector. In this paper, we discuss the loop-induced $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertices in the two Higgs doublet model, which are induced due to the custodial symmetry violation of the sector of the particles in the loop, and study how the vertices are affected by the CP violation. We calculate the $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertices in the most general two Higgs doublet model with the CP violation at the one-loop level and evaluate the decay modes $H^\pm \to W^\pm Z$ caused by these vertices. We obtain new contributions to the $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertices from the CP violating part of the model, in addition to the known contributions from the CP conserving part. Moreover, we find that an asymmetry between the decays $H^+ \to W^+ Z$ and $H^- \to W^- Z$ is caused by the CP violating phases in the model, some of which are important for the electroweak baryogenesis. We also briefly mention testability of these vertices at future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Pion to photon transition form factor: Beyond valence quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the singly virtual transition form factor (TFF) for the $\pi^0\to\gamma^*\gamma$ process in the space-like region using the hard-scattering formalism within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework. This form factor is expressed in terms of the perturbatively calculable hard-scattering amplitudes (HSAs) and the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion. We obtain the pion LFWFs by diagonalizing the light-front QCD Hamiltonian, which is determined for its constituent quark-antiquark and quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sectors with a three-dimensional confinement. We employ the HSAs up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the quark-antiquark Fock sector and leading order (LO) in the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector. The NLO correction to the TFF in the quark-antiquark Fock sector is of the same order as the LO contribution to the TFF in the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector. We find that while the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector has minimal effect in the large momentum transfer ($Q^2$) region, it has a noteworthy impact in the low-$Q^2$ region. Our results show that, after accounting for both Fock sectors, the TFF within the BLFQ framework aligns well with existing experimental data, particularly in the low $Q^2$ region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent updates in the xFitter software framework for global fits of parton distribution functions in high-energy physics. Our focus is on investigating the sensitivity to Z boson couplings using the forward-backward asymmetry in Drell-Yan production. By utilizing an effective approach and simulated data, we assess the accuracy of these couplings, specifically considering the full LHC data sample. Furthermore, we compare our results with predictions for future colliders, providing insights into their potential impact on understanding Z boson interactions.</description>

      <title>DarkMatters: A powerful tool for WIMPy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new software package, DarkMatters, which has been designed to facilitate the calculation of all aspects of indirect dark matter detection of WIMPs in astrophysical settings. Two primary features of this code are the improvement in performance compared to existing tools, and higher levels of accuracy when determining radio synchrotron emission associated with WIMP annihilations, both of which are enabled by the employment of a set of modern and novel numerical techniques. The code also includes functionality for a multi-wavelength set of output products including gamma-ray, radio and neutrino fluxes which can be saved in common formats used by the astronomical community, such as the FITS data file format. The calculations may be tailored to work with a wide range of astrophysical target structures, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, and the configuration of the underlying calculations is managed by a set of key-value dictionary entries that are easy to understand and use. The code base is publicly accessible through an online repository with a permissive MIT source code licence.</description>

      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>

      <title>Interpretating Pulsar Timing Array data of Gravitational Waves with Ekpyrosis-Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

      <title>The triton lifetime from nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a calculation of the triton $\beta$-decay lifetime using Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion. By incorporating a non-perturbative treatment of the higher-order corrections, we achieve consistent predictions for the Fermi and Gamow-Teller matrix elements, which are crucial for determining the triton lifetime. Our results are consistent with earlier theoretical calculations, confirming the robustness of our approach. This study marks a significant advancement in the systematic application of NLEFT to nuclear $\beta$-decay processes, paving the way for future high-precision calculations in more complex nuclear systems. Additionally, we discuss potential improvements to our approach, including the explicit inclusion of two-pion exchange mechanisms and the refinement of three-nucleon forces. These developments are essential for extending the applicability of NLEFT to a broader range of nuclear phenomena, including neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Search for $\eta_c(2S)\to\omega\omega$ and $\omega\phi$ decays and measurements of $\chi_{cJ}\to\omega\omega$ and $\omega\phi$ in $\psi(2S)$ radiative processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using $(2712\pm 14)$ $\times$ 10$^{6}$ $\psi(2S)$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we search for the decays $\eta_{c}(2S)\to\omega\omega$ and $\eta_{c}(2S)\to\omega\phi$ via the process $\psi(2S)\to\gamma\eta_{c}(2S)$. Evidence of $\eta_{c}(2S)\to\omega\omega$ is found with a statistical significance of $3.2\sigma$. The branching fraction is measured to be $\mathcal{B}(\eta_{c}(2S)\to\omega\omega)=(5.65\pm3.77(\rm stat.)\pm5.32(\rm syst.))\times10^{-4}$. No statistically significant signal is observed for the decay $\eta_{c}(2S)\to\omega\phi$. The upper limit of the branching fraction at the 90\% confidence level is determined to be $\mathcal{B}(\psi(2S)\to\gamma\eta_{c}(2S),\eta_{c}(2S)\to\omega\phi)&lt;2.24\times 10^{-7}$. We also update the branching fractions of $\chi_{cJ}\to \omega\omega$ and $\chi_{cJ}\to\omega\phi$ decays via the $\psi(2S)\to\gamma\chi_{cJ}$ transition. The branching fractions are determined to be $\mathcal{B}(\chi_{c0}\to\omega\omega)=(10.63\pm0.11\pm0.46)\times 10^{-4}$, $\mathcal{B}(\chi_{c1}\to\omega\omega)=(6.39\pm0.07\pm0.29)\times 10^{-4}$, $\mathcal{B}(\chi_{c2}\to\omega\omega)=(8.50\pm0.08\pm0.38)\times 10^{-4}$, $\mathcal{B}(\chi_{c0}\to\omega\phi)=(1.18\pm0.03\pm0.05)\times 10^{-4}$, $\mathcal{B}(\chi_{c1}\to\omega\phi)=(2.03\pm0.15\pm0.12)\times 10^{-5}$, and $\mathcal{B}(\chi_{c2}\to\omega\phi)=(9.37\pm1.07\pm0.59)\times 10^{-6}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic.</description>

      <title>Global Bases for Nonplanar Loop Integrands, Generalized Unitarity, and the Double Copy to All Loop Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method for defining a global loop-integrand basis for scattering amplitudes, encompassing both planar and nonplanar contributions. Our approach utilizes a graph-based framework to establish a well-defined, non-redundant basis of integrands. This basis, constructed from a chosen set of non-redundant graphs together with a selection of irreducible scalar products, provides clear insights into various physical properties of scattering amplitudes and proves useful in multiple contexts, such as on-shell Ward identities and manifesting gauge-choice independence. A key advantage of our integrand basis is its ability to streamline the generalized unitarity method. Specifically, we can directly read off the coefficients of basis elements without resorting to ansatze or solving linear equations. This novel approach allows us to lift generalized unitarity cuts -- expressed as products of tree amplitudes -- to loop-level integrands, facilitating the use of the tree-level double copy to generate complete gravitational integrands at any loop order. This method circumvents the difficulties in identifying complete higher-loop-order gauge-theory integrands that adhere to the color-kinematics duality. Additionally, our cut-based organization is well-suited for expansion in hard or soft limits, aiding in the exploration of ultraviolet or classical limits of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Nonexponential decay law of the 2P-1S transition of the H-atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate numerically the survival probability $P(t)$ for the unstable 2P excited state of the hydrogen atom, which decays into the ground-state 1S emitting one photon ($\tau \sim 1.595$ ns), thus extending the analytic study of Facchi and Pascazio, Physics Letters A 241 (1998). To this end, we first determine the analytic expression of the spectral function of the unstable state, which allows for an accurate evaluation of $P(t)$. As expected, for short and long times $P(t)$ shows deviations from the exponential law: a `Zeno' region occurs at extremely short times (up to $\sim 0.3$ attosec, followed by a longer `anti-Zeno' domain (up to $\sim 50$ attosec); at long times above $125 \tau$, the decay law scales as $t^{-4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological collider signals of primordial non-Gaussianity arise at tree level when an extra scalar has Hubble mass during inflation. We critically review the formalism finding that a large class of inflationary theories, based on Planck-scale physics, predict a scalar bi-spectrum around the gravitational floor level. This mild signal arises for example in $R^2$ gravity, in the regime where its gravitational scalar has Hubble-scale mass. Signals much above the gravitational floor arise in theories where scalars undergo multiple turns during inflation, thanks to sub-Planckian physics.</description>

      <title>Diffusion model approach to simulating electron-proton scattering events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI is a fast-growing area of research offering various avenues for exploration in high-energy nuclear physics. In this work, we explore the use of generative models for simulating electron-proton collisions relevant to experiments like CEBAF and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). These experiments play a critical role in advancing our understanding of nucleons and nuclei in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom. The use of generative models for simulating collider events faces several challenges such as the sparsity of the data, the presence of global or event-wide constraints, and steeply falling particle distributions. In this work, we focus on the implementation of diffusion models for the simulation of electron-proton scattering events at EIC energies. Our results demonstrate that diffusion models can accurately reproduce relevant observables such as momentum distributions and correlations of particles, momentum sum rules, and the leading electron kinematics, all of which are of particular interest in electron-proton collisions. Although the sampling process is relatively slow compared to other machine learning architectures, we find diffusion models can generate high-quality samples. We foresee various applications of our work including inference for nuclear structure, interpretable generative machine learning, and searches of physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Exploring SMEFT Couplings Using the Forward-Backward Asymmetry in Neutral Current Drell-Yan Production at the LHC</title>

Abstract: Neutral current Drell-Yan (DY) lepton-pair production is considered in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Using the open-source fit platform xFitter, we investigate the impact of high-statistics measurements of the neutral current DY (NCDY) forward-backward asymmetry $A_{\rm{FB}}$ near the weak boson mass scale in the present and forthcoming stages of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Besides recovering earlier results on the $A_{\rm{FB}}$ sensitivity to parton distribution functions, we analyze the precision determination of $Z$-boson couplings to left-handed and right-handed $u$-quarks and $d$-quarks, and explore Beyond-Standard-Model contributions using the SMEFT framework. We perform a sensitivity study and comment on the role of the $A_{\rm{FB}}$ asymmetry for the electroweak SMEFT fit and precision $Z$-boson physics at the LHC and high-luminosity HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Birefringence from CP-Violating Axion Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the cosmic birefringence signal produced by an ultralight axion field with a small CP-violating coupling to bulk SM matter in addition to the usual CP-preserving photon coupling. The change in the vacuum expectation value of the field between recombination and today results in a frequency-independent rotation of the plane of CMB linear polarization across the entire sky. While many previous approaches rely on the axion rolling from a large initial expectation value, the couplings considered in this work robustly generate the birefringence signal regardless of initial conditions, by sourcing the field from the cosmological nucleon density. We place bounds on such monopole-dipole interactions using measurements of the birefringence angle from Planck and WMAP data, which improve upon existing constraints by up to three orders of magnitude. We also discuss UV completions of this model, and possible strategies to avoid fine-tuning the axion mass.</description>

      <title>Sub-MeV Dark Matter Detection with Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The light dark matter mass regime has emerged as the next frontier in the direct detection experiment due to the lack of any detection signal in the higher mass range. In this paper, we propose a new detector material, a bilayer stack of graphene to detect sub-MeV dark matter. Its voltage-tunable low energy sub-eV electronic band gap makes it an excellent choice for the detector material of a light dark matter search experiment. We compute its dielectric function using the random phase approximation and estimate the projected sensitivity for sub-MeV dark matter-electron scattering and sub-eV dark matter absorption. We show that a bilayer graphene dark matter detector can have competitive sensitivity as other candidate target materials, like a superconductor, but with a tunable threshold energy in this mass regime. The dark matter scattering rate in bilayer graphene is also characterized by a daily modulation from the rotation of the Earth which may help us mitigate the backgrounds in a future experiment. We also outline a detector design concept and provide noise estimates that can be followed to setup an experiment in future.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the connection between the tribimaximal and bitrimaximal mixing patterns. In doing so, we are forced to work in a non-diagonal charged lepton basis. This leads to several relations that must hold between the lepton mixing angles. After a short discussion, we analyze the underlying flavor symmetry responsible for this prediction. Finally, we add CP violation to bitrimaximal mixing and study its effect on the flavor symmetry group.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of a Chiral Fermion Dark Matter Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories in which the dark matter (DM) candidate is a fermion transforming chirally under a gauge symmetry are attractive, as the gauge symmetry would protect the DM mass. In such theories, the universe would have undergone a phase transition at early times that generated the DM mass upon spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we explore the gravitational wave signals of a simple such theory based on an $\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{D}$ dark sector with a dark isospin-$3/2$ fermion serving as the DM candidate. This is arguably the simplest chiral theory possible. The scalar sector consists of a dark isospin-$3$ multiplet which breaks the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{D}$ gauge symmetry and also generates the DM mass. We construct the full thermal potential of the model and identify regions of parameter space which lead to detectable gravitational wave signals, arising from a strong first-order $\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{D}$ phase transition, in various planned space-based interferometers, while also being consistent with dark matter relic abundance. Bulk of the parameter space exhibiting detectable gravitational wave signals in the model also has large WIMP-nucleon scattering cross sections, $\sigma_{\rm SI}$, which could be probed in upcoming direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align} with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical uncertainties in dark matter direct detection experiments are typically addressed by parametrizing the velocity distribution in terms of a few uncertain parameters that vary around some central values. Here we propose a method to optimize over all velocity distributions lying within a given distance measure from a central distribution. We discretize the dark matter velocity distribution as a superposition of streams, and use a variety of information divergences to parametrize its uncertainties. With this, we bracket the limits on the dark matter-nucleon and dark matter-electron scattering cross sections, when the true dark matter velocity distribution deviates from the commonly assumed Maxwell-Boltzmann form. The methodology pursued is general and could be applied to other physics scenarios where a given physical observable depends on a function that is uncertain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the mixing of scalar and vector condensates produces spatially oscillating, but exponentially damped correlation functions in fermionic theories at finite density and temperature. We find a regime exhibiting this oscillatory behavior in a Gross-Neveu-type model that also features vector interactions within the mean-field approximation. The existence of this regime aligns with expectations based on symmetry arguments, that are also applicable to QCD at finite baryon density. We compute the phase diagram including both homogeneous phases and regions with spatially oscillating, exponentially damped correlation functions at finite temperature and chemical potential for different strengths of the vector coupling. Furthermore, we find that inhomogeneous condensates are disfavored compared to homogeneous ones akin to previous findings without vector interactions. We show that our results are valid for a broad class of $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional models with local four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: n proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions, the study of charm hadrons plays a pivotal role in understanding the QCD medium and provides an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interaction, as they are mostly produced in the early stages of collisions via hard partonic interactions. The lightest open-charm, $D^{0}$ meson ($c\Bar{u}$), can originate from two separate sources. The prompt $D^{0}$ originates from either direct charm production or the decay of excited open charm states, while the nonprompt stems from the decay of beauty hadrons. In this paper, using different machine learning (ML) algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest, an attempt has been made to segregate the prompt and nonprompt production modes of $D^{0}$ meson signal from its background. The ML models are trained using the invariant mass through its hadronic decay channel, i.e., $D^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+} K^{-}$, pseudoproper time, pseudoproper decay length, and distance of closest approach of $D^{0}$ meson, using PYTHIA8 simulated $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\rm{TeV}$. The ML models used in this analysis are found to retain the pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and collision energy dependence. In addition, we report the ratio of nonprompt to prompt $D^{0}$ yield, the self-normalized yield of prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$ and explore the charmonium, $J/\psi$ to open-charm, $D^{0}$ yield ratio as a function of transverse momenta and normalized multiplicity. The observables studied in this manuscript are well predicted by all the ML models compared to the simulation.</description>

Abstract: The Rivet toolkit is the primary mechanism for phenomenological preservation of collider-physics measurements, containing both a computational core and API for analysis implementation, and a large collection of more than a thousand preserved analyses. In this note we summarise the main changes in the new Rivet 4 major release series. These include a major generalisation and more semantically coherent model for histograms and related data objects, a thorough clean-up of inelegant and legacy observable-computation tools, and new systems for extended analysis-data, incorporation of preserved machine-learning models, and serialization for high-performance computing applications. Where these changes introduce backward-incompatible interface changes, existing analyses have been updated and indications are given on how to update new analysis routines and workflows.</description>

      <title>Top-down and bottom-up: Studying the SMEFT beyond leading order in $1/\Lambda^2$</title>

Abstract: In order to assess the relevance of higher order terms in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) expansion we consider four new physics models and their impact on the Drell Yan cross section. Of these four, one scalar model has no effect on Drell Yan, a model of fermions while appearing to generate a momentum expansion actually belongs to the vacuum expectation value expansion and so has a nominal effect on the process. The remaining two, a leptoquark and a Z' model exhibit a momentum expansion. After matching these models to dimension-ten we study how the inclusion of dimension-eight and dimension-ten operators in hypothetical effective field theory fits to the full ultraviolet models impacts fits. We do this both in the top-down approach, and in a very limited approximation to the bottom up approach of the SMEFT to infer the impact of a fully general fit to the SMEFT. We find that for the more weakly coupled models a strictly dimension-six fit is sufficient. In contrast when stronger interactions or lighter masses are considered the inclusion of dimension-eight operators becomes necessary. However, their Wilson coefficients perform the role of nuisance parameters with best fit values which can differ statistically from the theory prediction. In the most strongly coupled theories considered (which are already ruled out by data) the inclusion of dimension-ten operators allows for the measurement of dimension-eight operator coefficients consistent with theory predictions and the dimension-ten operator coefficients then behave as nuisance parameters. We also study the impact of the inclusion of partial next order results, such as dimension-six squared contributions, and find that in some cases they improve the convergence of the series while in others they hinder it.</description>

      <title>Reopening the Z portal with semi-annihilations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In one-component dark matter (DM) scenarios is commonly assumed that a scalar WIMP must either be part of an $SU(2)_L$ multiplet with zero hypercharge or have suppressed vector interactions with the $Z$ gauge boson to circumvent stringent direct detection (DD) bounds. In this work, we demonstrate that multi-component scenarios with a dark scalar doublet exhibiting vector-like interactions with the $Z$ boson are also compatible with bounds arising from DD searches. Specifically, we consider a simple extension of the Standard Model wherein the dark sector comprises a doublet and a complex singlet $\phi$, both charged under a $Z_6$ symmetry. We find that semi-annihilation processes drastically reduce the relic abundance of the neutral component of the doublet, $H^0$, sufficiently attenuating the effects of its large $Z$-mediated elastic scattering cross-section with nucleons to satisfy the DD constraints. Although the contribution of $H^0$ to the total relic abundance is nearly negligible, with $\phi$ dominating, both dark matter components are expected to be detectable in ongoing and future DD experiments. The viability of the model is tested against several theoretical and experimental constraints, resulting in a parameter space featuring a non-degenerate mass spectrum at the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>Dark Neutrino Moments From Light Loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active and sterile neutrinos may acquire "dark moments" via one-loop diagrams with a massless dark photon and new light particles in the loop. Due to the kinetic mixing between the dark photon and the Standard Model photon, neutrinos would obtain effective electromagnetic moments. This mechanism allows for enhanced electromagnetic moments that can evade constraints on particles directly charged under electromagnetism. We show that in a wide region of parameter space, the model features testable predictions for the anapole and magnetic moment of active and sterile neutrinos with dark matter direct detection experiments sensitive to the solar neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>$X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ in process $B^+\to D^+ D^- K^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the nature of the $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ based on experimental results of the process $B^+$$\to$$D^+ D^- K^+$. We focus on the S-wave $D^{*-}K^{*+}$ and $D_s^+D_s^-$ molecular states, which can be related to the $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$, respectively. Using effective Lagrangians, we construct the potential kernel of the $D^{*-}K^{*+}$$-$$D^{-}K^{+}$ and $D_s^+D_s^-$$-$$D^+D^-$ interactions with a one-boson-exchange model, and determine the scattering amplitudes and their poles through a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. By incorporating the potential kernel into the three-body decay process $B^+$$\to$$D^+ D^- K^+$, we evaluate the $D^-K^+$ and $D^+D^-$ invariant mass spectra, as well as the Dalitz plot, with Monte Carlo simulation. A satisfactory fit to the $D^-K^+$ and $D^+D^-$ invariant mass spectra is achieved after introducing additional Breit-Wigner resonances, the $X_1(2900)$, $\psi(3770)$, and $\chi_{c2}(3930)$ states. Prominent signals of the $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ states appear as peaks in the $D^-K^+$ and $D^+D^-$ invariant mass spectra near 2900 and 3930 MeV, respectively. Clear event concentration of the $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_0(3930)$ states is evident as strips in the Dalitz plot. The results suggest that both $X_0(2900)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ can be interpreted as molecular states, with the inclusion of $X_1(2900)$ and $\chi_2(3930)$ necessary to describe structures in the regions near 2900 and 3930 MeV.</description>

      <title>The case for adopting the sequential Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm in neutrino oscillation physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor oscillations and conversion in an interacting background (MSW effects) may reveal the charge-parity violation in the next generation of neutrino experiments. The usual approach for studying these effects is to numerically integrate the Schrodinger equation, recovering the neutrino mixing matrix and its parameters from the solution. This work suggests using the classical Jacobi's diagonalization in combination with a reordering procedure to produce a new algorithm, the Sequential Jacobi Diagonalization. This strategy separates linear algebra operations from numerical integration, allowing physicists to study how the oscillation parameters are affected by adiabatic MSW effects in a more efficient way. The mixing matrices at every point of a given parameter space can be stored for speeding up other calculations, such as model fitting and Monte Carlo productions. This approach has two major computation advantages, namely: being trivially parallelizable, making it a suitable choice for concurrent computation, and allowing for quasi-model-independent solutions that simplify Beyond Standard Model searches.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimension and quasinormal modes of flavor branes</title>

Abstract: We study scalar quasinormal modes in a D3/D7 system holographically dual to a quantum field theory with chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature. From the bottom-up approach, we consider a nontrivial dilaton profile which is responsible for the anomalous dimension of the quark condensate. It depends on a new parameter$ q$ in the model. By varying this parameter, we study the behavior of the massive and massless scalar quasinormal modes. The numerical method that we use is the spectral method, and we find that there is no pure imaginary mode for the massless case but it appears by increasing the parameter $q$. It is known that this mode becomes tachyonic for massive cases. Then we turn on a pseudoscalar field and using a simple ansatz study its effect on the quasinormal modes of the scalar field. By varying the parameter of the nontrivial dilaton profile in the model, we qualitatively study quasinormal modes in walking theories.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Gravitational Lensing Map and Cosmological Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from a gravitational lensing mass map covering 9400 sq. deg. reconstructed from CMB measurements made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021. In combination with BAO measurements (from SDSS and 6dF), we obtain the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8 = 0.819 \pm 0.015$ at 1.8% precision, $S_8\equiv\sigma_8({\Omega_{\rm m}}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.840\pm0.028$ and the Hubble constant $H_0= (68.3 \pm 1.1)\, \text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 1.6% precision. A joint constraint with CMB lensing measured by the Planck satellite yields even more precise values: $\sigma_8 = 0.812 \pm 0.013$, $S_8\equiv\sigma_8({\Omega_{\rm m}}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.831\pm0.023$ and $H_0= (68.1 \pm 1.0)\, \text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. These measurements agree well with $\Lambda$CDM-model extrapolations from the CMB anisotropies measured by Planck. To compare these constraints to those from the KiDS, DES, and HSC galaxy surveys, we revisit those data sets with a uniform set of assumptions, and find $S_8$ from all three surveys are lower than that from ACT+Planck lensing by varying levels ranging from 1.7-2.1$\sigma$. These results motivate further measurements and comparison, not just between the CMB anisotropies and galaxy lensing, but also between CMB lensing probing $z\sim 0.5-5$ on mostly-linear scales and galaxy lensing at $z\sim 0.5$ on smaller scales. We combine our CMB lensing measurements with CMB anisotropies to constrain extensions of $\Lambda$CDM, limiting the sum of the neutrino masses to $\sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.13$ eV (95% c.l.), for example. Our results provide independent confirmation that the universe is spatially flat, conforms with general relativity, and is described remarkably well by the $\Lambda$CDM model, while paving a promising path for neutrino physics with gravitational lensing from upcoming ground-based CMB surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that electric fields in compactified spaces may produce Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles even when the energy of electric fields is smaller than KK scale. As an illustrating example, we consider a charged massless complex scalar coupled to U(1) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times {\mathbb S}^1$ and discuss the effect of background gauge potential along a compact direction. The electric field produces the charged Kaluza-Klein particle non-perturbatively, which we call KK Schwinger effect. We quantitatively show that KK modes can be produced even when the electric field energy is much below the KK scale. The mechanism is rather general and similar phenomena would occur in any compactification models when a gauge potential along compact direction evolves in time and experiences large enough field excursion. We also discuss the subtlety of four dimensional effective theory truncated by KK modes at an initial time, when the electric field is turned on.</description>

      <title>Investigating the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger observations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>
