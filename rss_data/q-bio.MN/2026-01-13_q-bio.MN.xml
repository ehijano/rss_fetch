      <title>In-context learning emerges in chemical reaction networks without attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether chemical processes can perform in-context learning (ICL), a mode of computation typically associated with transformer architectures. ICL allows a system to infer task-specific rules from a sequence of examples without relying solely on fixed parameters. Traditional ICL relies on a pairwise attention mechanism which is not obviously implementable in chemical systems. However, we show theoretically and numerically that chemical processes can achieve ICL through a mechanism we call subspace projection, in which the entire input vector is mapped onto comparison subspaces, with the dominant projection determining the computational output. We illustrate this mechanism analytically in small chemical systems and show numerically that performance is robust to input encoding and dynamical choices, with the number of tunable degrees of freedom in the input encoding as a key limitation. Our results provide a blueprint for realizing ICL in chemical or other physical media and suggest new directions for designing adaptive synthetic chemical systems and understanding possible biological computation in cells.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of Euler characteristic of finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>

      <title>PLANET v2.0: A comprehensive Protein-Ligand Affinity Prediction Model Based on Mixture Density Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery represents a time-consuming and financially intensive process, and virtual screening can accelerate it. Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows. PLANET v2.0 is freely available at https://www.pdbbind-plus.org.cn/planetv2.</description>
