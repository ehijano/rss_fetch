      <title>Study of the Log-third-difference method for the computation of even-odd staggering in fission yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The even-odd staggering in fission fragments yield distributions is an important observable to address the role of intrinsic excitations in the fission process. However, its computation as a function of the fragment split is an ill-posed problem that is usually solved through certain assumptions. Arguably, the most widely used method for its computation is the Log-third-difference method, which assumes an underlying local Gaussian distribution. Experimental data of the even-odd effect show sharp features and peaks that are a challenge for the Log-third difference method (or any method for that matter). This paper presents a detailed study of the performance of the Log-third difference method and describes three strategies for improving the precision and accuracy around these sharp features. The best results are obtained with an iterative application of the method and with the use of a multi-Gaussian fit. In regions with a smooth behaviour, the direct application of the Log-third-difference method remains the best option.</description>

      <title>Pions valence quark distributions in asymmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have calculated the valence quark distributions of the lightest pseudoscalar meson, pions, in the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero and finite temperature employing a light-cone quark model. The medium modifications in the pion properties have been stimulated through the effective quark masses computed using the chiral SU($3$) quark mean field model. We have primarily focused on the impact of isospin asymmetric medium on the distribution amplitudes (DAs) and parton distribution functions (PDFs) of a valence quark for different baryon density and temperature values. Also, the DAs and PDFs have been evolved to $Q^2=10$ GeV$^2$ and $Q^2=16$ GeV$^2$ for different densities of nuclear medium and results have been compared with the available experimental data. The DAs and PDFs are found to modify substantially as a function of baryon density as compared to temperature and isospin asymmetry of the medium.</description>

      <title>Survival Probabilities of Compound Superheavy Nuclei Towards Element 119</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To synthesize superheavy element 119 is becoming highly concerned as several experimental projects in major laboratories are being pursued. This work studied the survival probabilities of compound superheavy nuclei after multiple neutron emissions based on microscopic energy dependent fission barriers, demonstrating a significant role of triaxial deformation in decreasing the first fission barriers in the heaviest region. Together with the fusion cross sections by the dinuclear system model, the optimal energy and the residual cross section of $^{243}$Am($^{48}$Ca, 3$n$)$^{288}$Mc are reproduced. Finally the cross sections and optimal beam energies of $^{243}$Am+$^{54}$Cr and $^{249}$Bk+$^{50}$Ti reactions are estimated, providing clues for the synthesis of new elements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement in Nuclear Fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fission presents a unique example of quantum entanglement in strongly interacting many-body systems. A heavy nucleus can split into hundreds of combinations of two complementary fragments in the fission process. The entanglement of fragment wave functions is persistent even after separation and impacts the partition of particles and energies between fragments. Based on microscopic dynamical calculations of the fission of $^{240}$Pu, this work finds that quantum entanglement is indispensable in the appearance of sawtooth distributions of average excitation energies of fragments and thus neutron multiplicities, but not in average neuron excess of fragments. Both sawtooth slopes from particle-number projections are found to be steep -- a feature which can be alleviated by random fluctuations. These findings may impact the understanding of quantum entanglement more broadly in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Anti-flow of Mesons in the High Baryon Density Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The E895 and STAR experiments demonstrate that the slopes of directed flow with respect to rapidity ($dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$) of mesons are negative in the low transverse momentum ($p_T$) region, $p_T &lt; 0.8$ GeV/$c$, in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0 - 3.9$ GeV. Using the transport model JAM, we investigate the directed flow of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $K^0$ as functions of rapidity, $p_T$, and collision energy in Au + Au collisions at the same energies as those in the E895 and STAR experiments. We find that the JAM model can qualitatively reproduce the anti-flow of $K^0_S$ observed in the E895 experiment. The $v_1$ slopes of pions and kaons are analyzed as functions of the $p_T$ window, revealing a strong $p_T$ dependence of the $v_1$ slopes. Negative $v_1$ slopes are observed in the low $p_T$ region, $p_T &lt; 0.8$ GeV/$c$, while positive slopes are shown in the higher $p_T$ region. We find that the shadowing effect from spectators is crucial in generating the anti-flow of mesons at low $p_T$ in the high baryon density region.</description>

      <title>A study of bound states of $\eta, \eta^{'}, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}$, $B^{0}$, $\bar{B^{0}}$, $\bar{K^{0}}$ and $\phi$ mesons with light and heavy nuclei within chiral SU(3) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the possibilities of the formation of bound states of neutral pseudoscalar mesons $\eta, \eta^{'}, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \bar{B^{0}}$ and $\bar{K^{0}}$ and the vector meson $\phi$, with the nuclei $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb, calculating their binding energy and absorption decay width. To calculate the optical potentials of these mesons in different nuclei under study, we shall use the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean field model, in which the properties of nucleons in the medium are modified through the scalar isoscalar fields $\sigma$ and $\zeta$ and the scalar-isovector field $\delta$. The scalar-isovector field $\delta$ account for the finite isospin asymmetry of different nuclei having asymmetry in number of protons and neutrons. The binding energy and absorption decay width of mesons are calculated for the ground state and some of possible excited states of the nuclei. In the chiral SU(3) model, the mesons $ \eta, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \bar{B^{0}}$ and $\bar{K^{0}}$ are observed to have significant negative mass shift upto nuclear saturation density which lead to the possibility of the bound states at least for ground states and some of excited states in case of heavy nuclei. For the pseudoscalar singlet $\eta^{'}$ and the vector meson $\phi$ the mass shift obtained are found to be small and bound states are not formed. The present calculations are compared with different studies available in the field and will be useful in understanding the outcomes from different experimental facilities focusing on this area of research.</description>

      <title>Testing for coherence and nonstandard neutrino interactions in COHERENT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze data from the CsI, liquid Ar and Ge detectors of the COHERENT experiment and confirm within $1.5\sigma$ that the measured elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section is proportional to the square of the number of neutrons in the nucleus, as expected for coherent scattering in the standard model. We also show how various degeneracies involving nonstandard neutrino interaction parameters are broken in a combined analysis of the three datasets.</description>

      <title>Are in-medium quark-gluon showers strongly coupled? Results in the large-$N_f$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inside a medium, showers originating from a very high energy particle develop via medium-induced splitting processes such as bremsstrahlung and pair production. During shower development, two consecutive splittings sometimes overlap quantum mechanically, so that they cannot be treated independently. Some of these effects can be absorbed into an effective value of a medium parameter known as $\hat q$. Previous calculations (with certain simplifying assumptions) have found that, after adjusting the value of $\hat q$, the leftover effect of overlapping splittings is quite small for purely gluonic large-$N_c$ showers but is very much larger for large-$N_f$ QED showers, at comparable values of $N\alpha$. Here, by investigating the same problem for QCD with *quarks* in the large-$N_f$ limit of many quark flavors, we make a first study of whether the small effect in purely gluonic showers (i) was merely an accident or (ii) is more broadly characteristic of such overlap effects in QCD. We also offer a qualitative explanation for the large size of the effect in QED vs. QCD.</description>

      <title>Search for baryon junctions in e+A collisions at the Electron Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constituent quarks in a nucleon are the essential elements in the standard ``quark model" associated with the electric charge, spin, mass, and baryon number of a nucleon. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a composite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea (anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are known to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In the early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis postulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis by measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions for $e$+($p$)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio between $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of proton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen and deuterium targets in $e+p$(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these measurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.</description>

      <title>Dihadron azimuthal asymmetry and light-quark dipole moments at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe light-quark dipole moments by examining the azimuthal asymmetries between a collinear pair of hadrons in semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering off an unpolarized proton target at the Electron-Ion Collider. These asymmetries provide a means to observe transversely polarized quarks, which arise exclusively from the interference between the dipole and the Standard Model interactions, thereby depending linearly on the dipole couplings. We demonstrate that this novel approach can enhance current constraints on light-quark dipole operators by an order of magnitude, free from contamination of other new physics effects. Furthermore, it allows for a simultaneous determination of both the real and imaginary parts of the dipole couplings, offering a new avenue for investigating potential $CP$-violating effects at high energies.</description>

      <title>Two-center harmonic oscillator basis for Skyrme-DFT calculations (I): formalism and Proof of Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12545v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to solve the nuclear density functional theory (DFT) equations using a two-center harmonic oscillator basis, incorporating pairing and Coulomb interactions. The goal is to efficiently determine the fission and fusion configurations in nuclei. The Coulomb exchange terms are evaluated exactly, allowing for a novel approach to neck formation without the Slater approximation, which has been commonly used in space coordinate-based approaches. The new method has been implemented in the code {\sc hfodd}, enabling direct comparison with standard one-center solutions. This first paper focuses on deriving and implementing a methodology based on stable, precise, and exact applications of harmonic oscillator bases for the two fragments, which can either overlap or be separated by arbitrarily large distances. The implementation is tested on two proof-of-principle examples using light nuclei, specifically $^8$Be and $^{24}$Mg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum and rearrangement decays of S-wave $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states in a simplified quark model. The masses and widths are estimated by assuming that the $X(4140)$ is the lower $1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. Comparing our results with experimental measurements, we find that the recently observed $X(3960)$ by LHCb can be assigned as the lowest $0^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state and the $X_0(4140)$ could be the second lowest $0^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. Predictions of ratios between partial widths for the involved tetraquarks are given. We call for searches for more $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquarks with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, $0^{++}$, and $2^{++}$.</description>

      <title>Pulse profile variability associated with the glitch of PSR J1048$-$5832</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PSR J1048$-$5832 (B1046$-$58) is a Vela-like pulsar that has exhibited multiple glitch events. In this study, we analyze the timing data spanning nearly 16 years, acquired from both the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Parkes 64 m radio telescope. As a result, a total of five glitches are detected within this dataset. Among them, a previously unknown small glitch is newly found at MJD 56985(9) (November 24, 2014), making it the smallest glitch recorded from this source so far. The increments of the spin frequency and its first derivative are $\Delta \nu \approx 2.2(3) \times 10^ {-8} $ Hz, and $\Delta \dot{\nu} \approx 3(2) \times 10^ {-15}$ s$^{-2}$, respectively. Significant changes in the integrated normalized mean pulse profile are detected following three of the five glitch events, notably in the radio band. Although no evidence of a correlation is found between the spin-down rate and profile evolution, the jump phenomenon of $W_{55}$ (pulse width at the 55% peak amplitude) after the glitch in the narrow mode suggests that the glitch may influence the profile change. We discuss the influence of glitches on the pulsar's emission properties in terms of platelet motion by a crustquake and also put constraints on the equation of state from the moment of inertia and response timescales of involved superfluid layers inside the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Charmonium states in a coupled-channel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the mass spectrum and two-body open-charm strong decays of charmonium states in a coupled-channel model where the $^3P_0$ quark-antiquark pair creation mechanism is employed. The results of masses, mass shifts, proportions of the $c\bar{c}$ component, and open-charm decay widths are provided. The $S$-$D$ wave mixing angles and di-electric decay widths for vector mesons are also presented. Based on our results, we find that the $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4360)$, and $\psi(4415)$ can be assigned as the $1^3D_1$-, $3^3S_1$-, $2^3D_1$-, $4^3S_1$-, and $3^3D_1$-dominated charmonium states, respectively. The $\psi_3(3842)$ is a good candidate of the $\psi_3(1D)$ charmonium state. The calculated mass and strong decay width of $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ with significant continuum contribution ($\sim$57\%) favor the charmonium interpretation for the mysterious $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. When considering the large uncertainty in the observed decay width, the possibility to assign the $\chi_{c0}(3860)$ as the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state cannot be ruled out. One may describe well the properties of $\chi_{c2}(3930)$ with the $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ charmonium. The predictions on properties of other $c\bar{c}$ states can be tested by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Collisional energy loss of a heavy quark in a semiquark-gluon plasma</title>

Abstract: By utilizing a background field effective theory, we compute the collisional energy loss of a heavy quark moving through a semiquark-gluon plasma characterized by nontrivial holonomy for Polyakov loops. We consider the elastic scatterings between the incident heavy quark and the thermal partons with both hard and soft momentum transfers. As compared to the energy loss obtained from the perturbation theory, the hard processes get modified through the thermal distribution functions that depend on the background field, while the proper treatment of the soft processes strongly relies on the use of the hard-thermal-loop resummed gluon propagator derived from the background field effective theory. Our results show that the heavy quark energy loss is significantly suppressed in the semiquark-gluon plasma due to a background field that is self-consistently generated in the effective theory. On the other hand, the suppression has a strong dependence on the temperature of the plasma which becomes negligible above $2 - 3 $ times the critical temperature. For a realistic coupling constant, ignoring a relatively weak dependence on the heavy quark velocity, the suppression on the collisional energy loss can be approximated by an overall factor determined solely by the background field. This simple conclusion is expected to be useful for phenomenological applications in the heavy flavor physics.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are intimately connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$ and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryon masses, we determine for the first time unambigously the trajectories of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point $(\mathrm{Tr}[M]=C)$ accurately. At $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV, our results are consistent with the lattice simulations, and the extrapolations to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral Lagrangians, agree well with existing experimental analyses. We predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, consistent with the LO interaction's dominance. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO, the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1583(5)(1)$ MeV, being dominantly a SU(3) singlet, while the higher pole belongs to the octet representation with a mass of $E^{(8)}=1585(8)(2)$ MeV. This can be tested in future LQCD simulations and experimental measurements.</description>
