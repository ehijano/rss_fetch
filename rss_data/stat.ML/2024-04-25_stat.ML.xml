      <title>Private Optimal Inventory Policy Learning for Feature-based Newsvendor with Unknown Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data-driven newsvendor problem with features has recently emerged as a significant area of research, driven by the proliferation of data across various sectors such as retail, supply chains, e-commerce, and healthcare. Given the sensitive nature of customer or organizational data often used in feature-based analysis, it is crucial to ensure individual privacy to uphold trust and confidence. Despite its importance, privacy preservation in the context of inventory planning remains unexplored. A key challenge is the nonsmoothness of the newsvendor loss function, which sets it apart from existing work on privacy-preserving algorithms in other settings. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate a privacy-preserving optimal inventory policy within the f-differential privacy framework, an extension of the classical $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy with several appealing properties. We develop a clipped noisy gradient descent algorithm based on convolution smoothing for optimal inventory estimation to simultaneously address three main challenges: (1) unknown demand distribution and nonsmooth loss function; (2) provable privacy guarantees for individual-level data; and (3) desirable statistical precision. We derive finite-sample high-probability bounds for optimal policy parameter estimation and regret analysis. By leveraging the structure of the newsvendor problem, we attain a faster excess population risk bound compared to that obtained from an indiscriminate application of existing results for general nonsmooth convex loss. Our bound aligns with that for strongly convex and smooth loss function. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed new method can achieve desirable privacy protection with a marginal increase in cost.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator induced Gaussian Process framework for probabilistic solution of parametric partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of neural operators has paved the way for the development of efficient approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) compared with traditional methods. However, most of the existing neural operators lack the capability to provide uncertainty measures for their predictions, a crucial aspect, especially in data-driven scenarios with limited available data. In this work, we propose a novel Neural Operator-induced Gaussian Process (NOGaP), which exploits the probabilistic characteristics of Gaussian Processes (GPs) while leveraging the learning prowess of operator learning. The proposed framework leads to improved prediction accuracy and offers a quantifiable measure of uncertainty. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated through experiments on various PDE examples, including Burger's equation, Darcy flow, non-homogeneous Poisson, and wave-advection equations. Furthermore, a comparative study with state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms is presented to highlight the advantages of NOGaP. The results demonstrate superior accuracy and expected uncertainty characteristics, suggesting the promising potential of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Heterogeneous Causal Inference Beyond Meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration between different data centers is often challenged by heterogeneity across sites. To account for the heterogeneity, the state-of-the-art method is to re-weight the covariate distributions in each site to match the distribution of the target population. Nevertheless, this method could easily fail when a certain site couldn't cover the entire population. Moreover, it still relies on the concept of traditional meta-analysis after adjusting for the distribution shift.
  In this work, we propose a collaborative inverse propensity score weighting estimator for causal inference with heterogeneous data. Instead of adjusting the distribution shift separately, we use weighted propensity score models to collaboratively adjust for the distribution shift. Our method shows significant improvements over the methods based on meta-analysis when heterogeneity increases. To account for the vulnerable density estimation, we further discuss the double machine method and show the possibility of using nonparametric density estimation with d&lt;8 and a flexible machine learning method to guarantee asymptotic normality. We propose a federated learning algorithm to collaboratively train the outcome model while preserving privacy. Using synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>Interpretable clustering with the Distinguishability criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster analysis is a popular unsupervised learning tool used in many disciplines to identify heterogeneous sub-populations within a sample. However, validating cluster analysis results and determining the number of clusters in a data set remains an outstanding problem. In this work, we present a global criterion called the Distinguishability criterion to quantify the separability of identified clusters and validate inferred cluster configurations. Our computational implementation of the Distinguishability criterion corresponds to the Bayes risk of a randomized classifier under the 0-1 loss. We propose a combined loss function-based computational framework that integrates the Distinguishability criterion with many commonly used clustering procedures, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and finite mixture models. We present these new algorithms as well as the results from comprehensive data analysis based on simulation studies and real data applications.</description>

      <title>Maximum Discrepancy Generative Regularization and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Single Channel Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of adversarial learning of regularization functionals has recently been introduced in the wider context of inverse problems. The intuition behind this method is the realization that it is not only necessary to learn the basic features that make up a class of signals one wants to represent, but also, or even more so, which features to avoid in the representation. In this paper, we will apply this approach to the training of generative models, leading to what we call Maximum Discrepancy Generative Regularization. In particular, we apply this to problem of source separation by means of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and present a new method for the adversarial training of NMF bases. We show in numerical experiments, both for image and audio separation, that this leads to a clear improvement of the reconstructed signals, in particular in the case where little or no strong supervision data is available.</description>

      <title>Time topological analysis of EEG using signature theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate signals is a task of paramount importance in many disciplines (epidemiology, finance, cognitive sciences and neurosciences, oncology, etc.). In this perspective, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a battery of "shape" invariants that can be exploited for the implementation of an effective detection scheme. Our contribution consists of extending the constructions presented in \cite{chretienleveraging} on the construction of simplicial complexes from the Signatures of signals and their predictive capacities, rather than the use of a generic distance as in \cite{petri2014homological}. Signature theory is a new theme in Machine Learning arXiv:1603.03788 stemming from recent work on the notions of Rough Paths developed by Terry Lyons and his team \cite{lyons2002system} based on the formalism introduced by Chen \cite{chen1957integration}. We explore in particular the detection of changes in topology, based on tracking the evolution of homological persistence and the Betti numbers associated with the complex introduced in \cite{chretienleveraging}. We apply our tools for the analysis of brain signals such as EEG to detect precursor phenomena to epileptic seizures.</description>

      <title>Edge-Efficient Deep Learning Models for Automatic Modulation Classification: A Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement in deep learning (DL) for automatic modulation classification (AMC) of wireless signals has encouraged numerous possible applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, developing optimized DL models suitable for edge applications of wireless communications is yet to be studied in depth. In this work, we perform a thorough investigation of optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) developed for AMC using the three most commonly used model optimization techniques: a) pruning, b) quantization, and c) knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we have proposed optimized models with the combinations of these techniques to fuse the complementary optimization benefits. The performances of all the proposed methods are evaluated in terms of sparsity, storage compression for network parameters, and the effect on classification accuracy with a reduction in parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed individual and combined optimization techniques are highly effective for developing models with significantly less complexity while maintaining or even improving classification performance compared to the benchmark CNNs.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of Distilled and Pruned Deep Learning-based Wireless Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven deep learning (DL) techniques developed for automatic modulation classification (AMC) of wireless signals are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This poses a severe security threat to the DL-based wireless systems, specifically for edge applications of AMC. In this work, we address the joint problem of developing optimized DL models that are also robust against adversarial attacks. This enables efficient and reliable deployment of DL-based AMC on edge devices. We first propose two optimized models using knowledge distillation and network pruning, followed by a computationally efficient adversarial training process to improve the robustness. Experimental results on five white-box attacks show that the proposed optimized and adversarially trained models can achieve better robustness than the standard (unoptimized) model. The two optimized models also achieve higher accuracy on clean (unattacked) samples, which is essential for the reliability of DL-based solutions at edge applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</description>

      <title>Insufficient Statistics Perturbation: Stable Estimators for Private Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sample- and time-efficient differentially private algorithm for ordinary least squares, with error that depends linearly on the dimension and is independent of the condition number of $X^\top X$, where $X$ is the design matrix. All prior private algorithms for this task require either $d^{3/2}$ examples, error growing polynomially with the condition number, or exponential time. Our near-optimal accuracy guarantee holds for any dataset with bounded statistical leverage and bounded residuals. Technically, we build on the approach of Brown et al. (2023) for private mean estimation, adding scaled noise to a carefully designed stable nonprivate estimator of the empirical regression vector.</description>

      <title>The Power of Resets in Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulators are a pervasive tool in reinforcement learning, but most existing algorithms cannot efficiently exploit simulator access -- particularly in high-dimensional domains that require general function approximation. We explore the power of simulators through online reinforcement learning with {local simulator access} (or, local planning), an RL protocol where the agent is allowed to reset to previously observed states and follow their dynamics during training. We use local simulator access to unlock new statistical guarantees that were previously out of reach:
  - We show that MDPs with low coverability Xie et al. 2023 -- a general structural condition that subsumes Block MDPs and Low-Rank MDPs -- can be learned in a sample-efficient fashion with only $Q^{\star}$-realizability (realizability of the optimal state-value function); existing online RL algorithms require significantly stronger representation conditions.
  - As a consequence, we show that the notorious Exogenous Block MDP problem Efroni et al. 2022 is tractable under local simulator access.
  The results above are achieved through a computationally inefficient algorithm. We complement them with a more computationally efficient algorithm, RVFS (Recursive Value Function Search), which achieves provable sample complexity guarantees under a strengthened statistical assumption known as pushforward coverability. RVFS can be viewed as a principled, provable counterpart to a successful empirical paradigm that combines recursive search (e.g., MCTS) with value function approximation.</description>

      <title>Long-term Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short- and long-term outcomes of an algorithm often differ, with damaging downstream effects. A known example is a click-bait algorithm, which may increase short-term clicks but damage long-term user engagement. A possible solution to estimate the long-term outcome is to run an online experiment or A/B test for the potential algorithms, but it takes months or even longer to observe the long-term outcomes of interest, making the algorithm selection process unacceptably slow. This work thus studies the problem of feasibly yet accurately estimating the long-term outcome of an algorithm using only historical and short-term experiment data. Existing approaches to this problem either need a restrictive assumption about the short-term outcomes called surrogacy or cannot effectively use short-term outcomes, which is inefficient. Therefore, we propose a new framework called Long-term Off-Policy Evaluation (LOPE), which is based on reward function decomposition. LOPE works under a more relaxed assumption than surrogacy and effectively leverages short-term rewards to substantially reduce the variance. Synthetic experiments show that LOPE outperforms existing approaches particularly when surrogacy is severely violated and the long-term reward is noisy. In addition, real-world experiments on large-scale A/B test data collected on a music streaming platform show that LOPE can estimate the long-term outcome of actual algorithms more accurately than existing feasible methods.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Machine Unlearning with Counterfactual Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The right to be forgotten (RTBF) seeks to safeguard individuals from the enduring effects of their historical actions by implementing machine-learning techniques. These techniques facilitate the deletion of previously acquired knowledge without requiring extensive model retraining. However, they often overlook a critical issue: unlearning processes bias. This bias emerges from two main sources: (1) data-level bias, characterized by uneven data removal, and (2) algorithm-level bias, which leads to the contamination of the remaining dataset, thereby degrading model accuracy. In this work, we analyze the causal factors behind the unlearning process and mitigate biases at both data and algorithmic levels. Typically, we introduce an intervention-based approach, where knowledge to forget is erased with a debiased dataset. Besides, we guide the forgetting procedure by leveraging counterfactual examples, as they maintain semantic data consistency without hurting performance on the remaining dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing machine unlearning baselines on evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Prelimit Coupling and Steady-State Convergence of Constant-stepsize Nonsmooth Contractive SA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Q-learning, we study nonsmooth contractive stochastic approximation (SA) with constant stepsize. We focus on two important classes of dynamics: 1) nonsmooth contractive SA with additive noise, and 2) synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning, which features both additive and multiplicative noise. For both dynamics, we establish weak convergence of the iterates to a stationary limit distribution in Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we propose a prelimit coupling technique for establishing steady-state convergence and characterize the limit of the stationary distribution as the stepsize goes to zero. Using this result, we derive that the asymptotic bias of nonsmooth SA is proportional to the square root of the stepsize, which stands in sharp contrast to smooth SA. This bias characterization allows for the use of Richardson-Romberg extrapolation for bias reduction in nonsmooth SA.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Numeric SMC Sampling for Bayesian Nonlinear System Identification in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In engineering, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamic systems from data contaminated by noise is both essential and complex. Established Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, used for the Bayesian identification of these systems, facilitate the quantification of uncertainty in the parameter identification process. A significant challenge in this context is the numerical integration of continuous-time ordinary differential equations (ODEs), crucial for aligning theoretical models with discretely sampled data. This integration introduces additional numerical uncertainty, a factor that is often over looked. To address this issue, the field of probabilistic numerics combines numerical methods, such as numerical integration, with probabilistic modeling to offer a more comprehensive analysis of total uncertainty. By retaining the accuracy of classical deterministic methods, these probabilistic approaches offer a deeper understanding of the uncertainty inherent in the inference process. This paper demonstrates the application of a probabilistic numerical method for solving ODEs in the joint parameter-state identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. The presented approach efficiently identifies latent states and system parameters from noisy measurements. Simultaneously incorporating probabilistic solutions to the ODE in the identification challenge. The methodology's primary advantage lies in its capability to produce posterior distributions over system parameters, thereby representing the inherent uncertainties in both the data and the identification process.</description>

      <title>Spatial best linear unbiased prediction: A computational mathematics approach for high dimensional massive datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00285</link>

Abstract: With the advent of massive data sets much of the computational science and engineering community has moved toward data-intensive approaches in regression and classification. However, these present significant challenges due to increasing size, complexity and dimensionality of the problems. In particular, covariance matrices in many cases are numerically unstable and linear algebra shows that often such matrices cannot be inverted accurately on a finite precision computer. A common ad hoc approach to stabilizing a matrix is application of a so-called nugget. However, this can change the model and introduce error to the original solution. It is well known from numerical analysis that ill-conditioned matrices cannot be accurately inverted. In this paper we develop a multilevel computational method that scales well with the number of observations and dimensions. A multilevel basis is constructed adapted to a kD-tree partitioning of the observations. Numerically unstable covariance matrices with large condition numbers can be transformed into well conditioned multilevel ones without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is shown that the multilevel prediction exactly solves the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) and Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model, but is numerically stable. The multilevel method is tested on numerically unstable problems of up to 25 dimensions. Numerical results show speedups of up to 42,050 times for solving the BLUP problem, but with the same accuracy as the traditional iterative approach. For very ill-conditioned cases the speedup is infinite. In addition, decay estimates of the multilevel covariance matrices are derived based on high dimensional interpolation techniques from the field of numerical analysis. This work lies at the intersection of statistics, uncertainty quantification, high performance computing and computational applied mathematics.</description>

      <title>A Non-Expert's Introduction to Data Ethics for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07794v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. I then briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary and some closing remarks.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</description>

      <title>Multi-Study R-Learner for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Across Studies Using Statistical Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) is crucial for precision medicine. While multiple studies can improve the generalizability of results, leveraging them for estimation is statistically challenging. Existing approaches often assume identical HTEs across studies, but this may be violated due to various sources of between-study heterogeneity, including differences in study design, study populations, and data collection protocols, among others. To this end, we propose a framework for multi-study HTE estimation that accounts for between-study heterogeneity in the nuisance functions and treatment effects. Our approach, the multi-study R-learner, extends the R-learner to obtain principled statistical estimation with machine learning (ML) in the multi-study setting. It involves a data-adaptive objective function that links study-specific treatment effects with nuisance functions through membership probabilities, which enable information to be borrowed across potentially heterogeneous studies. The multi-study R-learner framework can combine data from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or a combination of both. It's easy to implement and flexible in its ability to incorporate ML for estimating HTEs, nuisance functions, and membership probabilities. In the series estimation framework, we show that the multi-study R-learner is asymptotically normal and more efficient than the R-learner when there is between-study heterogeneity in the propensity score model under homoscedasticity. We illustrate using cancer data that the proposed method performs favorably compared to existing approaches in the presence of between-study heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Anytime-valid t-tests and confidence sequences for Gaussian means with unknown variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1976, Lai constructed a nontrivial confidence sequence for the mean $\mu$ of a Gaussian distribution with unknown variance $\sigma^2$. Curiously, he employed both an improper (right Haar) mixture over $\sigma$ and an improper (flat) mixture over $\mu$. Here, we elaborate carefully on the details of his construction, which use generalized nonintegrable martingales and an extended Ville's inequality. While this does yield a sequential t-test, it does not yield an "e-process" (due to the nonintegrability of his martingale). In this paper, we develop two new e-processes and confidence sequences for the same setting: one is a test martingale in a reduced filtration, while the other is an e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained by swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right Haar mixture over $\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null, as done in universal inference. We also analyze the width of resulting confidence sequences, which have a curious polynomial dependence on the error probability $\alpha$ that we prove to be not only unavoidable, but (for universal inference) even better than the classical fixed-sample t-test. Numerical experiments are provided along the way to compare and contrast the various approaches, including some recent suboptimal ones.</description>

      <title>Free-form Flows: Make Any Architecture a Normalizing Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normalizing Flows are generative models that directly maximize the likelihood. Previously, the design of normalizing flows was largely constrained by the need for analytical invertibility. We overcome this constraint by a training procedure that uses an efficient estimator for the gradient of the change of variables formula. This enables any dimension-preserving neural network to serve as a generative model through maximum likelihood training. Our approach allows placing the emphasis on tailoring inductive biases precisely to the task at hand. Specifically, we achieve excellent results in molecule generation benchmarks utilizing $E(n)$-equivariant networks. Moreover, our method is competitive in an inverse problem benchmark, while employing off-the-shelf ResNet architectures.</description>

      <title>Multiclass Learning from Noisy Labels for Non-decomposable Performance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been much interest in recent years in learning good classifiers from data with noisy labels. Most work on learning from noisy labels has focused on standard loss-based performance measures. However, many machine learning problems require using non-decomposable performance measures which cannot be expressed as the expectation or sum of a loss on individual examples; these include for example the H-mean, Q-mean and G-mean in class imbalance settings, and the Micro $F_1$ in information retrieval. In this paper, we design algorithms to learn from noisy labels for two broad classes of multiclass non-decomposable performance measures, namely, monotonic convex and ratio-of-linear, which encompass all the above examples. Our work builds on the Frank-Wolfe and Bisection based methods of Narasimhan et al. (2015). In both cases, we develop noise-corrected versions of the algorithms under the widely studied family of class-conditional noise models. We provide regret (excess risk) bounds for our algorithms, establishing that even though they are trained on noisy data, they are Bayes consistent in the sense that their performance converges to the optimal performance w.r.t. the clean (non-noisy) distribution. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in handling label noise.</description>

      <title>Motion Code: Robust Time series Classification and Forecasting via Sparse Variational Multi-Stochastic Processes Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being extensively studied, time series classification and forecasting on noisy data remain highly difficult. The main challenges lie in finding suitable mathematical concepts to describe time series and effectively separating noise from the true signals. Instead of treating time series as a static vector or a data sequence as often seen in previous methods, we introduce a novel framework that considers each time series, not necessarily of fixed length, as a sample realization of a continuous-time stochastic process. Such mathematical model explicitly captures the data dependence across several timestamps and detects the hidden time-dependent signals from noise. However, since the underlying data is often composed of several distinct dynamics, modeling using a single stochastic process is not sufficient. To handle such settings, we first assign each dynamics a signature vector. We then propose the abstract concept of the most informative timestamps to infer a sparse approximation of the individual dynamics based on their assigned vectors. The final model, referred to as Motion Code, contains parameters that can fully capture different underlying dynamics in an integrated manner. This allows unmixing classification and generation of specific sub-type forecasting simultaneously. Extensive experiments on sensors and devices noisy time series data demonstrate Motion Code's competitiveness against time series classification and forecasting benchmarks.</description>

      <title>DeepFunction: Deep Metric Learning-based Imbalanced Classification for Diagnosing Threaded Pipe Connection Defects using Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern manufacturing, most of the product lines are conforming. Few products are nonconforming but with different defect types. The identification of defect types can help further root cause diagnosis of production lines. With the sensing development, signals of process variables can be collected in high resolution, which can be regarded as multichannel functional data. They have abundant information to characterize the process and help identify the defect types. Motivated by a real example from the pipe tightening process, we focus on defect classification where each sample is a multichannel functional data. However, the available samples for each defect type are limited and imbalanced. Moreover, the functions are incomplete since the pre-tightening process before the pipe tightening process is unobserved. To classify the defect samples based on imbalanced, multichannel, and incomplete functional data is very important but challenging. Thus, we propose an innovative classification framework based on deep metric learning using functional data (DeepFunction). The framework leverages the power of deep metric learning to train on imbalanced datasets. A neural network specially crafted for processing functional data is also proposed to handle multichannel and incomplete functional data. The results from a real-world case study demonstrate the superior accuracy of our framework when compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Weighted Moving Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exponentially weighted moving model (EWMM) for a vector time series fits a new data model each time period, based on an exponentially fading loss function on past observed data. The well known and widely used exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is a special case that estimates the mean using a square loss function. For quadratic loss functions EWMMs can be fit using a simple recursion that updates the parameters of a quadratic function. For other loss functions, the entire past history must be stored, and the fitting problem grows in size as time increases. We propose a general method for computing an approximation of EWMM, which requires storing only a window of a fixed number of past samples, and uses an additional quadratic term to approximate the loss associated with the data before the window. This approximate EWMM relies on convex optimization, and solves problems that do not grow with time. We compare the estimates produced by our approximation with the estimates from the exact EWMM method.</description>
