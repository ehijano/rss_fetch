      <title>Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Resistance and Quantum Hall Plateaus from Edge State Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the extensive literature on the quantum Hall effect (QHE), a direct derivation of the phenomenological formula $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2\nu$ from first principles has remained elusive. In this work, we revisit the Landau and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms and impose hard-wall boundary conditions on the wavefunction, an essential but often overlooked constraint. This condition quantizes the guiding center position and the longitudinal wave number $k_x$, leading naturally to a discrete number of edge states without invoking energy bending. We derive the Hall resistance directly and recover the standard result $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2\nu$, along with an explicit expression for the filling factor $\nu$ in terms of the Fermi energy and magnetic field. The resulting resistance steps reproduce the observed QHE plateaus and match experimental data without fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Spin Current Generation by Elastic Waves in $f$-wave Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the mechanism of spin current generation induced by elastic waves in nonrelativistic magnets referred to as altermagnets. By analyzing an $f$-wave altermagnet formed by a three-sublattice noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure breaking the spatial inversion symmetry on a two-dimensional triangular lattice within the linear response theory, we show that the nonrelativistic antisymmetric spin-split band structure can give rise to spin current generation when either longitudinal or transverse elastic wave is applied. We find that the momentum dependence of the antisymmetric spin splitting leads to a characteristic direction-dependent spin current response. We also compare the present nonrelativistic magnetic-order-driven mechanism with the relativistic one in a nonmagnetic Rashba system. These findings highlight the potential of invesion-symmetry-breaking altermagnets as a spin current generator driven by elasticity without relying on the relativistic spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>$\mu_\mathrm{2T}(n)$: A Method for Extracting the Density Dependent Mobility in Two-Terminal Nanodevices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring carrier mobility as a function of the carrier density in semiconductors using Hall effect is the gold standard for quantifying scattering mechanisms. However, for nanostructures, the Hall effect is not applicable, and the density dependence of mobility is generally inaccessible, rendering Hall effect measurements impractical. Here, we present $\mu_\mathrm{2T}(n)$, a new procedure allowing us to extract the density dependent mobility in two-terminal measured nano scale field effect transistors at zero magnetic field from conventional conductance vs gate voltage measurements. We validate $\mu_\mathrm{2T}$ against standard Hall measurements and then apply the procedure to 256 individual two-terminal InAs nanowire FETs, extracting information about the scattering mechanisms. To illustrate its broad utility, we reanalyze published data in which mobility had been treated as density independent. Our method represents a new powerful tool for optimization and development of nanomaterials crucial for a wide range of new technologies.</description>

      <title>Finite Length Effects and Coulomb Interaction in Ge Quantum Well-Based Josephson Junctions Probed with Microwave Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximitized Ge quantum wells have emerged as a novel platform for studying Andreev bound states (ABSs), due to their expected strong spin-orbit interaction and high mobility. Here, we used microwave spectroscopy techniques to investigate ABSs in Josephson junctions (JJs) realized in proximitized Ge quantum wells. Spectroscopic signatures observed in a 350 nm junction indicated the presence of multiple ABSs, and were reproduced with a model including finite-length effects. The ABS spectra measured for a $1.2~\mu$m junction were explained by a model including three ABSs in two conduction channels and finite Coulomb interaction. Our work highlights the importance of interactions in JJs and serves as a basis for understanding and manipulating ABSs in Ge-based hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Gate reflectometry in a minimal Kitaev chain device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum dot (QD)-superconductor system can be used to realize Majorana zero modes in artificial Kitaev chains. These chains provide a promising platform for the realization of Majorana qubits. Radio-frequency (RF) gate reflectometry is a fast, non-invasive, and sensitive technique that can be used to read out such qubits. In this work, we use gate reflectometry to probe two QDs coupled via a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid segment. We demonstrate that gate sensing can resolve charge stability diagrams and clearly distinguish between elastic cotunneling and crossed-Andreev reflection, the two key processes that allow one to form a Kitaev chain. Furthermore, we show that this information is accessible, even when the system is completely decoupled from the from the normal leads. In this closed regime, we show that the observed quantum capacitance signal is indicative of parity switching between the even and odd ground states. Our measurements in both open and closed regimes confirm that gate reflectometry captures the essential features of interdot coupling and parity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of momentum dependent charge density wave gap in EuTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of charge density wave (CDW) phenomena, particularly in low dimensional rare-earth chalcogenides, has attracted substantial research interest. Among these materials, EuTe4, which features multiple Te layers and a single Eu-Te layer, serves as a promising platform to study the interplay between CDW order and 4f electron configurations, including magnetism. In this study, First principles based density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to investigate the electronic band structure modifications arising from CDW modulation. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) revealed the emergence of a CDW gap at the Fermi level, as well as hybridization induced gap features at lower binding energies. The low lying CDW gap reaches its maximum along the Gamma-Y high-symmetry direction and a minimum along GX reflecting the anisotropic nature of the electronic structure. We also performed low temperature heat capacity measurements in applied magnetic fields near the Neel temperature (TN ~ 6.9 K) to construct the magnetic phase diagram of EuTe4. This study provides valuable insight into the directional dependent evolution of the Fermi surface nesting induced CDW ordering, along with other observed gap openings within this system.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator with photonic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet non-Abelian topological phases emerge in periodically driven systems and exhibit properties that are absent in their Abelian or static counterparts. Dubbed the Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNATIs), they are characterized by non-Abelian topological charges and feature multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, making their experimental observation challenging. Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic quantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key signatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection for the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved injection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the anomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite the presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first experimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the non-Abelian topological phases.</description>

      <title>Spin-resolved Josephson diode effect through strongly spin-polarized conical magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the spin-resolved Josephson diode effect in junctions comprising strongly spin-polarized conical magnets (FM) coupled to singlet superconductors (SC). The system is treated by making use of the Gor$^\prime$kov and quasiclassical Green$^\prime$s function methods. Modeling the SC/FM interfaces as spin-dependent $\delta$-potentials, we apply our model to an SC/FM/SC junction and account for the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR). The nontrivial coupling between the spin bands in the conical magnet gives rise to a strong Josephson diode effect with an efficiency greater than 40%. The effect essentially depends on the quantum spin-geometric phase that enters the Josephson CPR in a very similar manner to the superconducting phase difference. The former is generated non-locally by the intrinsically noncoplanar spin arrangement of the conical magnet, which breaks the time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Strong spin polarization and a helical pitch of the conical magnet comparable to the superconducting coherence length are essential for the effect. We perform a harmonic analysis of the Josephson CPR and interpret the effect in terms of coherent transfer of multiple equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs across the conical magnet.</description>

      <title>A spin-embedded diamond optomechanical resonator with mechanical quality factor exceeding one million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Critical Current Density in Josephson Junctions with Phase Non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we show that the standard Dynes-Fulton analysis, commonly used to reconstruct the critical current density from interference patterns, breaks down in Josephson junctions with nonlinear phase distributions, leading to non-physical artifacts. To address this, we developed a simple iterative reconstruction algorithm and validated it both numerically and experimentally using a planar Josephson junction model. Unlike conventional approaches based on the logarithmic Hilbert transform, the proposed method allows for incorporating prior knowledge about the system and addresses the fundamental issue of ambiguity in reconstructing the critical current density from interference patterns.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Magnetically Driven High-order Harmonic Generation in Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling behavior of high harmonic generation (HHG) driven by magnetic dynamics in spin-orbit coupled systems. In contrast to optically driven HHG--where the harmonic cutoff scales as $\omega^{-3}$ with the driving frequency $\omega$--our time-dependent quantum transport simulations reveal a qualitatively distinct scaling law for magnetically driven HHG in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction: the harmonic cutoff $n_{\mathrm{max}}$ scales as $\omega^{-1}$. This fundamental difference arises from distinct excitation mechanisms--namely, spin-flip transitions driven by vectorial magnetic precession, as opposed to scalar electric fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the precession cone angle $\theta$ serves as a crucial control parameter. Increasing $\theta$ broadens the harmonic bandwidth, with peak emission achieved for nearly in-plane magnetic dynamics. Our findings establish magnetically driven HHG as a robust and tunable mechanism for nonlinear spin transport, governed by unique scaling laws with potential applications in ultrafast spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Charge ordering and spontaneous topological Hall effect in bilayer skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion crystals with zero net skyrmion charge and zero topological Hall response are interesting candidate phases which can occur at a vanishing magnetic field in centrosymmetric systems. We study a minimal bilayer model of skyrmion crystals having opposite chirality and topological charge in the two layers, and show that it can host nearly flat electronic bands with quasi-uniform Berry curvature and quantum metric. Using Hartree-Fock theory, we show that weak to moderate short-range electron interactions induce two distinct types of symmetry breaking patterns depending on the band dispersion: an intra-unit-cell charge density modulation from Chern band mixing or a layer-imbalanced phase with a nonzero ferroelectric polarization. Both phases break inversion symmetry leading to a spontaneous and large net topological Hall effect, with the phase diagram tunable by external electric fields. Our results may be relevant to centrosymmetric skyrmion materials such as Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ as well as artificially engineered heterostructures. We also discuss its relation to recent work on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>Coulomb-driven Momentum Space Condensation in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems of strongly correlated electrons, the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking serves as a defining hallmark of the underlying many-body physics. Here, we report the discovery of an unprecedented emerging order in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, defined by the intertwinement of rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetry breaking. The link between these broken symmetries is uncovered through angle-resolved transport measurements. The spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry is identified by the Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature-dependent onset of transport anisotropy. Most remarkably, the nematic transition, defined by the cusp of transport anisotropy, coincides with the emergence of the anomalous Hall effect in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. Our findings provide unambiguous experimental evidence of spontaneous condensation in momentum space, a phenomenon previously proposed to arise from a Coulomb-driven flocking effect. Together, these observations establish electronic anisotropy as a fundamental organizing principle in the landscape of intertwined electronic orders in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: The nature of a superconductor is fundamentally determined by the symmetries broken in its order parameter. Here, we report an exceptionally exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene that simultaneously breaks rotational, translational, and time-reversal symmetries. We show that superconductivity emerges from a quarter-metallic state and is accompanied by the onset of stripe charge order. This unique intertwinement is revealed by angle-resolved transport measurements, which demonstrate dissipationless current confined to a single principal axis-forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels -- while the orthogonal direction remains resistive down to the lowest temperatures. The formation of stripe order is marked by a first-order melting transition, evidenced by pronounced thermal hysteresis upon warming and cooling. In addition, magnetic-field-induced switching between superconducting states -- reminiscent of behavior previously observed in rhombohedral tetra- and pentalayer graphene -- signals time-reversal symmetry breaking. Collectively, these observations reveal a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripe-ordered anomalous Hall state.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Majorana qubits by 1/f noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing, due to their promise of intrinsically low error rates enabled by topological protection. These error rates are expected to be suppressed exponentially with increasing nanowire length or decreasing temperature. Here we identify a fundamental decoherence mechanism that challenges this expectation. The high-frequency components of 1/f charge noise, ubiquitous in semiconductor devices, can excite quasiparticles in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which travel to the ends of the nanowire to poison the MZMs. This mechanism leads to qubit errors that grow with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the excitation rates for clean nanowires and show that this noise imposes a strict limit on the coherence times of the qubits currently being developed, reducing them to less than one microsecond even under ideal conditions. These timescales are significantly shorter than those required for gate operations, posing a serious obstacle to the scalability of Majorana-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to Weyl semimetals (WSMs), but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals: A Hyperspatial Projective Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase characterized by symmetry-protected, momentum-dependent spin splitting and collinear compensated magnetic moments, has thus far been explored primarily in periodic crystals. In this Letter, we extend the concept of altermagnetism to quasicrystals -- aperiodic systems with long-range order and noncrystallographic rotational symmetries. Using a hyperspatial projection framework, we construct decorated Ammann-Beenker and Penrose quasicrystalline lattices with inequivalent sublattices and investigate a Hubbard model with anisotropic hopping. We demonstrate that interaction-induced N\'eel order on such lattices gives rise to alternating spin-polarized spectral functions that reflect the underlying quasicrystalline symmetry, revealing the emergence of unconventional $g$-wave (octagonal) and $h$-wave (decagonal) altermagnetism. Our symmetry analysis and low-energy effective theory further reveal unconventional altermagnetic spin splitting, which is compatible with quasicrystalline rotational symmetry. Our work shows that quasicrystals provide a fertile ground for realizing unconventional altermagnetic phases beyond crystallographic constraints, offering a platform for novel magnetisms and transport phenomena unique to quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Skyrmion Qudit in a Triangular-lattice magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it became clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared to the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described by continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of quantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by the helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the limit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level system, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of the problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously introduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our solution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric field. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state is not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We constructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution in time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited further to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum skyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum qudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum qubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based resource theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum-impurity sensing of altermagnetic order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with individual spin defects has emerged as a versatile platform to probe microscopic properties of condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate that quantum relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can reveal the anisotropic spin dynamics of altermagnetic insulators together with their characteristic spin polarised bands. We show that the distance and orientation dependent relaxation rate of a nearby quantum impurity encodes signatures of momentum space anisotropy in the spin diffusion response, a hallmark of altermagnetic order. This directional sensitivity is unprecedented in the landscape of quantum materials sensing, and it enables the distinction of altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets via local, noninvasive measurements. Our results could spark new NV-sensing experiments on spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, and highlight the role of NV orientation to probe anisotropic phenomena in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Viewing protected superconducting qubits through the lens of the cat qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We describe cat-qubit-inspired bias-preserving $X$ and $CX$ gates for fluxonium. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced ultrafast structural transformations in thin Fe layer revealed by time-resolved X-ray diffraction</title>

Abstract: The ultrafast structural response of a thin iron film to sub-ps pulsed laser-induced heating has been investigated using time-resolved X-ray diffraction in the partial melting regime. A tetragonal distortion of the bcc-phase emerges at ~6 ps. Its formation is delayed relative to the initial heating (1-2 ps) and partial melting (2-5 ps) of the material, and controlled by the stress release in the quasi-instantaneously pressurized film. The distortion persists for at least 60 ps indicating the formation of a metastable bct phase between the equilibrium bcc and fcc phases.</description>
