      <title>Diffusion of knowledge and the lottery society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lucas-Moll system is a mean-field game type model describing the growth of an economy by means of
  diffusion of knowledge. The individual agents in the economy advance their knowledge by learning from each other and via internal innovation. Their cumulative distribution function satisfies a forward in time nonlinear non-local reaction-diffusion type equation. On the other hand, the learning strategy of the agents is based on the solution to a backward in time nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation that is coupled to the aforementioned equation for the agents density. Together, these equations form a system of the mean-field game type. When the learning rate is sufficiently large, existence of balanced growth path solutions to the Lucas-Moll system was proved in~\cite{PRV,Porretta-Rossi}. Here, we analyze a complementary regime where the balanced growth paths do not exist. The main result is a long time convergence theorem. Namely, the solution to the initial-terminal value problem behaves in such a way that at large times an overwhelming majority of the agents spend no time producing at all and are only learning. In particular, the agents density propagates at the Fisher-KPP speed. We name this type of solutions a lottery society.</description>

      <title>Local large deviations for randomly forced nonlinear wave equations with localized damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large deviation principle (LDP) for locally damped nonlinear wave equations perturbed by a bounded noise. When the noise is sufficiently non-degenerate, we establish the LDP for empirical distributions with lower bound of a local type. The primary challenge is the lack of compactness due to the absence of smoothing effect. This is overcome by exploiting the asymptotic compactness for the dynamics of waves, introducing the concept of asymptotic exponential tightness for random measures, and establishing a new LDP approach for random dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diffuse-interface model that describes the dynamics of nonhomogeneous incompressible two-phase viscous flows is investigated in a bounded smooth domain in ${\mathbb R}^3.$ The dynamics of the state variables is described by the nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system. We first give a blow-up criterion of local strong solution to the initial-boundary-value problem for the case of initial density away from zero. After establishing some key a priori with the help of the Landau Potential, we obtain the global existence and decay-in-time of strong solution, provided that the initial date $\|\nabla u_0\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}+\|\nabla \mu_0\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}+\rho_0$ is suitably small.</description>

      <title>An approximation of the squared Wasserstein distance and an application to Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a simple $C^{1,1}$ approximation of the squared Wasserstein distance on R^d when one of the two measures is fixed. This approximation converges locally uniformly. More importantly, at points where the differential of the squared Wasserstein distance exists, it attracts the differentials of the approximations at nearby points. Our method relies on the Hilbertian lifting of PL Lions and on the regularization in Hilbert spaces of Lasry and Lions. We then provide an application of this result by using it to establish a comparison principle for an Hamilton-Jacobi equation on the set of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Graph structure of the nodal set and bounds on the number of critical points of eigenfunctions on Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we illustrate and draw connections between the geometry of zero sets of eigenfunctions, graph theory, vanishing order of eigenfunctions, and unique continuation. We identify the nodal set of an eigenfunction of the Laplacian (with smooth potential) on a compact, orientable Riemannian manifold as an \emph{imbedded metric graph} and then use tools from elementary graph theory in order to estimate the number of critical points in the nodal set of the $k$-th eigenfunction and the sum of vanishing orders at critical points in terms of $k$ and the genus of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Steady compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with slip boundary conditions arising from kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the boundary value problem on the steady compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in a channel domain $(0,1)\times\mathbb{T}^2$ with a class of generalized slip boundary conditions that were systematically derived from the Boltzmann equation by Coron \cite{Coron-JSP-1989} and later by Aoki et al \cite{Aoki-Baranger-Hattori-Kosuge-Martalo-Mathiaud-Mieussens-JSP-2017}. We establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions in $(L_{0}^{2}\cap H^{2}(\Omega))\times V^{3}(\Omega)\times H^{3}(\Omega)$ provided that the wall temperature is near a positive constant. The proof relies on the construction of a new variational formulation for the corresponding linearized problem and employs a fixed point argument. The main difficulty arises from the interplay of velocity and temperature derivatives together with the effect of density dependence on the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce fractional weighted Sobolev spaces with degenerate weights. For these spaces we provide embeddings and Poincar\'e inequalities. When the order of fractional differentiability goes to $0$ or $1$, we recover the weighted Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces with Muckenhoupt weights, respectively. Moreover, we prove interior H\"older continuity and Harnack inequalities for solutions to the corresponding weighted nonlocal integro-differential equations. This naturally extends a classical result by Fabes, Kenig, and Serapioni to the nonlinear, nonlocal setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Kelvin-Voigt model for viscoelastic second-grade materials, where the elastic and the viscous stress tensor both satisfy frame indifference. Using a rigidity estimate by [Ciarlet-Mardare '15], existence of weak solutions is shown by means of a frame-indifferent time-discretization scheme. Further, the result includes viscous stress tensors which can be calculated by nonquadratic polynomial densities. Afterwards, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions in the case of small external loading and initial data. Our main tool is the abstract theory of metric gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Uniform resolvent estimates, smoothing effects and spectral stability for the Heisenberg sublaplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global bounds for solutions to stationary and time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations associated with the sublaplacian $\mathcal L$ on the Heisenberg group, as well as its pure fractional power $\mathcal L^s$ and conformally invariant fractional power $\mathcal L_s$. The main ingredient is a new abstract uniform weighted resolvent estimate which is proved by using the method of weakly conjugate operators -- a variant of Mourre's commutator method -- and Hardy's type inequalities on the Heisenberg group. As applications, we show Kato-type smoothing effects for the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, and spectral stability of the sublaplacian perturbed by complex-valued decaying potentials satisfying an explicit subordination condition. In the local case $s=1$, we obtain uniform estimates without any symmetry or derivative loss, which improve previous results.</description>

      <title>On some singularly perturbed elliptic systems modeling partial segregation, Part 1: uniform H\"older estimates and basic properties of the limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove uniform H\"older estimates in a class of singularly perturbed competition-diffusion elliptic systems, with the particular feature that the interactions between the components occur three by three (ternary interactions). These systems are associated to the minimization of Gross-Pitaevski energies modeling ternary mixture of ultracold gases and other multicomponent liquids and gases. We address the question whether this regularity holds uniformly throughout the approximation process up to the limiting profiles, answering positively. A very relevant feature of limiting profiles in this process is that they are only partially segregated, giving rise to new phenomena of geometric pattern formation and optimal regularity.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of solutions to a doubly degenerate chemotaxis-consumption system in two-dimensional setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work proceeds to consider the convergence of the solutions to the following doubly degenerate chemotaxis-consumption system \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\,}l@{\quad}l@{\,}c} &amp;u_{t}=\nabla\cdot\big(u^{m-1}v\nabla v\big)-\nabla\cdot\big(f(u)v\nabla v\big)+\ell uv,\\ &amp;v_{t}=\Delta v-uv, \end{array}\right.%} \end{align*} under no-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega\subset \R^2$, where the nonnegative function $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ is asked to satisfy $f(s)\le C_fs^{\al}$ with $\al, C_f&gt;0$ for all $s\ge 1$.
  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above system has been established in both one- and two-dimensional bounded convex domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a Harnack-type inequality in the two-dimensional case. In this note, we complement this result by using the Moser iteration technique and building a new Harnack-type inequality.</description>

Abstract: We prove an epiperimetric inequality for the thin obstacle Weiss' energy with odd frequencies and we apply it to solutions to the thin obstacle problem with general $C^{k,\gamma}$ obstacle. In particular, we obtain the rate of convergence of the blow-up sequences at points of odd frequencies and the regularity of the strata of the corresponding contact set. We also recover the frequency gap for odd frequencies obtained by Savin and Yu.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider an initial-boundary value problem related to some network dynamics where the underlying graph has unbounded edges. We show that there exists a C0-semigroup for this problem using a general result from the literature. We also find an explicit formula for this semigroup. This is achieved using the method of characteristics and then showing that the Laplace transform of the solution is equal to the resolvent operator of the generator.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Mathematical Model for Fluid Transport in Poroelastic Materials in 2D Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical model for the poroelastic materials (PEM) with the variable volume is developed in multidimensional case. Governing equations of the model are constructed using the continuity equations, which reflect the well-known physical laws. The deformation vector is specified using the Terzaghi effective stress tensor. In the two-dimensional space case, the model is studied by analytical methods. Using the classical Lie method, it is proved that the relevant nonlinear system of the (1+2)-dimensional governing equations admits highly nontrivial Lie symmetries leading to an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. The radially-symmetric case is studied in details. It is shown how correct boundary conditions in the case of PEM in the form of a ring and an annulus are constructed. As a result, boundary-value problems with a moving boundary describing the ring (annulus) deformation are constructed.
  The relevant nonlinear boundary-value problems are analytically solved in the stationary case. In particular, the analytical formulae for unknown deformations and an unknown radius of the annulus are presented.</description>

      <title>Point and generalized symmetries of the heat equation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a nice representation for point symmetry transformations of the (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equation and properly interpret them. This allows us to prove that the pseudogroup of these transformations has exactly two connected components. That is, the heat equation admits a single independent discrete symmetry, which can be chosen to be alternating the sign of the dependent variable. We introduce the notion of pseudo-discrete elements of a Lie group and show that alternating the sign of the space variable, which was for a long time misinterpreted as a discrete symmetry of the heat equation, is in fact a pseudo-discrete element of its essential point symmetry group. The classification of subalgebras of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the heat equation is enhanced and the description of generalized symmetries of this equation is refined as well. We also consider the Burgers equation because of its relation to the heat equation and prove that it admits no discrete point symmetries. The developed approach to point-symmetry groups whose elements have components that are linear fractional in some variables can directly be extended to many other linear and nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show anomalous dissipation of scalars advected by weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations with $C^{(\sfrac{1}{3})^-}$ regularity, for an arbitrary initial datum in $\dot H^1 (\T^3)$. This is the first rigorous derivation of zeroth law of scalar turbulence, where the scalar is advected by solution to an equation of hydrodynamics (unforced and deterministic). As a byproduct of our method, we provide a typicality statement for the drift, and recover certain desired properties of turbulence, including a lower bound on scalar variance commensurate with the Richardson pair dispersion hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Optimal concentration level of anisotropic Trudinger-Moser functionals on any bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be convex and homogeneous of degree $1$, its polar $F^{o}$ represent a finsler metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $\Omega$ be any bounded open set in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In this paper, we first construct the theoretical structure of anisotropic harmonic transplantation. Using the anisotropic harmonic transplantation, co-area formula, limiting Sobolev approximation method, delicate estimate of level set of Green function, we investigate the optimal concentration level of the Trudinger-Moser functional \[ \int_{\Omega}e^{\lambda_{n}|u|^{\frac{n}{n-1}}}dx \] under the anisotropic Dirichlet norm constraint $\int_{\Omega}F^{n}\left( \nabla{{u}}\right) dx\leq1$, where $\lambda_{n}=n^{\frac{n}{n-1}}\kappa _{n}^{\frac{1}{n-1}}\ $ denotes the sharp constant of anisotropic Trudinger-Moser inequality in bounded domain and $\kappa_{n}$ is the Lebesgue measure of the unit Wulff ball. As an application. we can immediately deduce the existence of extremals for anisotropic Trudinger-Moser inequality on bounded domain. Finally, we also consider the optimal concentration level of the anisotropic singular Trudinger-Moser functional. The method is based on the limiting Hardy-Sobolev approximation method and constructing a suitable normalized anisotropic concentrating sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider local weak solutions of widely degenerate or singular elliptic PDEs of the type \begin{equation*} -\,\mathrm{div}\left((\vert Du\vert-\lambda)_{+}^{p-1}\frac{Du}{\vert Du\vert}\right)=f \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq2$, $\lambda$ is a positive constant and $(\,\cdot\,)_{+}$ stands for the positive part. We establish some higher differentiability results, under essentially sharp conditions on the datum $f$. For $\lambda=0$, our results give back those contained in [12, 25].</description>

      <title>Stationary non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE: constructive proofs of existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a methodology for establishing constructive proofs of existence of smooth, stationary, non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation. Specifically, given an approximate solution $u_0$, we construct an approximate inverse for the linearization around $u_0$, enabling the development of a Newton-Kantorovich approach. Consequently, we derive a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique localized pattern in the vicinity of $u_0$. The verification of this condition is facilitated through a combination of analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, an additional condition is derived, establishing that the localized pattern serves as the limit of a family of periodic solutions (in space) as the period tends to infinity. The integration of analytical tools and meticulous numerical analysis ensures a comprehensive validation of this condition. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we present computer-assisted proofs for the existence of three distinct unbounded branches of periodic solutions in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation, all converging towards a localized planar pattern, whose existence is also proven constructively. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the electrons of a molecule in the adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory approximation. We establish the well-posedness of the time evolution and its linear response close to a non-degenerate ground state, and prove the appearance of resonances at relevant frequencies. The main mathematical difficulty is due to the structure of the linearized equations, which are not complex-linear. We bypass this difficulty by reformulating the  linearized problem as a real Hamiltonian system, whose stability is ensured by the second-order optimality conditions on the energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Sobolev inequality on noncommutative Euclidean spaces. As a simple consequence, we obtain the Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality and as its application we show global well-posedness of nonlinear PDEs in the noncommutative Euclidean space. Moreover, we show that the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the Nash inequality for possibly different constants in this noncommutative setting by completing the list in noncommutative Varopoulos's theorem in [37]. Finally, we present a direct application of the Nash inequality to compute the time decay for solutions of the heat equation in the noncommutative setting.</description>

Abstract: We study the Carleson measures on NTA and ADP domains in the Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n$ and provide two characterizations of such measures: (1) in terms of the level sets of subelliptic harmonic functions and (2) via the $1$-quasiconformal family of mappings on the Kor\'anyi--Reimann unit ball. Moreover, we establish the $L^2$-bounds for the square function $S_{\alpha}$ of a subelliptic harmonic function and the Carleson measure estimates for the BMO boundary data, both on NTA domains in $\mathbb{H}^n$. Finally, we prove a Fatou-type theorem on $(\epsilon, \delta)$-domains in $\mathbb{H}^n$.</description>

      <title>Curl through spin on three-manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07317v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, many mathematicians have studied the {\em curl operator} on compact (both with or without empty boundary) three-manifolds, mainly the behaviour of its spectrum and some iso\-pe\-ri\-me\-tric problems associated with it. In this paper, we reveal an (unexpected?) relation between this curl operator and the Dirac operator correspondingto any of the spin$^c$ structures on the manifold. Then, we make the ellipticity of $D$ (curl is not) and the many facts already known about the spectrum of $D$ to recuperate with almost immediate proofs some results above curl and obtain others unknown for me. {\em For example, we will find that the eigenvalues of curl, removing the point spectrum zero, are always, up to a fixed constant, lower bounded by those of the Dirac and the equality characterize the round three-sphere}. Also, we also show that {\em there do not exist mean-convex $L^2$-solutions for the isoperimetric problem associated to curl}, as Cantarella, de Turck, Gluck y Teytel \cite{CdTGT} had conjectured, while other authors proved properties for these unknown solutions (adding always whether optimal domains exist) perhaps by thinking in the case of the successful maximization of the {\em helicity.}</description>

Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish curvature estimates for anisotropic Gauss curvature flows. By using this, we show that given a measure $\mu$ with a positive smooth density $f$, any solution to the $L_p$ Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $p \le -n+2$ is a hypersurface of class $C^{1,1}$. This is a sharp result because for each $p\in [-n+2,1)$ there exists a convex hypersurface of class $C^{1,\frac{1}{n+p-1}}$ which is a solution to the $L_p$ Minkowski problem for a positive smooth density $f$. In particular, the $C^{1,1}$ regularity is optimal in the case $p=-n+2$ which includes the logarithmic Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>A geometric view on probabilistically robust learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have achieved super-human performance on many classification tasks, they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards adversarially generated examples. Thus, considerable effort has been invested into reformulating standard Risk Minimization (RM) into an adversarially robust framework. Recently, attention has shifted towards approaches which interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the higher clean accuracy and faster training times of RM. In this paper, we take a fresh and geometric view on one such method -- Probabilistically Robust Learning (PRL). We propose a mathematical framework for understanding PRL, which allows us to identify geometric pathologies in its original formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter functionals to rectify them. We prove existence of solutions to the original and modified problems using novel relaxation methods and also study properties, as well as local limits, of the introduced perimeters. We also clarify, through a suitable $\Gamma$-convergence analysis, the way in which the original and modified PRL models interpolate between risk minimization and adversarial training.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive central limit theorem for a Brownian particle in a critically-correlated incompressible random drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of a diffusion process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ advected by a stationary random vector field which is assumed to be divergence-free, dihedrally symmetric in law and have a log-correlated potential. A special case includes $\nabla^\perp$ of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions. We show the variance of the diffusion process at a large time $t$ behaves like $2 c_* t (\log t)^{1/2}$, in a quenched sense and with a precisely determined, universal prefactor constant $c_*&gt;0$. We also prove a quenched invariance principle under this superdiffusive scaling. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalization group argument in which we inductively analyze coarse-grained diffusivities, scale-by-scale. Our analysis leads to sharp homogenization and large-scale regularity estimates on the infinitesimal generator, which are subsequently transferred into quantitative information on the process.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group and elliptic homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate on the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio~$\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound applies to high-contrast elliptic equations demonstrating near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show that, given a suitable decay of correlation, the length scale at which homogenization is observed is at most $\exp(C \log^3(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation -- and thus the strength of the disorder -- after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we obtain an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach can be interpreted as a rigorous renormalization group argument and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>
