      <title>Wireless Channel Aware Data Augmentation Methods for Deep Leaning-Based Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization is a challenging problem that - unlike outdoor localization - lacks a universal and robust solution. Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep Learning (DL), methods have been investigated as a promising approach. Although such methods bring remarkable localization accuracy, they heavily depend on the training data collected from the environment. The data collection is usually a laborious and time-consuming task, but Data Augmentation (DA) can be used to alleviate this issue. In this paper, different from previously used DA, we propose methods that utilize the domain knowledge about wireless propagation channels and devices. The methods exploit the typical hardware component drift in the transceivers and/or the statistical behavior of the channel, in combination with the measured Power Delay Profile (PDP). We comprehensively evaluate the proposed methods to demonstrate their effectiveness. This investigation mainly focuses on the impact of factors such as the number of measurements, augmentation proportion, and the environment of interest impact the effectiveness of the different DA methods. We show that in the low-data regime (few actual measurements available), localization accuracy increases up to 50%, matching non-augmented results in the high-data regime. In addition, the proposed methods may outperform the measurement-only high-data performance by up to 33% using only 1/4 of the amount of measured data. We also exhibit the effect of different training data distribution and quality on the effectiveness of DA. Finally, we demonstrate the power of the proposed methods when employed along with Transfer Learning (TL) to address the data scarcity in target and/or source environments.</description>

      <title>Passivity-Based Gain-Scheduled Control with Scheduling Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers gain-scheduling of very strictly passive (VSP) subcontrollers using scheduling matrices. The use of scheduling matrices, over scalar scheduling signals, realizes greater design freedom, which in turn can improve closed-loop performance. The form and properties of the scheduling matrices such that the overall gain-scheduled controller is VSP are explicitly discussed. The proposed gain-scheduled VSP controller is used to control a rigid two-link robot subject to model uncertainty where robust input-output stability is assured via the passivity theorem. Numerical simulation results highlight the greater design freedom, resulting in improved performance, when scheduling matrices are used over scalar scheduled signals.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Equivalent Identification of Interconnected Areas Using Disturbance records from Synchro phasor Measurement Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a methodology for modelling a dynamic equivalent of an external area is presented. The equivalent consists of a generator with series impedance and a parallel load (generalized Ward equivalent), integrating control systems such as the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) and the Speed Regulator (GOV) in a test system known as PST-16. The main objective is to identify the parameters of the control systems and other parameters inherent to the generator so that the response of the equivalent system is similar to the response of the complete system.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Phase Unbalance and Coordination Impacts on Distribution Network Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DER) provides distribution system operators (DSO) with new flexible resources to support more efficient operation and planning of distribution networks. To utilise these resources, various DER flexibility aggregation methods have been proposed in the literature, such as aggregated P-Q flexibility areas at the interface with other networks. However, whereas focusing on estimating the limits of flexibility services, existing studies make the critical assumption that all available flexible units are perfectly coordinated to jointly provide flexibility and manage network constraints. Moreover, due to the extensive use of single-phase power flow analysis, the impacts of phase unbalance on DER flexibility aggregation remain largely unexplored. To address these gaps in knowledge, this work proposes a framework for modelling flexibility services in low voltage (LV) distribution networks which enables explicitly imposing voltage unbalance and phase coordination constraints. The simulations, performed for an illustrative 5-bus system and a real 221-bus LV network in the UK, demonstrate that a significant share (over 30%) of total aggregated DER flexibility potential may be unavailable due to voltage unbalances and lack of coordination between DER connected to different phases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the enhancement of lunar landing precision through an advanced structured light system, integrating machine learning, Iterative Learning Control (ILC) and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) techniques. By employing Moire fringe patterns for high-precision scanning maneuvers, the study addresses the limitations of conventional structured light systems. A nonlinear mathematical optimization model is developed to refine the world model, optimizing oscillation frequency and amplitude to improve resolution. The findings suggest that this approach can double the conventional resolution, promising significant advancements in the accuracy of lunar landings, with potential real-time application.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing of Electric Vehicle Charging Station Alliances Under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the centralization of charging stations (CSs), CSs are organized as charging station alliances (CSAs) in the commercial competition. Under this situation, this paper studies the profit-oriented dynamic pricing strategy of CSAs. As the practicability basis, a privacy-protected bidirectional real-time information interaction framework is designed, under which the status of EVs is utilized as the reference for pricing, and the prices of CSs are the reference for charging decisions. Based on this framework, the decision-making models of EVs and CSs are established, in which the uncertainty caused by the information asymmetry between EVs and CSs and the bounded rationality of EV users are integrated. To solve the pricing decision model, the evolutionary game theory is adopted to describe the dynamic pricing game among CSAs, the equilibrium of which gives the optimal pricing strategy. Finally, the case study results in a real urban area in Shanghai, China verifies the practicability of the framework and the effectiveness of the dynamic pricing strategy.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Power System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a framework for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in power system applications. Inspired by the recently proposed KAN architecture, this paper proposes physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), a novel KAN-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) tailored to efficiently and accurately learn dynamics within power systems. The PIKANs present a promising alternative to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) based PINNs, achieving superior accuracy in predicting power system dynamics while employing a smaller network size. Simulation results on a single-machine infinite bus system and a 4-bus 2- generator system underscore the accuracy of the PIKANs in predicting rotor angle and frequency with fewer learnable parameters than conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate PIKANs capability to accurately identify uncertain inertia and damping coefficients. This work opens up a range of opportunities for the application of KANs in power systems, enabling efficient determination of grid dynamics and precise parameter identification.</description>

      <title>A hybrid neural network for real-time OD demand calibration under disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing automated urban traffic management systems, designed to mitigate traffic congestion and reduce emissions in real time, face significant challenges in effectively adapting to rapidly evolving conditions. Predominantly reactive, these systems typically respond to incidents only after they have transpired. A promising solution lies in implementing real-time traffic simulation models capable of accurately modelling environmental changes. Central to these real-time traffic simulations are origin-destination (OD) demand matrices. However, the inherent variability, stochasticity, and unpredictability of traffic demand complicate the precise calibration of these matrices in the face of disruptions. This paper introduces a hybrid neural network (NN) architecture specifically designed for real-time OD demand calibration to enhance traffic simulations' accuracy and reliability under both recurrent and non-recurrent traffic conditions. The proposed hybrid NN predicts the OD demand to reconcile the discrepancies between actual and simulated traffic patterns. To facilitate real-time updating of the internal parameters of the NN, we develop a metamodel-based backpropagation method by integrating data from real-world traffic systems and simulated environments. This ensures precise predictions of the OD demand even in the case of abnormal or unpredictable traffic patterns. Furthermore, we incorporate offline pre-training of the NN using the metamodel to improve computational efficiency. Validation through a toy network and a Tokyo expressway corridor case study illustrates the model's ability to dynamically adjust to shifting traffic patterns across various disruption scenarios. Our findings underscore the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in developing proactive traffic management strategies, offering substantial improvements over traditional reactive systems.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Distributed Filtering under Mismatched Noise Covariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the performance of consensus-based distributed filtering under mismatched noise covariances. First, we introduce three performance evaluation indices for such filtering problems,namely the standard performance evaluation index, the nominal performance evaluation index, and the estimation error covariance. We derive difference expressions among these indices and establish one-step relations among them under various mismatched noise covariance scenarios. We particularly reveal the effect of the consensus fusion on these relations. Furthermore, the recursive relations are introduced by extending the results of the one-step relations. Subsequently, we demonstrate the convergence of these indices under the collective observability condition, and show this convergence condition of the nominal performance evaluation index can guarantee the convergence of the estimation error covariance. Additionally, we prove that the estimation error covariance of the consensus-based distributed filter under mismatched noise covariances can be bounded by the Frobenius norms of the noise covariance deviations and the trace of the nominal performance evaluation index. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Modeling Errors on Distributed Continuous-time Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive performance analysis of the distributed continuous-time filtering in the presence of modeling errors. First, we introduce two performance indices, namely the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. By leveraging the nominal performance index and the Frobenius norm of the modeling deviations, we derive the bounds of the estimation error covariance and the lower bound of the nominal performance index. Specifically, we reveal the effect of the consensus parameter on both bounds. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, an incorrect process noise covariance can lead to the divergence of the estimation error covariance. Moreover, we investigate the properties of the eigenvalues of the error dynamical matrix. In the context of switching topological configurations, we provide a sufficient condition that ensures the stability of the error dynamical matrix. Furthermore, we explore the magnitude relations between the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Designing Consensus-Based Distributed Filtering over Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel consensus-on-only-measurement distributed filter over directed graphs under the collectively observability condition. First, the distributed filter structure is designed with an augmented leader-following measurement fusion strategy. Subsequently, two parameter design methods are presented, and the consensus gain parameter is devised utilizing local information exclusively rather than global information. Additionally, the lower bound of the fusion step is derived to guarantee a uniformly upper bound of the estimation error covariance. Moreover, the lower bounds of the convergence rates of the steady-state performance gap between the proposed algorithm and the centralized filter are provided with the fusion step approaching infinity. The analysis demonstrates that the convergence rate is, at a minimum, as rapid as exponential convergence under the spectral norm condition of the communication graph. The transient performance is also analyzed with the fusion step tending to infinity. The inherent trade-off between the communication cost and the filtering performance is revealed from the analysis of the steady-state performance and the transient performance. Finally, the theoretical results are substantiated through the validation of two simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-based Volt-Var Control in Partially Observable Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverter-based volt-var control is studied in this paper. One key issue in DRL-based approaches is the limited measurement deployment in active distribution networks, which leads to problems of a partially observable state and unknown reward. To address those problems, this paper proposes a robust DRL approach with a conservative critic and a surrogate reward. The conservative critic utilizes the quantile regression technology to estimate conservative state-action value function based on the partially observable state, which helps to train a robust policy; the surrogate rewards of power loss and voltage violation are designed that can be calculated from the limited measurements. The proposed approach optimizes the power loss of the whole network and the voltage profile of buses with measurable voltages while indirectly improving the voltage profile of other buses. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness of the robust DRL approach in different limited measurement conditions, even when only the active power injection of the root bus and less than 10% of bus voltages are measurable.</description>

      <title>Residual Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-based Volt-Var Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A residual deep reinforcement learning (RDRL) approach is proposed by integrating DRL with model-based optimization for inverter-based volt-var control in active distribution networks when the accurate power flow model is unknown. RDRL learns a residual action with a reduced residual action space, based on the action of the model-based approach with an approximate model. RDRL inherits the control capability of the approximate-model-based optimization and enhances the policy optimization capability by residual policy learning. Additionally, it improves the approximation accuracy of the critic and reduces the search difficulties of the actor by reducing residual action space. To address the issues of "too small" or "too large" residual action space of RDRL and further improve the optimization performance, we extend RDRL to a boosting RDRL approach. It selects a much smaller residual action space and learns a residual policy by using the policy of RDRL as a base policy. Simulations demonstrate that RDRL and boosting RDRL improve the optimization performance considerably throughout the learning stage and verify their rationales point-by-point, including 1) inheriting the capability of the approximate model-based optimization, 2) residual policy learning, and 3) learning in a reduced action space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new methodology for the synthesis of wide-angle scanning arrays is proposed. It is based on the formulation of the array design problem as a multi-objective one where, for each scan angle, both the radiated power density in the scan direction and the total reflected power are accounted for. A set of numerical results from full-wave simulated examples - dealing with different radiators, arrangements, frequencies, and number of elements - is reported to show the features of the proposed approach as well as to assess its potentialities.</description>

      <title>On the Improvement of the Performance of Inexpensive Electromagnetic Skins by means of an Inverse Source Design Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new methodology for the improvement of the performance of inexpensive static passive electromagnetic skins (SP-EMSs) is presented. The proposed approach leverages on the non-uniqueness of the inverse source problem associated to the SP-EMS design by decomposing the induced surface current into pre-image (PI) and null-space (NS) components. Successively, the unknown EMS layout and NS expansion coefficients are determined by means of an alternate minimization of a suitable cost function. This latter quantifies the mismatch between the ideal surface current, which radiates the user-defined target field, and that actually induced on the EMS layout. Results from a representative set of numerical experiments, concerned with the design of EMSs reflecting pencil-beam as well as contoured target patterns, are reported to assess the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the performance of inexpensive EMS realizations. The measurements on an EMS prototype, featuring a conductive ink pattern printed on a standard paper substrate, are also shown to prove the reliability of the synthesis process.</description>

      <title>Verification of Diagnosability for Cyber-Physical Systems: A Hybrid Barrier Certificate Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosability is a system theoretical property characterizing whether fault occurrences in a system can always be detected within a finite time. In this paper, we investigate the verification of diagnosability for cyber-physical systems with continuous state sets. We develop an abstraction-free and automata-based framework to verify (the lack of) diagnosability, leveraging a notion of hybrid barrier certificates. To this end, we first construct a (delta,K)-deterministic finite automaton that captures the occurrence of faults targeted for diagnosis. Then, the verification of diagnosability property is converted into a safety verification problem over a product system between the automaton and the augmented version of the dynamical system. We demonstrate that this verification problem can be addressed by computing hybrid barrier certificates for the product system. To this end, we introduce two systematic methods, leveraging sum-of-squares programming and counter-example guided inductive synthesis to search for such certificates. Additionally, if the system is found to be diagnosable, we propose methodologies to construct a diagnoser to identify fault occurrences online. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our methods through a case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bounded model checking algorithm for signal temporal logic (STL) that exploits mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). A key technical element is our novel MILP encoding of the STL semantics; it follows the idea of stable partitioning from the recent work on SMT-based STL model checking. Assuming that our (continuous-time) system models can be encoded to MILP -- typical examples are rectangular hybrid automata (precisely) and hybrid dynamics with closed-form solutions (approximately) -- our MILP encoding yields an optimization-based model checking algorithm that is scalable, is anytime/interruptible, and accommodates parameter mining. Experimental evaluation shows our algorithm's performance advantages especially for complex STL formulas, demonstrating its practical relevance e.g. in the automotive domain.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Intent-Aware Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the use of robust model predictive control for the design of an intent-aware collision avoidance system for multi-agent aircraft engaged in horizontal maneuvering scenarios. We assume that information from other agents is accessible in the form of waypoints or destinations. Consequently, we consider that other agents follow their optimal Dubin's path--a trajectory that connects their current state to their intended state--while accounting for potential uncertainties. We propose using scenario tree model predictive control as a robust approach that offers computational efficiency. We demonstrate that the proposed method can easily integrate intent information and offer a robust scheme that handles different uncertainties. The method is illustrated through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Cascade Q-learning: Algorithms and Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the optimal Q-function of $\gamma$-discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the synchronous setting, where independent samples for all state-action pairs are drawn from a generative model at each iteration. We introduce and analyze a novel model-free algorithm called Variance-Reduced Cascade Q-learning (VRCQ). VRCQ comprises two key building blocks: (i) the established direct variance reduction technique and (ii) our proposed variance reduction scheme, Cascade Q-learning. By leveraging these techniques, VRCQ provides superior guarantees in the $\ell_\infty$-norm compared with the existing model-free stochastic approximation-type algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate that VRCQ is minimax optimal. Additionally, when the action set is a singleton (so that the Q-learning problem reduces to policy evaluation), it achieves non-asymptotic instance optimality while requiring the minimum number of samples theoretically possible. Our theoretical results and their practical implications are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Design of a Double-joint Robotic Fish Using a Composite Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic fish is one of the most promising directions of the new generation of underwater vehicles. Traditional biomimetic fish often mimic fish joints using tandem components like servos, which leads to increased volume, weight and control complexity. In this paper, a new double-joint robotic fish using a composite linkage was designed, where the propulsion mechanism transforms the single-degree-of-freedom rotation of the motor into a double-degree-of-freedom coupled motion, namely caudal peduncle translation and caudal fin rotation. Motion analysis of the propulsion mechanism demonstrates its ability to closely emulate the undulating movement observed in carangiform fish. Experimental results further validate the feasibility of the proposed propulsion mechanism. To improve propulsion efficiency, an analysis is conducted to explore the influence of swing angle amplitude and swing frequency on the swimming speed of the robotic fish. This examination establishes a practical foundation for future research on such robotic fish systems.</description>

      <title>Compact robotic gripper with tandem actuation for selective fruit harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective fruit harvesting is a challenging manipulation problem due to occlusions and clutter arising from plant foliage. A harvesting gripper should i) have a small cross-section, to avoid collisions while approaching the fruit; ii) have a soft and compliant grasp to adapt to different fruit geometry and avoid bruising it; and iii) be capable of rigidly holding the fruit tightly enough to counteract detachment forces. Previous work on fruit harvesting has primarily focused on using grippers with a single actuation mode, either suction or fingers. In this paper we present a compact robotic gripper that combines the benefits of both. The gripper first uses an array of compliant suction cups to gently attach to the fruit. After attachment, telescoping cam-driven fingers deploy, sweeping obstacles away before pivoting inwards to provide a secure grip on the fruit for picking. We present and analyze the finger design for both ability to sweep clutter and maintain a tight grasp. Specifically, we use a motorized test bed to measure grasp strength for each actuation mode (suction, fingers, or both). We apply a tensile force at different angles (0{\deg}, 15{\deg}, 30{\deg} and 45{\deg}), and vary the point of contact between the fingers and the fruit. We observed that with both modes the grasp strength is approximately 40 N. We use an apple proxy to test the gripper's ability to obtain a grasp in the presence of occluding apples and leaves, achieving a grasp success rate over 96% (with an ideal controller). Finally, we validate our gripper in a commercial apple orchard.</description>

      <title>Robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise in quantum computing devices poses a key challenge in their realization. In this paper, we study the robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols against coherent control errors, which are multiplicative Hamlitonian errors causing detrimental effects on current quantum devices. We show that the norm of the Hamiltonian quantifies the robustness against these errors, motivating the introduction of an additional regularization term in the cost function. We analyze the optimality conditions of the resulting robust quantum optimal control problem based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, showing that robust protocols admit larger smooth annealing sections. This suggests that quantum annealing admits improved robustness in comparison to bang-bang solutions such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the improved robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Network-Constrained Demand Response Game for Procuring Energy Balancing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Securely and efficiently procuring energy balancing services in distribution networks remains challenging, especially within a privacy-preserving environment. This paper proposes a network-constrained demand response game, i.e., a Generalized Nash Game (GNG), to incentivize energy consumers to offer balancing services. Specifically, we adopt a supply function-based bidding method for our demand response problem, where a requisite load adjustment must be met. To ensure the secure operation of distribution networks, we incorporate physical network constraints, including line capacity and bus voltage limits, into the game formulation. In addition, we analytically evaluate the efficiency loss of this game. Previous approaches to steer energy consumers toward the Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) of the game often necessitated sharing some private information, which might not be practically feasible or desired. To overcome this limitation, we propose a decentralized market clearing algorithm with analytical convergence guarantees, which only requires the participants to share limited, non-sensitive information with others. Numerical analyses illustrate that the proposed market mechanism exhibits a low market efficiency loss. Moreover, these analyses highlight the critical role of integrating physical network constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our proposed algorithm by conducting simulations on the IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus test systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear TDOA for Accurate Source Localization in Complex Signal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex and dynamic propagation of oscillations and waves is often triggered by sources at unknown locations. Accurate source localization enables the elimination of the rotor core in atrial fibrillation (AFib) as an effective treatment for such severe cardiac disorder; it also finds potential use in locating the spreading source in natural disasters such as forest fires and tsunamis. However, existing approaches such as time of arrival (TOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) do not yield accurate localization results since they tacitly assume a constant signal propagation speed whereas realistic propagation is often non-static and heterogeneous. In this paper, we develop a nonlinear TDOA (NTDOA) approach which utilizes observational data from various positions to jointly learn the propagation speed at different angles and distances as well as the location of the source itself. Through examples of simulating the complex dynamics of electrical signals along the surface of the heart and satellite imagery from forest fires and tsunamis, we show that with a small handful of measurements, NTDOA, as a data-driven approach, can successfully locate the spreading source, leading also to better forecasting of the speed and direction of subsequent propagation.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Control-Oriented Identification of Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning is an effective approach for controlling an unknown system. It is based on a longstanding pipeline familiar to the control community in which one performs experiments on the environment to collect a dataset, uses the resulting dataset to identify a model of the system, and finally performs control synthesis using the identified model. As interacting with the system may be costly and time consuming, targeted exploration is crucial for developing an effective control-oriented model with minimal experimentation. Motivated by this challenge, recent work has begun to study finite sample data requirements and sample efficient algorithms for the problem of optimal exploration in model-based reinforcement learning. However, existing theory and algorithms are limited to model classes which are linear in the parameters. Our work instead focuses on models with nonlinear parameter dependencies, and presents the first finite sample analysis of an active learning algorithm suitable for a general class of nonlinear dynamics. In certain settings, the excess control cost of our algorithm achieves the optimal rate, up to logarithmic factors. We validate our approach in simulation, showcasing the advantage of active, control-oriented exploration for controlling nonlinear systems.</description>

Abstract: In this correspondence, we propose a joint mechanical and electrical adjustment of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for the performance improvements of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. In particular, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) MIMO channel model for the mechanically-tilted IRS in general deployment, and consider two types of scenarios with and without the direct path of LEO-ground user link due to the orbital flight. With the aim of maximizing the end-to-end performance, we jointly optimize tilting angle and phase shift of IRS along with the transceiver beamforming, whose performance superiority is verified via simulations with the Orbcomm LEO satellite using a real orbit data.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents analysis results of the operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) that combine feedforward paths and multistage amplifiers to achieve high-gain wideband operation as well as frequency compensation. To analyze multistage feedforward OTAs and provide an intuitive design method, the successive one-pole approximation (SOPA) is used for each substage of a multistage feedforward OTA. Using SOPA, the stability analysis is carried out from the two-stage feedforward OTA to the four-stage feedforward OTA in this work.</description>

      <title>Weyl Calculus and Exactly Solvable Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges with Quadratic State Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge--a stochastic dynamical generalization of optimal mass transport--exhibits a learning-control duality. Viewed as a stochastic control problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers a given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control effort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a stochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely distribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations, i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over the manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov kernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as a state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in quantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help determine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding the Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus, recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite polynomials.</description>
