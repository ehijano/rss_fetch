      <title>The 2-Dimensional Constraint Loop Problem is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear constraint loop is specified by a system of linear
  inequalities that define the relation between the values of the
  program variables before and after a single execution of the loop
  body. In this paper we consider the problem of determining whether
  such a loop terminates, i.e., whether all maximal executions are
  finite, regardless of how the loop is initialised and how the
  non-determinism in the loop body is resolved. We focus on the
  variant of the termination problem in which the loop variables range
  over $\mathbb{R}$. Our main result is that the termination problem
  is decidable over the reals in dimension~2. A more abstract
  formulation of our main result is that it is decidable whether a
  binary relation on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that is given as a conjunction of
  linear constraints is well-founded.</description>

      <title>(Co)condition hits the Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an enhancement to inductive types and records in a dependent type theory, namely (co)conditions. With a primitive interval type, conditions generalize the cubical syntax of higher inductive types in homotopy type theory, while coconditions generalize the cubical path type. (Co)conditions are also useful without an interval type. The duality between conditions and coconditions is presented in an interesting way: The elimination principles of inductive types with conditions can be internalized with records with coconditions and vice versa.
  However, we do not develop the metatheory of conditions and coconditions in this paper. Instead, we only present the type checking.</description>

      <title>Source-level reasoning for quantitative information flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel formal system for proving quantitative-leakage properties of programs. Based on a theory of Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) that models information leakage as a noisy communication channel, it uses "gain-functions" for the description and measurement of expected leaks.
  We use a small imperative programming language, augmented with leakage features, and with it express adversaries' activities in the style of, but more generally than, the Hoare triples or expectation transformers that traditionally express deterministic or probabilistic correctness but without information flow.
  The programs are annotated with "gain-expressions" that capture simple adversarial settings such as "Guess the secret in one try." but also much more general ones; and our formal syntax and logic -based framework enables us to transform such gain-expressions that apply after a program has finished to ones that equivalently apply before the program has begun.
  In that way we enable a formal proof-based reasoning system for QIF at the source level. We apply it to the %programming language we have chosen, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a number of small but sometimes intricate situations.</description>

      <title>Analogical proportions II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogical reasoning is the ability to detect parallels between two seemingly distant objects or situations, a fundamental human capacity used for example in commonsense reasoning, learning, and creativity which is believed by many researchers to be at the core of human and artificial general intelligence. Analogical proportions are expressions of the form ``$a$ is to $b$ what $c$ is to $d$'' at the core of analogical reasoning. The author has recently introduced an abstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions within the general setting of universal algebra. It is the purpose of this paper to further develop the mathematical theory of analogical proportions within that framework as motivated by the fact that it has already been successfully applied to logic program synthesis in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Non-Deterministic Planning for Hyperproperty Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-deterministic planning aims to find a policy that achieves a given objective in an environment where actions have uncertain effects, and the agent - potentially - only observes parts of the current state. Hyperproperties are properties that relate multiple paths of a system and can, e.g., capture security and information-flow policies. Popular logics for expressing temporal hyperproperties - such as HyperLTL - extend LTL by offering selective quantification over executions of a system. In this paper, we show that planning offers a powerful intermediate language for the automated verification of hyperproperties. Concretely, we present an algorithm that, given a HyperLTL verification problem, constructs a non-deterministic multi-agent planning instance (in the form of a QDec-POMDP) that, when admitting a plan, implies the satisfaction of the verification problem. We show that for large fragments of HyperLTL, the resulting planning instance corresponds to a classical, FOND, or POND planning problem. We implement our encoding in a prototype verification tool and report on encouraging experimental results.</description>

      <title>Tools at the Frontiers of Quantitative Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of formal models that include quantitative aspects such as timing or probabilistic choices is performed by quantitative verification tools. Broad and mature tool support is available for computing basic properties such as expected rewards on basic models such as Markov chains. Previous editions of QComp, the comparison of tools for the analysis of quantitative formal models, focused on this setting. Many application scenarios, however, require more advanced property types such as LTL and parameter synthesis queries as well as advanced models like stochastic games and partially observable MDPs. For these, tool support is in its infancy today. This paper presents the outcomes of QComp 2023: a survey of the state of the art in quantitative verification tool support for advanced property types and models. With tools ranging from first research prototypes to well-supported integrations into established toolsets, this report highlights today's active areas and tomorrow's challenges in tool-focused research for quantitative verification.</description>

      <title>The complexity of deciding characteristic formulae in van Glabbeek's branching-time spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristic formulae give a complete logical description of the behaviour of processes modulo some chosen notion of behavioural semantics. They allow one to reduce equivalence or preorder checking to model checking, and are exactly the formulae in the modal logics characterizing classic behavioural equivalences and preorders for which model checking can be reduced to equivalence or preorder checking.
  This paper studies the complexity of determining whether a formula is characteristic for some finite, loop-free process in each of the logics providing modal characterizations of the simulation-based semantics in van Glabbeek's branching-time spectrum. Since characteristic formulae in each of those logics are exactly the consistent and prime ones, it presents complexity results for the satisfiability and primality problems, and investigates the boundary between modal logics for which those problems can be solved in polynomial time and those for which they become computationally hard.
  Amongst other contributions, this article also studies the complexity of constructing characteristic formulae in the modal logics characterizing simulation-based semantics, both when such formulae are presented in explicit form and via systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Traffic Scenario Logic: A Spatial-Temporal Logic for Modeling and Reasoning of Urban Traffic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal representations of traffic scenarios can be used to generate test cases for the safety verification of autonomous driving. However, most existing methods are limited in highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Towards Counting Markov Equivalence Classes with Logical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of counting Markov Equivalence Classes (MEC) under logical constraints. MECs are equivalence classes of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that encode the same conditional independence structure among the random variables of a DAG model. Observational data can only allow to infer a DAG model up to Markov Equivalence. However, Markov equivalent DAGs can represent different causal structures, potentially super-exponentially many. Hence, understanding MECs combinatorially is critical to understanding the complexity of causal inference. In this paper, we focus on analysing MECs of size one, with logical constraints on the graph topology. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm (w.r.t. the number of nodes) for enumerating essential DAGs (the only members of an MEC of size one) with arbitrary logical constraints expressed in first-order logic with two variables and counting quantifiers (C^2). Our work brings together recent developments in tractable first-order model counting and combinatorics of MECs.</description>

      <title>Verifying Global Two-Safety Properties in Neural Networks with Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first automated verification technique for confidence-based 2-safety properties, such as global robustness and global fairness, in deep neural networks (DNNs). Our approach combines self-composition to leverage existing reachability analysis techniques and a novel abstraction of the softmax function, which is amenable to automated verification. We characterize and prove the soundness of our static analysis technique. Furthermore, we implement it on top of Marabou, a safety analysis tool for neural networks, conducting a performance evaluation on several publicly available benchmarks for DNN verification.</description>

      <title>A logic of judgmental existence and its relation to proof irrelevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple natural deduction system for reasoning with judgments of the form "there exists a proof of $\varphi$" to explore the notion of judgmental existence following Martin-L\"{o}f's methodology of distinguishing between judgments and propositions. In this system, the existential judgment can be internalized into a modal notion of propositional existence that is closely related to truncation modality, a key tool for obtaining proof irrelevance, and lax modality. We provide a computational interpretation in the style of the Curry-Howard isomorphism for the existence modality and show that the corresponding system has some desirable properties such as strong normalization or subject reduction.</description>

      <title>Logical Characterizations of Recurrent Graph Neural Networks with Reals and Floats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pioneering work from 2019, Barcel\'o and coauthors identified logics that precisely match the expressive power of constant iteration-depth graph neural networks (GNNs) relative to properties definable in first-order logic. In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata, drawing links to distributed computing models.</description>

      <title>Verifying Lock-free Search Structure Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and verify template algorithms for lock-free concurrent search structures that cover a broad range of existing implementations based on lists and skiplists. Our linearizability proofs are fully mechanized in the concurrent separation logic Iris. The proofs are modular and cover the broader design space of the underlying algorithms by parameterizing the verification over aspects such as the low-level representation of nodes and the style of data structure maintenance. As a further technical contribution, we present a mechanization of a recently proposed method for reasoning about future-dependent linearization points using hindsight arguments. The mechanization builds on Iris' support for prophecy reasoning and user-defined ghost resources. We demonstrate that the method can help to reduce the proof effort compared to direct prophecy-based proofs.</description>

      <title>Safe and Personalizable Logical Guidance for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles necessitate a delicate balance between safety, efficiency, and user preferences in trajectory planning. Existing traditional or learning-based methods face challenges in adequately addressing all these aspects. In response, this paper proposes a novel component termed the Logical Guidance Layer (LGL), designed for seamless integration into autonomous driving trajectory planning frameworks, specifically tailored for highway scenarios. The LGL guides the trajectory planning with a local target area determined through scenario reasoning, scenario evaluation, and guidance area calculation. Integrating the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, the LGL ensures formal safety guarantees while accommodating various user preferences defined by logical formulae. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the LGL in achieving a balance between safety and efficiency, and meeting user preferences in autonomous highway driving scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Machine-learned language models have transformed everyday life: they steer us when we study, drive, manage money. They have the potential to transform our civilization. But they hallucinate. Their realities are virtual. This note provides a high-level overview of language models and outlines a low-level model of learning machines. It turns out that, after they become capable of recognizing hallucinations and dreaming safely, as humans tend to be, the language-learning machines proceed to generate broader systems of false beliefs and self-confirming theories, as humans tend to do.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine Sweedler's classic theory of measuring coalgebras -- by which $k$-algebras are enriched in $k$-coalgebras for $k$ a field -- with the theory of W-types -- by which the categorical semantics of inductive data types in functional programming languages are understood. In our main theorem, we find that under some hypotheses, algebras of an endofunctor are enriched in coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and we find polynomial endofunctors provide many interesting examples of this phenomenon. We then generalize the notion of initial algebra of an endofunctor using this enrichment, thus generalizing the notion of W-type. This article is an extended version of arXiv:2303.16793, it adds expository introductions to the original theories of measuring coalgebras and W-types along with some improvements to the main theory and many explicitly worked examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on finite state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (= multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an operad of spliced arrows $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NDFA is a functor satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties, from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C} : Oper \to Cat$, which we call the contour category construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of tree contour words. This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows iff it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.08530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of these notes is to give a categorical semantics for the transpension type (Nuyts and Devriese, Transpension: The Right Adjoint to the Pi-type, Accepted at LMCS, 2024), which is right adjoint to a potentially substructural dependent function type. In section 2 we discuss some prerequisites. In section 3, we define multipliers and discuss their properties. In section 4, we study how multipliers lift from base categories to presheaf categories. In section 5, we explain how typical presheaf modalities can be used in the presence of the transpension type. In section 6, we study commutation properties of prior modalities, substitution modalities and multiplier modalities.</description>

      <title>Transpension: The Right Adjoint to the Pi-type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.08533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presheaf models of dependent type theory have been successfully applied to model HoTT, parametricity, and directed, guarded and nominal type theory. There has been considerable interest in internalizing aspects of these presheaf models, either to make the resulting language more expressive, or in order to carry out further reasoning internally, allowing greater abstraction and sometimes automated verification. While the constructions of presheaf models largely follow a common pattern, approaches towards internalization do not. Throughout the literature, various internal presheaf operators ($\surd$, $\Phi/\mathsf{extent}$, $\Psi/\mathsf{Gel}$, $\mathsf{Glue}$, $\mathsf{Weld}$, $\mathsf{mill}$, the strictness axiom and locally fresh names) can be found and little is known about their relative expressivenes. Moreover, some of these require that variables whose type is a shape (representable presheaf, e.g. an interval) be used affinely.
  We propose a novel type former, the transpension type, which is right adjoint to universal quantification over a shape. Its structure resembles a dependent version of the suspension type in HoTT. We give general typing rules and a presheaf semantics in terms of base category functors dubbed multipliers. Structural rules for shape variables and certain aspects of the transpension type depend on characteristics of the multiplier. We demonstrate how the transpension type and the strictness axiom can be combined to implement all and improve some of the aforementioned internalization operators (without formal claim in the case of locally fresh names).</description>

      <title>Coinductive Streams in Monoidal Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce monoidal streams. Monoidal streams are a generalization of causal stream functions, which can be defined in cartesian monoidal categories, to arbitrary symmetric monoidal categories. In the same way that streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with pure functions, monoidal streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with theories of processes represented by a symmetric monoidal category. Monoidal streams also form a feedback monoidal category. In the same way that we can use a coinductive stream calculus to reason about signal flow graphs, we can use coinductive string diagrams to reason about feedback monoidal categories. As an example, we study syntax for a stochastic dataflow language, with semantics in stochastic monoidal streams.</description>

      <title>Tractable and Intractable Entailment Problems in Separation Logic with Inductively Defined Predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish various complexity results for the entailment problem between formulas in Separation Logic with user-defined predicates denoting recursive data structures. The considered fragments are characterized by syntactic conditions on the inductive rules that define the semantics of the predicates. We focus on so-called P-rules, which are similar to (but simpler than) the PCE rules introduced by Iosif et al. in 2013. In particular, for a specific fragment where predicates are defined by so-called loc-deterministic inductive rules, we devise a sound and complete cyclic proof procedure running in polynomial time. Several complexity lower bounds are provided, showing that any relaxing of the provided conditions makes the problem intractable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the expressivity and the complexity of various logics in probabilistic team semantics with the Boolean negation. In particular, we study the extension of probabilistic independence logic with the Boolean negation, and a recently introduced logic FOPT. We give a comprehensive picture of the relative expressivity of these logics together with the most studied logics in probabilistic team semantics setting, as well as relating their expressivity to a numerical variant of second-order logic. In addition, we introduce novel entropy atoms and show that the extension of first-order logic by entropy atoms subsumes probabilistic independence logic. Finally, we obtain some results on the complexity of model checking, validity, and satisfiability of our logics.</description>

      <title>A Truly Concurrent Semantics for Reversible CCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversible CCS (RCCS) is a well-established, formal model for reversible communicating systems, which has been built on top of the classical Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS). In its original formulation, each CCS process is equipped with a memory that records its performed actions, which is then used to reverse computations. More recently, abstract models for RCCS have been proposed in the literature, basically, by directly associating RCCS processes with (reversible versions of) event structures. In this paper we propose a different abstract model: starting from one of the well-known encoding of CCS into Petri nets we apply a recently proposed approach to incorporate causally-consistent reversibility to Petri nets, obtaining as result the (reversible) net counterpart of every RCCS term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study existence and computability of finite bases for ideals of polynomials over infinitely many variables. In our setting, variables come from a countable logical structure A, and embeddings from A to A act on polynomials by renaming variables. First, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for A to guarantee the following generalisation of Hilbert's Basis Theorem: every polynomial ideal which is equivariant, i.e. invariant under renaming of variables, is finitely generated. Second, we develop an extension of classical Buchberger's algorithm to compute a Gr\"obner basis of a given equivariant ideal. This implies decidability of the membership problem for equivariant ideals. Finally, we sketch upon various applications of these results to register automata, Petri nets with data, orbit-finitely generated vector spaces, and orbit-finite systems of linear equations.</description>

      <title>Composing Codensity Bisimulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proving compositionality of behavioral equivalence on state-based systems with respect to algebraic operations is a classical and widely studied problem. We study a categorical formulation of this problem, where operations on state-based systems modeled as coalgebras can be elegantly captured through distributive laws between functors. To prove compositionality, it then suffices to show that this distributive law lifts from sets to relations, giving an explanation of how behavioral equivalence on smaller systems can be combined to obtain behavioral equivalence on the composed system.
  In this paper, we refine this approach by focusing on so-called codensity lifting of functors, which gives a very generic presentation of various notions of (bi)similarity as well as quantitative notions such as behavioral metrics on probabilistic systems. The key idea is to use codensity liftings both at the level of algebras and coalgebras, using a new generalization of the codensity lifting. The problem of lifting distributive laws then reduces to the abstract problem of constructing distributive laws between codensity liftings, for which we propose a simplified sufficient condition. Our sufficient condition instantiates to concrete proof methods for compositionality of algebraic operations on various types of state-based systems. We instantiate our results to prove compositionality of qualitative and quantitative properties of deterministic automata. We also explore the limits of our approach by including an example of probabilistic systems, where it is unclear whether the sufficient condition holds, and instead we use our setting to give a direct proof of compositionality. ...</description>

      <title>Masked Hard-Attention Transformers Recognize Exactly the Star-Free Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expressive power of transformers over inputs of unbounded size can be studied through their ability to recognize classes of formal languages. We consider transformer encoders with hard attention (in which all attention is focused on exactly one position) and strict future masking (in which each position only attends to positions strictly to its left), and prove that they are equivalent to linear temporal logic (LTL), which defines exactly the star-free languages. A key technique is the use of Boolean RASP as a convenient intermediate language between transformers and LTL. We then take numerous results known for LTL and apply them to transformers, characterizing how position embeddings, strict masking, and depth increase expressive power.</description>

Abstract: We present a new language semantics for real-time concurrency. Its operational models are higher-dimensional timed automata (HDTAs), a generalization of both higher-dimensional automata and timed automata. We define languages of HDTAs as sets of interval-timed pomsets with interfaces. As an application, we show that language inclusion of HDTAs is undecidable. On the other hand, using a region construction we can show that untimings of HDTA languages have enough regularity so that untimed language inclusion is decidable.</description>

      <title>A Profunctorial Semantics for Quantum Supermaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify morphisms of strong profunctors as a categorification of quantum supermaps. These black-box generalisations of diagrams-with-holes are hence placed within the broader field of profunctor optics, as morphisms in the category of copresheaves on concrete networks. This enables the first construction of abstract logical connectives such as tensor products and negations for supermaps in a totally theory-independent setting. These logical connectives are found to be all that is needed to abstractly model the key structural features of the quantum theory of supermaps: black-box indefinite causal order, black-box definite causal order, and the factorisation of definitely causally ordered supermaps into concrete circuit diagrams. We demonstrate that at the heart of these factorisation theorems lies the Yoneda lemma and the notion of representability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new angle on the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by studying how the predictions of a GNN probabilistic classifier evolve as we apply it on larger graphs drawn from some random graph model. We show that the output converges to a constant function, which upper-bounds what these classifiers can uniformly express. This strong convergence phenomenon applies to a very wide class of GNNs, including state of the art models, with aggregates including mean and the attention-based mechanism of graph transformers. Our results apply to a broad class of random graph models, including sparse and dense variants of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, the stochastic block model, and the Barab\'asi-Albert model. We empirically validate these findings, observing that the convergence phenomenon appears not only on random graphs but also on some real-world graphs.</description>

As an application, we extend the differential calculus of Joyal's analytic functors to analytic functors between presheaf categories, just as ordinary calculus extends from a single variable to many variables.</description>
