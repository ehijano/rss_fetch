      <title>Non-separable wave evolution equations in quantum kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-separable wave-like integro-differential equation for the time evolution of the Wigner distribution function in phase space is educed from the corresponding separable kinetic equation. It is shown that it leads to non-local dispersion effects that may involve complex group velocities and also display non-unitary features as entropy production. By employing the quantum hydrodynamical description a non-local evolution wave equation is also derived by synthesizing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with that of continuity, which predicts the generation of quadrupole quantum effects in the propagation of the spatial probability density. Extension of the formalism for a boson scalar field is also presented along with a brief commentary on the issue of irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Basis of spinors expressed by differential forms and calculating its norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basis of spinors in three-dimensional Euclidean space is expressed by differential forms. Its expression is found from the spectral decomposition of the modified Hamiltonian describing Weyl semimetals where the wavenumber parameters are replaced by the differential forms. The generalization of the definitions of differential forms including not only fractional powers but also any algebraic functions is justified by algebraic extension of the symmetric Fock space isomorphic to multivariable polynomial ring. We furthermore define the inner product for these fractional-order differential forms written in two ways; the formal power series and the multiple integral. While the norms of the powers $\mathrm{d}s^{2\nu}$ are reduced to the variant of Dyson's integral and have the value $2\nu+1$, possibly related to the dimension of irreducible representation, the norm of two-component spinor is given by the integral \[I=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{x^2+y^2\ge 1 \&amp; 0\le x \le 1 \&amp; 0 \le y \le 1}\frac{xy\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y}{\sqrt{(1-x)(1-y)(x^2+y^2-1)}}=\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\int_0^1\frac{(1+\sqrt{z})}{(1+z)^3}\big[2E(z)-(1-z)K(z)\big]\mathrm{d}z\simeq 1.774, \] where $K(z)$ and $E(z)$ are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, respectively. The product can also be generalized to include one parameter $p$ analogous to those in $L^p$ space, reducing to the original one when $p=2$. The norm with $p=\infty$ is considered as an example and the result for $ \nu=-\frac{1}{2} $ is written by the Watson-Iwata integral. We also discuss the ambiguity of the definition of the spinor under coordinate rotation originating from Berry's phase, and point out that if we heuristically set $\mathrm{d}s=0$, the ambiguity disappears, though its implication remains unclear.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometric analysis of RN black holes under f(R) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the RN black hole under f(R) gravity and its thermodynamic properties. We begin by examining the small fluctuations around the equilibrium state and summarizing the expression for the modified thermodynamic entropy of this black hole. Additionally, we delve into the geometric thermodynamics (GTD) of black holes and investigate the suitability of the curvature scalar of the GTD method for the phase transition point of the black hole. Moreover, we investigate the effects of modified parameters on the thermodynamic behavior of black holes.Within the framework of $f(R)$ modified gravity theory, we discovered that several RN black holes demonstrate thermodynamic properties resembling those of an ideal gas when the initial curvature scalar of the black hole remains constant. However, if the initial curvature scalar is non-constant and the cosmological constant term possesses a negative exponent, the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes could exhibit characteristics akin to those of a van der Waals gas.We separately list the general solutions for the case of non-negative powers and the special solutions for the case of negative powers. We observe that, under certain conditions, the phase transition analogous to the Van der Waals gas exists for charged black holes under f(R) gravity.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in the conformally flat Eisenhart metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.20022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (4+1) dimensional conformally flat Eisenhart geometry is investigated in this work, stressing the contribution of the stress tensor generating its curvature. The energy-momentum tensor $T^{a}_{~b}$ is traceless and has only one nonzero component. It could be written as an anisotropic fluid with null transversal pressures and nonzero energy fluxes. The null and timelike geodesics are computed in the pure cosmological case when the Eisenhart potential energy is $V(r) = -m\omega^{2}r^{2}/2$, where $\omega$ is related to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Although the metric is curved, the radial null geodesics $R(T)$ and $Y(T)$ are straight lines, with finite $R_{max}$ and $Y_{max}$, $Y$ being the 5th coordinate. In contrast, for a radial timelike geodesic, $Y_{max} \rightarrow \infty$ if $T \rightarrow T_{max} = 1/\omega$.</description>
