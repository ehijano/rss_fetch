      <title>ORCA: A Global Ocean Emulator for Multi-year to Decadal Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean dynamics plays a crucial role in driving global weather and climate patterns. Accurate and efficient modeling of ocean dynamics is essential for improved understanding of complex ocean circulation and processes, for predicting climate variations and their associated teleconnections, and for addressing the challenges of climate change. While great efforts have been made to improve numerical Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs), accurate forecasting of global oceanic variations for multi-year remains to be a long-standing challenge. Here, we introduce ORCA (Oceanic Reliable foreCAst), the first data-driven model predicting global ocean circulation from multi-year to decadal time scales. ORCA accurately simulates the three-dimensional circulations and dynamics of the global ocean with high physical consistency. Hindcasts of key oceanic variables demonstrate ORCA's remarkable prediction skills in predicting ocean variations compared with state-of-the-art numerical OGCMs and abilities in capturing occurrences of extreme events at the subsurface ocean and ENSO vertical patterns. These results demonstrate the potential of data-driven ocean models for providing cheap, efficient, and accurate global ocean modeling and prediction. Moreover, ORCA stably and faithfully emulates ocean dynamics at decadal timescales, demonstrating its potential even for climate projections. The model will be available at https://github.com/OpenEarthLab/ORCA.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Air Quality Impact of Prescribed Fires Using Graph Neural Network-Based PM$_{2.5}$ Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing size and severity of wildfires across the western United States have generated dangerous levels of PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations in recent years. In a changing climate, expanding the use of prescribed fires is widely considered to be the most robust fire mitigation strategy. However, reliably forecasting the potential air quality impact from prescribed fires, which is critical in planning the prescribed fires' location and time, at hourly to daily time scales remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) based forecasting model for hourly PM$_{2.5}$ predictions across California. Using a two-step approach, we leverage our forecasting model to estimate the PM$_{2.5}$ contribution of wildfires. Integrating the GNN-based PM$_{2.5}$ forecasting model with prescribed fire simulations, we propose a novel framework to forecast the PM$_{2.5}$ pollution of prescribed fires. This framework helps determine March as the optimal month for implementing prescribed fires in California and quantifies the potential air quality trade-offs involved in conducting more prescribed fires outside the fire season.</description>
