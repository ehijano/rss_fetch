      <title>Highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks contributing to divergent genomic evolution of human and chimpanzee brain development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergence during mammalian evolution of concordant and divergent traits of genomic regulatory networks encompassing ubiquitous, qualitatively nearly identical yet quantitatively distinct arrays of sequences of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for 716 proteins is reported. A vast majority of TFs (770 of 716; 98%) comprising protein constituents of these networks appear to share common Gene Ontology (GO) features of sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding (GO: 1990837). Genome-wide and individual chromosome-level analyses of 17,935 ATAC-seq-defined brain development regulatory regions (BDRRs) revealed nearly universal representations of TFBS for TF-constituents of these networks, TFBS densities of which appear consistently higher within thousands BDRRs of Modern Humans compare to Chimpanzee. Transposable elements (TE), including LTR/HERV, SINE/Alu, SVA, and LINE families, appear to harbor and spread genome-wide consensus regulatory nodes of identified herein highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks, selections of TFBS panels of which manifest individual chromosome-specific profiles and species-specific divergence patterns. Collectively, observations reported in this contribution highlight a previously unrecognized essential function of human genomic DNA sequences encoded by TE in providing genome-wide regulatory seed templates of highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks likely contributing to continuing divergent genomic evolution of human and chimpanzee brain development.</description>

      <title>Multi-variable control to mitigate loads in CRISPRa networks: Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of CRISPR-mediated gene activation (CRISPRa) has transformed the way in which we perform genetic screening, bioproduction and therapeutics through its ability to scale and multiplex. However, the emergence of loads on the key molecular resources constituting CRISPRa by the orthogonal short RNA that guide such resources to gene targets, couple theoretically independent CRISPRa modules. This coupling negates the ability of CRISPRa systems to concurrently regulate multiple genes independent of one another. In this paper, we propose to reduce this coupling by mitigating the loads on the molecular resources that constitute CRISPRa. In particular, we design a multi-variable controller that makes the concentration of these molecular resources robust to variations in the level of the short RNA loads. This work serves as a foundation to design and implement CRISPRa controllers for practical applications.</description>
