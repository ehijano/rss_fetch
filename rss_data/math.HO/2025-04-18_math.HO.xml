      <title>A cute proof that makes $e$ natural</title>

Abstract: The number $e$ has rich connections throughout mathematics, and has the honor of being the base of the natural logarithm. However, most students finish secondary school (and even university) without suitably memorable intuition for why $e$'s various mathematical properties are related. This article presents a solution.
  Various proofs for all of the mathematical facts in this article have been well-known for years. This exposition contributes a short, conceptual, intuitive, and visual proof (comprehensible to Pre-Calculus students) of the equivalence of two of the most commonly-known properties of $e$, connecting the continuously-compounded-interest limit $\big(1 + \frac{1}{n}\big)^n$ to the fact that $e^x$ is its own derivative. The exposition further deduces a host of commonly-taught properties of $e$, while minimizing pre-requisite knowledge, so that this article can be practically used for developing secondary school curricula.
  Since $e$ is such a well-trodden concept, it is hard to imagine that our visual proof is new, but it certainly is not widely known. The author checked 100 books across 7 countries, as well as YouTube videos totaling over 25 million views, and still has not found this method taught anywhere. This article seeks to popularize the 3-page explanation of $e$, while providing a unified, practical, and open-access reference for teaching about $e$.</description>
