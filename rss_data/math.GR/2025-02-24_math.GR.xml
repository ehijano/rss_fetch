      <title>The Diophantine problem in Thompson's group F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Diophantine problem in Thompson's group F is undecidable. Our proof uses the facts that F has finite commutator width and rank 2 abelianisation, then uses similar arguments used by B\"uchi and Senger and Ciobanu and Garreta to show the Diophantine problem in free groups and monoids with abelianisation constraints is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Maximal Representation Dimensions of Algebraic Tori of Fixed Dimension Over Arbitrary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the representation dimension of an algebraic torus $T$ to be the minimal positive integer $r$ such that there exists a faithful embedding $T \hookrightarrow \operatorname{GL}_r$. Given a positive integer $n$, there exists a maximal representation dimension of all $n$-dimensional algebraic tori over all fields. In this paper, we use the theory of group actions on lattices to find lower bounds on this maximum for all $n$. Further, we find the exact maximum value for irreducible tori for all $n \in \left\lbrace 1, 2, \dots, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23\right\rbrace$ and conjecturally infinitely many primes $n$.</description>

      <title>Divisibility rules for integers presented as permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we represent integers in a type of factoradic notation. Rather than use the corresponding Lehmer code, we will view integers as permutations. Given a pair of integers n and k, we give a formula for n mod k in terms of the factoradic digits, and use this to deduce various divisibility rules.</description>

      <title>Coarse cops and robber in graphs and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abstract shortened to meet arxiv's length requirements) We investigate two variants of the classical Cops and robber game in graphs, recently introduced by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche. The two versions are played in infinite graphs and the goal of the cops is to prevent the robber to visit some ball of finite radius (chosen by the robber) infinitely many times. Moreover the cops and the robber move at a different speed, and the cops can choose a radius of capture before the game starts. Depending on the order in which the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak version and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus two variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the strong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under quasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely generated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do not depend on the chosen set of generators.
  We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Mart\'inez-Pedroza. This includes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under quasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and graphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong cop number. Moreover we tie the weak cop number of a graph $G$ to the existence of asymptotic minors of large tree-width in $G$, and use the result to prove that any finitely presented group has weak cop number 1 or $\infty$.
  We have learned very recently that some of our results have been obtained independently by Appenzeller and Klinge, using fairly different arguments.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy Class Growth in Virtually Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conjugacy class growth function in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. That is, the number of elements in the ball of radius $n$ in the Cayley graph which intersect a fixed conjugacy class. In the class of virtually abelian groups, we prove that this function is always asymptotically equivalent to a polynomial. Furthermore, we show that in any affine Coxeter group, the degree of polynomial growth of a conjugacy class is equivalent to the reflection length of any element of that class.</description>

      <title>Residually finite amenable groups that are not Hilbert-Schmidt stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of residually finite amenable groups that are not Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) stable. We construct finitely generated, class 3 nilpotent by cyclic examples and solvable linear finitely presented examples. This also provides the first examples of amenable groups that are very flexibly HS-stable but not flexibly HS-stable and the first examples of residually finite amenable groups that are not locally HS-stable. Along the way we exhibit (necessarily not-finitely-generated) class 2 nilpotent groups $G = A\rtimes \Z$ with $A$ abelian such that the periodic points of the dual action are dense but it does not admit dense periodic measures. Finally we use the Tikuisis-White-Winter theorem to show all of the examples are not even operator-HS-stable; they admit operator norm almost homomorphisms that can not be HS-perturbed to true homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Some characterizations of weak left braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generalizations of skew left braces, weak left braces were introduced recently by Catino, Mazzotta, Miccoli and Stefanelli to study ceratin special degenerate set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. In this note, as analogues of the notions of regular subgroups of holomorph of groups, Gamma functions on groups and affine and semi-affine structures on groups, we propose the notions of good inverse subsemigroups and Gamma functions associated to Clifford semigroups and affine structures on inverse semigroups, respectively, by which weak left braces are characterized. Moreover, symmetric, $\lambda$-homomorphic and $\lambda$-anti-homomorphic weak left braces are introduced and the algebraic structures of these weak left braces are given.</description>

      <title>Simpler algorithmically unrecognizable 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov proved that there exists an unrecognizable 4-manifold, that is, a 4-manifold for which the homeomorphism problem is undecidable. In this paper we consider the question how close we can get to S^4 with an unrecognizable manifold. One of our achievements is that we show a way to remove so-called Markov's trick from the proof of existence of such a manifold. This trick contributes to the complexity of the resulting manifold. We also show how to decrease the deficiency (or the number of relations) in so-called Adian-Rabin set which is another ingredient that contributes to the complexity of the resulting manifold. Altogether, our approach allows to show that the connected sum #_9(S^2 x S^2) is unrecognizable while the previous best result is the unrecognizability of #_12(S^2 x S^2) due to Gordon.</description>
