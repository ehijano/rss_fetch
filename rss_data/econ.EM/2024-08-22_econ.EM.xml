      <title>Inference with Many Weak Instruments and Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers inference in a linear instrumental variable regression model with many potentially weak instruments and treatment effect heterogeneity. I show that existing tests can be arbitrarily oversized in this setup. Then, I develop a valid procedure that is robust to weak instrument asymptotics and heterogeneous treatment effects. The procedure targets a JIVE estimand, calculates an LM statistic, and compares it with critical values from a normal distribution. To establish this procedure's validity, this paper shows that the LM statistic is asymptotically normal and a leave-three-out variance estimator is unbiased and consistent. The power of the LM test is also close to a power envelope in an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Towards an Inclusive Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Morocco: CGEM's Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corporate social responsibility encourages companies to integrate social and environmental concerns into their activities and their relations with stakeholders. It encompasses all actions aimed at the social good, above and beyond corporate interests and legal requirements. Various international organizations, authors and researchers have explored the notion of CSR and proposed a range of definitions reflecting their perspectives on the concept. In Morocco, although Moroccan companies are not overwhelmingly embracing CSR, several factors are encouraging them to integrate the CSR approach not only into their discourse, but also into their strategies. The CGEM is actively involved in promoting CSR within Moroccan companies, awarding the "CGEM Label for CSR" to companies that meet the criteria set out in the CSR Charter. The process of labeling Moroccan companies is in full expansion. The graphs presented in this article are broken down according to several criteria, such as company size, sector of activity and listing on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, in order to provide an overview of CSR-labeled companies in Morocco. The approach adopted for this article is a qualitative one aimed at presenting, firstly, the different definitions of the CSR concept and its evolution over time. In this way, the study focuses on the Moroccan context to dissect and analyze the state of progress of CSR integration in Morocco and the various efforts made by the CGEM to implement it. According to the data, 124 Moroccan companies have been awarded the CSR label. For a label in existence since 2006, this figure reflects a certain reluctance on the part of Moroccan companies to fully implement the CSR approach in their strategies. Nevertheless, Morocco is in a transitional phase, marked by the gradual adoption of various socially responsible practices.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayes Treatment Choice with Partial Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of binary treatment choice problems with partial identification, through the lens of robust (multiple prior) Bayesian analysis. We use a convenient set of prior distributions to derive ex-ante and ex-post robust Bayes decision rules, both for decision makers who can randomize and for decision makers who cannot.
  Our main messages are as follows: First, ex-ante and ex-post robust Bayes decision rules do not tend to agree in general, whether or not randomized rules are allowed. Second, randomized treatment assignment for some data realizations can be optimal in both ex-ante and, perhaps more surprisingly, ex-post problems. Therefore, it is usually with loss of generality to exclude randomized rules from consideration, even when regret is evaluated ex-post.
  We apply our results to a stylized problem where a policy maker uses experimental data to choose whether to implement a new policy in a population of interest, but is concerned about the external validity of the experiment at hand (Stoye, 2012); and to the aggregation of data generated by multiple randomized control trials in different sites to make a policy choice in a population for which no experimental data are available (Manski, 2020; Ishihara and Kitagawa, 2021).</description>

      <title>L2-Convergence of the Population Principal Components in the Approximate Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that under the condition that the eigenvalues are asymptotically well separated and stable, the normalised principal components of a r-static factor sequence converge in mean square. Consequently, we have a generic interpretation of the principal components estimator as the normalised principal components of the statically common space. We illustrate why this can be useful for the interpretation of the PC-estimated factors, performing an asymptotic theory without rotation matrices and avoiding singularity issues in factor augmented regressions.</description>

      <title>Testing for Nonlinear Cointegration under Heteroskedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article discusses Shin (1994, Econometric Theory)-type tests for nonlinear cointegration in the presence of variance breaks. We build on cointegration test approaches under heteroskedasticity (Cavaliere and Taylor, 2006, Journal of Time Series Analysis) and nonlinearity, serial correlation, and endogeneity (Choi and Saikkonen, 2010, Econometric Theory) to propose a bootstrap test and prove its consistency. A Monte Carlo study shows the approach to have satisfactory finite-sample properties in a variety of scenarios. We provide an empirical application to the environmental Kuznets curves (EKC), finding that the cointegration test provides little evidence for the EKC hypothesis. Additionally, we examine a nonlinear relation between the US money demand and the interest rate, finding that our test does not reject the null of a smooth transition cointegrating relation</description>

      <title>Estimating overidentified linear models with heteroskedasticity and outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17615v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large degree of overidentification causes severe bias in TSLS. A conventional heuristic rule used to motivate new estimators in this context is approximate bias. This paper formalizes the definition of approximate bias and expands the applicability of approximate bias to various classes of estimators that bridge OLS, TSLS, and Jackknife IV estimators (JIVEs). By evaluating their approximate biases, I propose new approximately unbiased estimators, including UOJIVE1 and UOJIVE2. UOJIVE1 can be interpreted as a generalization of an existing estimator UIJIVE1. Both UOJIVEs are proven to be consistent and asymptotically normal under a fixed number of instruments and controls. The asymptotic proofs for UOJIVE1 in this paper require the absence of high leverage points, whereas proofs for UOJIVE2 do not. In addition, UOJIVE2 is consistent under many-instrument asymptotic. The simulation results align with the theorems in this paper: (i) Both UOJIVEs perform well under many instrument scenarios with or without heteroskedasticity, (ii) When a high leverage point coincides with a high variance of the error term, an outlier is generated and the performance of UOJIVE1 is much poorer than that of UOJIVE2.</description>

      <title>A Note on Identification of Match Fixed Effects as Interpretable Unobserved Match Affinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight that match fixed effects, represented by the coefficients of interaction terms involving dummy variables for two elements, lack identification without specific restrictions on parameters. Consequently, the coefficients typically reported as relative match fixed effects by statistical software are not interpretable. To address this, we establish normalization conditions that enable identification of match fixed effect parameters as interpretable indicators of unobserved match affinity, facilitating comparisons among observed matches. Using data from middle school students in the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), we highlight the distribution of comparable match fixed effects within a specific school.</description>

      <title>Online Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts, which yields the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional distribution moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.</description>
