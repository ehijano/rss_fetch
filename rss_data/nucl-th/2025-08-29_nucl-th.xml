      <title>Chiral restoration temperature at finite spin density in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a uniform spin density on the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition in finite-temperature QCD in the scope of the linear sigma model. We demonstrate that at a finite spin potential $\mu_\Sigma$, corresponding to a finite spin density, the predictive power of the model is challenged by an ambiguity associated with a contribution of the vacuum renormalization term to the free energy. Eliminating the regularization freedom through comparison with recent low-$\mu_{\Sigma}$ lattice data, we extend the phase diagram of QCD at finite spin density to regions inaccessible to lattice simulations. We show that, as the spin potential increases, the temperature of the chiral crossover transition diminishes and the chiral crossover turns into a first-order transition at a second-order critical end-point $(T,\mu_\Sigma)_\mathrm{CEP}\simeq (0.142,0.098)$ GeV. With increasing spin potential, the critical temperature touches the zero-temperature axis at $\mu_{\Sigma} = 0.310$ GeV, implying that the chiral symmetry is restored at higher potentials at any temperature.</description>

      <title>Configuration mixing effects on neutrinoless $\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing and coexistence of intrinsic nuclear shapes play an important role to determine the low-energy structure of heavy nuclei, and are expected to affect nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. This problem is addressed in the interacting boson model with configuration mixing that is formulated by using the nuclear energy density functional theory. It is shown that significant amounts of mixing of normal and deformed intruder configurations are present in the ground and excited $0^+$ states in the even-even nuclei that are parent or daughter nuclei of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. An illustrative application to the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays of $^{76}$Ge, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, and $^{150}$Nd shows that the inclusion of the configuration mixing reduces the NMEs for most of the $0^+_1$ $\to$ $0^+_1$ $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

      <title>Perturbative high-energy evolution in the IP-Glasma initial state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We include the perturbative JIMWLK energy evolution into the IP-Glasma initial state description used to simulate the early-time dynamics in heavy ion collisions. By numerically solving the JIMWLK equation on an event-by-event basis, we obtain the energy (Bjorken-$x$) dependent structure of the colliding nuclei. Combining the initial state with hydrodynamic simulations, this enables us to predict how observables evolve when moving from RHIC to LHC energies.</description>

      <title>$\Xi NN$ three-baryon force from SU(3) chiral effective field theory: A femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The development of SU(3) chiral effective field theory has opened the way to a systematic exploration of three-baryon forces (3BFs), a key ingredient in hypernuclear and dense matter physics. However, $\Xi NN$ 3BF based on SU(3) chiral EFT has not been studied until now.
  Purpose: We apply SU(3) chiral EFT for the first time to derive $\Xi NN$ potentials in momentum space. Then, we investigate how the $\Xi NN$ 3BF affects the correlation function of deuteron-$\Xi^-$ pair created through heavy-ion collisions.
  Methods: To reduce the number of low-energy constants involved in the $\Xi NN$ potentials, we employ the decuplet saturation approximation, by which only two of them remain unconstrained.
  Results: We found that the effect of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF on the deuteron-$\Xi^-$ correlation function is at most about 4%. This is because the deuteron and $\Xi^-$ interact with each other mainly at low momentum, corresponding to peripheral scattering, where the influence of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF is limited.
  Conclusions: High-momentum scattering of the deuteron off $\Xi^-$ is expected to be a promising probe of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF, offering an alternative to femtoscopic analyses of the correlation function.</description>

      <title>Medium effects on the electromagnetic form factors of $\rho$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of partons inside the light $\rho$ meson is found to be essential for its properties and internal structure, both in free space and in the nuclear medium. In this paper, we systematically investigate the in-medium structure changes of $\rho^+$ mesons within the covariant Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, utilizing the Schwinger proper-time regularization scheme. We solve the Bethe-Salpeter equations to guarantee the bound meson-state condition. At the quark level, the nuclear medium effects are also derived within the same NJL model to maintain a consistent approach with the in-medium $\rho^+$ meson electromagnetic form factors. To this end, we analyze the spacelike electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho^+$ meson in free space and in a nuclear medium. We find that the charge radius and quadrupole moment of the $\rho^+$ meson increase with increasing nuclear matter density, while the magnetic moment decreases, in agreement with the existing previous theoretical predictions. The enhancement of the $\rho^+$ meson charge radius at normal density relative to that in free space is about 11\% (0.08 fm), while the reduction of $\rho^+$ meson magnetic moment is about 8\% (0.20 $\mu_N$). Our predictions for the charge radius, magnetic moment, and quadrupole moment of the $\rho^+$ meson in both free space and nuclear medium, remain challenging to be verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium transport in a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quarkonium production in high-energy heavy-ion collisions remains a key probe of the quark-gluon plasma formed in these reactions, but the development of a fully integrated nonperturbative approach remains a challenge. Toward this end, we set up a semiclassical transport approach that combines nonperturbative reaction rates rooted in lattice-constrained $T$-matrix interactions with a viscous hydrodynamic medium evolution. Bottomonium suppression is computed along trajectories in the hydrodynamic evolution while regeneration is evaluated via a rate equation extended to a medium with spatial gradients. The much larger reaction rates compared to previous calculations markedly enhance both dissociation and regeneration processes. This, in particular, requires a reliable assessment of bottomonium equilibrium limits and of the non-thermal distributions of the bottom quarks transported through the expanding medium. Within current uncertainties our approach can describe the centrality dependence of bottomonium yields measured in Pb-Pb ($\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$=5.02\,TeV) collisions at the LHC, while discrepancies are found at large transverse momenta.</description>

      <title>Far from equilibrium attractors in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the connection between attractor solutions known from studies of Bjorken flow in conformal models of relativistic fluid dynamics and the more general description of attractors as submanifolds in phase space. We show how to determine sections of the attractor on slices of constant proper time, and point out that in conformal models one may choose a parametrisation of the extended phase space such that the intersection of the attractor with a slice of constant proper time is the same on all slices. In consequence, it is possibleto project these intersections and one finds that the result reproduces the attractor solution. This projection allows for an expressive picture of hydrodynamisation, but the attractor can be equally well described without taking advantage of this convenience. An immediate implication of these observations is that conformal symmetry does not play a significant role in the emergence of early-time attraction. We illustrate this by describing the hydrodynamic attractor in a simple model where conformal symmetry is broken by the equation of state. Our findings can be applied to studies of hydrodynamic attractors in more general situations, also beyond the context of quark-gluon plasma dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the initial condition model TRENTo for sampling the number of partons inside the nucleons that participate in a heavy-ion collision. This sampling method is based on parton distribution functions (PDFs) and therefore has a natural dependence on the momentum transferred in the collision and the scale being probed during the collision. We examine the resulting distributions and their dependence on the momentum transfer. Additionally, we explore the sensitivity of different observables on the number of partons using the TRENTo framework and the estimators available therein for final-state observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Bethe-Salpeter framework, we present a computation of space-like electromagnetic form factors for pseudoscalar mesons, including light and heavy-light systems. Our approach employs a flavour-dependent variation of the standard Taylor effective charge, which contains key contributions from the quark-gluon vertices. This effective interaction is a common ingredient of all relevant dynamical equations, and accommodates the crucial mass differences between the various quark flavours. Particular attention is paid to the nonperturbative determination of the quark-photon vertex. The computed electromagnetic form factors for the pion and the kaon mesons show excellent agreement with experimental determinations. In addition, the predictions for the charge radii of heavy-light systems are in overall good agreement with lattice QCD.</description>

Abstract: We study the (3+1)D structure of the Glasma in the dilute approximation, which allows us to describe the longitudinal dynamics that arise from the three-dimensional nuclear structure. We employ a nuclear model with tunable longitudinal and transverse fluctuation scales that generalizes the McLerran-Venugopalan model. We discuss the longitudinal profiles of the energy-momentum tensor and the transverse structure of the local rest frame energy density.</description>

Abstract: We summarize and update using new NICER measurements the results of arXiv:2401.16253, in which we used various astrophysical neutron-star observations to set an upper bound on the CFL color-superconducting gap in a range of baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B \in [2.1,3.2]$, above those reached within neutron stars. We also corroborate the ``reasonable" constraint from arXiv:2401.16253 on the maximum value of the color-superconducting gap by performing a new Bayesian analysis using a prior that extends a two-segment Gaussian process connecting the whole density range between CEFT and pQCD.</description>

      <title>New UPC results at the LHC - modeling the proton and neutron emission in photon-induced nuclear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions provide rich spectrum of possibilities to discuss the response of the nucleus to photons. Newly published neutron and proton multiplicities measured in the ALICE experiment in ultraperipheral collisions allow investigating the influence of the electromagnetic fields on colliding nuclei for the $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.02~TeV. The theoretical predictions are done within hybrid model including equivalent photon approximations (EPA), GiBUU modeling of pre-equilibrium processes and generation of the exited nuclear remnants, which decay is modeled by statistical approach: GEM2 or GEMINI++. The cross-sections of the mass-charge distributions of nuclear remnants as well as the neutron, proton and other charged particle multiplicities are estimated. We concentrate on production of protons and isotopes coming from the electromagnetic dissociation. Special attention is devoted to emission of a single proton. The cross section for $1p$ emission is very close to maximal available one based on reactions of photon with individual nucleons. Our pre-equilibrium processes explain simultaneously the tail of neutron energy distributions in the nuclear rest frame observed in $\gamma + A$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a general expression for the streaming term in radiative transport equa- tions and other transport problems when formulated in curvilinear coordinates, emphasizing coordinate systems adapted to the geometry of the domain and the directional dependence of particle transport. By parametrizing the angular vari- able using a local orthonormal frame, we express directional derivatives in terms of curvature-related quantities that reflect the geometry of underlying spatial man- ifolds. Our formulation highlights how the interaction between coordinate choices and curvature influences the streaming operator, offering geometric interpretations of its components. The resulting framework offers intuitive insight into when and how angular dependence can be simplified and may guide the selection of coordinate systems that balance analytical tractability and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for jet modification in the presence of the QGP background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet interactions with the color-deconfined QCD medium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are conventionally assessed by measuring the modification of the distributions of jet observables with respect to their baselines in proton-proton collisions. Deep learning methods enable per-jet evaluation of these modifications, enhancing the use of jets as precision probes of the nuclear medium. In this work, we predict the jet-by-jet fractional energy loss $\chi$ for jets evolving through a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. To approximate realistic experimental conditions, we embed medium-modified jets in a thermal background and apply Constituent Subtraction for background removal. Two network architectures are studied: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet images, and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) using particle clouds. We find that CNNs achieve accurate predictions for background-free jets but degrade in the presence of the QGP background and remain below the background-free baseline even after background subtraction. In contrast, DGCNNs applied to background-subtracted particle clouds maintain high accuracy across the entire $\chi$ range, demonstrating the advantage of point-cloud-based graph neural networks that exploit full jet structure under realistic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the existence of massive neutron stars and asymptotic freedom of QCD place robust upper bounds on the lowest sound speed of the ultra-dense matter unattainable in neutron stars. Centered on worst-case scenarios, our limits are the most conservative among physical equations of state in the density range $\sim 2-40 n_0$. Discovery of $\gtrsim 2.6 M_\odot$ neutron stars, in combination with current multimessenger astrophysical constraints on the equation of state, would strongly support first-order phase transitions at high baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Symmetry properties of pair correlations in heavy deformed nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleons are known to form pairing correlations with various types of spin-symmetries. Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''</description>

      <title>Photonuclear Tomography in Ultraperipheral Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of photonuclear tomography as a novel technique for probing the internal structure of nuclei. In this approach, ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) serve as a source of intense fluxes of virtual photons, which induce coherent production of vector mesons. By analyzing the probabilities and cross sections of these photon-induced processes, we propose a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of nucleons within the nucleus. Our framework provides a systematic way to access information on the nuclear geometry probed in UPCs, offering new opportunities for studies of nuclear structure using particle production as a probe. Numerical calculations for selected examples illustrate the feasibility and potential of this method.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star with Dark Matter Admixture: A Candidate for Bridging the Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars, white dwarfs and black holes are the after death remnants of massive stars. However, according to the most recent observations, the neutron stars maximum mass is between $2.0-2.5 M_{\odot}$ while black holes of less than 5 $M_{\odot}$ has not yet been observed. The region between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole is called the mass-gap. If indeed its existence is confirmed by future observations, that indicates a gap in our understanding which seeks for explanation. In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass-gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this study, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass-gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass-gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting and non-annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids it is only gravitational. Fundamental questions about how these objects form and how they can be detected are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Test for universality of short-range correlations in pion-induced Drell-Yan Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear modification and the universality of short-range correlation (SRC) in pion-induced Drell-Yan process. Employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and pion PDFs, the ratio of differential cross sections of different nuclei relative to the free nucleon is presented. A kind of universal modification function was proposed which would provide nontrivial tests of SRC universality on the platform of pion-induced Drell-Yan. This work improves our understanding of nuclear structure and strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Thomson coefficient of quark-gluon plasma in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collision experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider offer a unique platform to study several key properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of strongly interacting matter. Quarks, being the electrically charged particles, can induce an electric current in the medium in response to the temperature gradients. Hence, the QGP medium can behave like a thermoelectric medium. The thermoelectric coefficients, such as the Seebeck and Thomson coefficients, can help us to understand the intricate transport phenomenon of the medium. In peripheral collisions, the intense, transient, and time-dependent magnetic field created due to spectator protons significantly influences the thermoelectric properties of the QGP medium, affecting the charge and heat transport. This work uses the quasi-particle model to calculate the Thomson coefficient in QGP. The Thomson effect, describing the continuous heating or cooling of the charge-carrying medium in the presence of temperature gradients, remains largely unexplored in QGP. The Seebeck effect, which relates temperature gradients to induced electric fields, has been widely studied in the literature. For the first time, we calculate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. We have studied their dependence on temperature, baryon chemical potential, center of mass energy, and time-dependent magnetic field with different decay parameters. The transverse Thomson effect originates due to the presence of the Nernst effect in the presence of a magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the higher-order thermoelectric transport properties of the QGP medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>
