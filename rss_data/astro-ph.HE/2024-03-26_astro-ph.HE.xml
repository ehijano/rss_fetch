      <title>Cosmic hide and seek: the volumetric rate of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength extragalactic nuclear transients, particularly those detectable as multi-messengers, are among the primary drivers for the next-generation observatories. X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are the most recent and perhaps most peculiar addition to this group. Here, we report a first estimate of the volumetric rate of QPEs based on the first four discoveries with the eROSITA X-ray telescope onboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma observatory. Under the assumption, supported by a suite of simulated light curves, that these four sources sample the intrinsic population somewhat homogeneously, we correct for their detection efficiency and compute a QPE abundance of $\mathscr{R}_{{\rm vol}} = 0.60_{-0.43}^{+4.73} \times 10^{-6}\,$Mpc$^{-3}$ above an intrinsic average $\log L_{\rm 0.5-2.0\,keV}^{\rm peak} &gt; 41.7$. Since the exact lifetime of QPEs ($\tau_{\rm life}$) is currently not better defined than between a few years or few decades, we convert this to a formation rate of $\mathscr{R}_{\rm vol}/\tau_{\rm life}\approx 0.6 \times 10^{-7} (\tau_{\rm life}/10\,\mathrm{y})^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-3}\,$year$^{-1}$. As a comparison, this value is a factor $\sim10\,\tau_{\rm life}$ times smaller than the formation rate of tidal disruption events. The origin of QPEs is still debated, although lately most models suggest that they are the electromagnetic counterpart of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this scenario, the QPE rate would thus be the first-ever constraint (i.e. a lower limit) to the EMRI rate from observations alone. Future discoveries of QPEs and advances in their theoretical modeling will consolidate or rule out their use for constraining the number of EMRIs detectable by the LISA mission.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical model for the propagation of a structured jet in a magnetized medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a semi-analytical model that models the effects that a static magnetized medium with a tangled field produces in relativistic collimated jets. The model is a first approximation that addresses the magnetic field present in the medium and is based on pressure equilibrium principles between the jet, cocoon, and external medium. A fraction of the ambient medium field is allowed to be entrained in the cocoon. We find that the jet and cocoon properties are affected at high magnetic fields and that they are sensitive to the mixing in the cocoon. For low-mixing a slower-broader jet with a broader and more energetic cocoon would be produced. On the other hand, high-mixing would produce a faster-narrower jet with a narrow and less-energetic cocoon. Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are used to validate the model and to constrain the mixing parameter. We found good qualitative agreement between the model and the simulations. For high magnetization, the results were found to be consistent with the low mixing case of our semi-analytical model.</description>

      <title>The Mass Density of Merging Binary Black Holes Over Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and their stellar progenitors remains uncertain. Specifically, the fraction $\epsilon$ of stellar mass that ends up in BBH mergers and the delay time $\tau$ between star formation and BBH merger carry information about the astrophysical processes that give rise to merging BBHs. We model the BBH merger rate in terms of the cosmic star formation history, coupled with a metallicity-dependent efficiency $\epsilon$ and a distribution of delay times $\tau$, and infer these parameters with data from the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). We find that the progenitors to merging BBHs preferentially form in low metallicity environments with a low metallicity efficiency of $\log_{10}\epsilon_{&lt;Z_t}=-3.99^{+0.68}_{-0.87}$ and a high metallicity efficiency of $\log_{10}\epsilon_{&lt;Z_t}=-4.60^{+0.30}_{-0.34}$ at the 90% credible level. The data also prefer short delay times. For a power-law distribution $p(\tau)\propto \tau^\alpha$, we find $\tau_\text{min}&lt;1.9 $ Gyr and $\alpha&lt;-1.32$ at 90% credibility. Our model allows us to extrapolate the mass density in BBHs out to high redshifts. We cumulatively integrate our modelled density rate over cosmic time to get the total mass density of merging stellar mass BBHs as a function of redshift. Today, stellar-mass BBH mergers make up only $\sim 0.01\%$ of the total stellar mass density created by high-mass ($&gt;10\,M_\odot$) progenitors. However, because massive stars are so short-lived, there may be more mass in merging BBHs than in living massive stars as early as $\sim 2.5$ Gyr ago. We also compare to the mass in supermassive BHs, finding that the mass densities were comparable $\sim 12.5$ Gyr ago, but the mass density in SMBHs quickly increased to $\sim 75$ times the mass density in merging stellar mass BBHs by $z\sim 1$.</description>

      <title>Black hole mass estimate in OJ 287 based on the bulk-motion comptonization model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-wavelength outburst activity in the BL Lacertae source OJ 287 has sparked a lot of controversy about whether the source contains one or two black holes (BHs) and what characteristics of this black hole binary would be. In this article we present the results of analysis of the X-ray flaring activity of OJ 287 using the data of Swift/XRT observations. We discovered that the energy spectra in all spectral states can be adequately fit with the XSPEC BMC model (the Comptonization one). As a result we found that the X-ray photon index of the BMC model, $\Gamma$ correlates with the mass accretion rate, $\dot M$. We found the photon index $\Gamma$ to increase monotonically with accretion rate $\dot M$ from $\Gamma\sim 2$ in the intermediate state (IS) to $\Gamma\sim2.5$ the high/soft state (HSS) with subsequent saturation at $\Gamma\sim$ 2.6 level at higher luminosities. This type of behavior of the spectral index is remarkably similar to the pattern observed in a number of established stellar-mass black hole candidates. Assuming the universality of the observed pattern of the correlation between the photon index and mass accretion rate, we estimate the BH mass in OJ 287 to be around $2\times10^8$ solar masses, using the well studied BH binaries GX 339-4 and XTE J1859-226 to calibrate the model.</description>

      <title>Robust integration of fast flavor conversions in classical neutrino transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum kinetic evolution of neutrinos in dense environments, such as the core-collapse supernovae or the neutron star mergers, can result in fast flavor conversion (FFC), presenting a significant challenge to achieving robust astrophysical modeling of these systems. Recent works that directly simulate the quantum kinetic transport of neutrinos in localized domains have suggested that the asymptotic outcome of FFCs can be modeled by simple analytical prescriptions. In this Letter, we incorporate the analytical prescriptions into global simulations that solve the classical neutrino transport equation including collisions and advection under spherical symmetry. We demonstrate excellent agreement between results obtained using this approach and those directly from the corresponding global quantum kinetic simulations. In particular, this effective method can also precisely capture the collisional feedback effect for cases where the FFC happens inside the neutrinosphere. Our work highlights that a robust integration of FFCs in classical neutrino transport used in astrophysical simulation can be feasible.</description>

      <title>Suzaku observation of an iron K-shell line in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emission line at ~6.7 keV is attributable to a He-like iron K-shell transition, which indicates existence of a thin thermal plasma with a temperature of several keV. Using Suzaku archival data, we searched for the iron K-line from the spiral galaxy NGC 6946, and found the iron K-line at 6.68+/-0.07 keV at the 3.1 sigma level in the central r&lt;2.'5 region. The iron line luminosity from the central region was estimated to be (2.3+/-1.2)x10^{37} erg s^{-1} at a distance of 5.5 Mpc. The origin of the iron emission line is discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray Acceleration in Core-Collapse Supernova Remnants with the Wind Termination Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the attainable maximum energy of particles accelerated in the core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) shock propagating in the free wind region with the Parker-spiral magnetic field, current sheet, and the wind termination shock (WTS) by using test particle simulations. This work focuses on Wolf-Rayet stars as progenitors. The magnetic field amplification in the free wind region (shock upstream region) is not considered in this work. Test particle simulations show that particles escaped from the core-collapse SNR reach and move along the WTS, and eventually return to the SNR shock from the poles or equator of the WTS. The particle attainable energy can be boosted by this cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS and can be larger than the particle energy that is limited by escape from the SNR shock. The particle energy limited by the cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS is about $10-100~{\rm TeV}$. Thus, the core-collapse SNR without upstream magnetic field amplification can be the origin of the break around $10~{\rm TeV}$ of the energy spectrum of observed cosmic ray protons and helium.</description>

      <title>The power of relativistic jets: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a comparison between different methods to estimate the power of relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We selected a sample of 32 objects (21 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 7 BL Lacertae Objects, 2 misaligned AGN, and 2 changing-look AGN) from the Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 43 GHz of the Boston University blazar program. We then calculated the total, radiative, and kinetic jet power from both radio and high-energy gamma-ray observations, and compare the values. We found an excellent agreement between the radiative power calculated by using the Blandford and K\"onigl model with 37 or 43 GHz data, and the values derived from the high-energy $\gamma-$ray luminosity. The agreement is still acceptable if 15 GHz data are used, although with a larger dispersion, but it improves if we use a constant fraction of the $\gamma-$ray luminosity. We found a good agreement also for the kinetic power calculated with Blandford and K\"onigl model with 15 GHz data, and the value from the extended radio emission. We also propose some easy-to-use equations to estimate the jet power.</description>

      <title>Orbital variability of polarized X-ray radiation reflected from a companion star in X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reflection of X-ray radiation produced near a compact object from its stellar companion contributes to the orbital variability of polarization in X-ray binaries. The X-rays are reflected mainly via Thomson scattering resulting in a high polarization. The orbital variability of the polarization strongly depends on the inclination and the orbital parameters allowing us to constrain them. To explore this phenomenon, we present analytical single-scattering models for the polarized reflection. We find that while diluted by the direct emission, the reflection can produce a polarization degree of about 1$\%$ in the case of a large reflection albedo. We fitted the orbital variations of the X-ray polarization observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer from an accreting weakly magnetized neutron star `clocked burster' GS 1826$-$238 and found that the amplitude of the variations is too large to be primarily caused by the companion star. The polarized reflection is more significant if the compact object is obscured from the observer, and thus it should be more easily observable in certain high-inclination targets.</description>

      <title>Radiative Acceleration and X-ray Spectrum of Outflowing Pure Electron-Positron Pair Fireball in Magnetar Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One X-ray short burst accompanied by a Galactic fast radio burst has been detected so far, and its X-ray cut-off energy was significantly higher than that of other X-ray short bursts. Such X-ray bursts are thought to be emitted from a fireball in the magnetosphere of magnetars. If a fireball is formed around a magnetic pole, it expands and is accelerated under its radiation pressure, later producing photon emission and plasma outflow, which can be responsible for radio bursts. We numerically study the radiative acceleration of this outflowing fireball, which consists of electron-positron pairs and radiation, and obtain the spectrum of the escaped X-ray photons. We consistently take into account cyclotron resonant scattering, which enhances the scattering cross section resulting in a strong radiative force and high optical depth. Our results show that similar spectra to the observed X-ray spectrum in the Galactic fast radio burst are realized in outflowing fireballs and that the plasma outflow is simultaneously accelerated to a high Lorentz factor owing to cyclotron resonant scattering.</description>

      <title>Discovery and timing of ten new millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster Terzan 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of ten new pulsars in the globular cluster Terzan 5 as part of the Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) Large Survey Project. We observed Terzan 5 at L-band (856--1712 MHz) with the MeerKAT radio telescope for four hours on two epochs, and performed acceleration searches of 45 out of 288 tied-array beams covering the core of the cluster. We obtained phase-connected timing solutions for nine discoveries, covering nearly two decades of archival observations from the Green Bank Telescope for all but one. Highlights include PSR J1748$-$2446ao which is an eccentric ($e = 0.32$) wide-orbit (orbital period $P_{\rm b} = 57.55$ d) system. We were able to measure the rate of advance of periastron ($\dot{\omega}$) for this system allowing us to determine a total mass of $3.17 \pm \, 0.02\, \rm M_{\odot}$. With a minimum companion mass ($M_{\rm c}$) of $\sim 0.8\, \rm M_{\odot}$, PSR J1748$-$2446ao is a candidate double neutron star (DNS) system. If confirmed to be a DNS, it would be the fastest spinning pulsar ($P = 2.27$ ms) and the longest orbital period measured for any known DNS system. PSR J1748$-$2446ap has the second highest eccentricity for any recycled pulsar ($e \sim 0.905$) and for this system we can measure the total mass ($1.997 \pm 0.006\, \rm M_{\odot}$) and also estimate the individual pulsar and companion masses. PSR J1748$-$2446ar is an eclipsing redback (minimum $M_{\rm c} \sim 0.34\, \rm M_{\odot}$) system whose properties confirm it to be the counterpart to a previously published source identified in radio and X-ray imaging. With these discoveries, the total number of confirmed pulsars in Terzan 5 is 49, the highest for any globular cluster so far. These discoveries further enhance the rich set of pulsars known in Terzan 5 and provide scope for a deeper understanding of binary stellar evolution, cluster dynamics and ensemble population studies.</description>

      <title>The Relativistic Spin Precession in the Compact Double Neutron Star System PSR~J1946+2052</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe systematic profile changes in the visible pulsar of the compact double neutron star system PSR~J1946+2052 using observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The interpulse of PSR~J1946+2052 changed from single-peak to double-peak shape from 2018 to 2021. We attribute this evolution as the result of the relativistic spin precession of the pulsar. With the high sensitivity of FAST, we also measure significant polarization for the first time, allowing us to model this with the precessional rotating vector model. Assuming, to the first order, a circular hollow-cone-like emission beam pattern and taking the validity of general relativity, we derive the binary's orbital inclination angle (${63^\circ}^{+5^\circ}_{-3^\circ}$) and pulsar's spin geometry. Pulsar's spin vector and the orbital angular momentum vector are found to be only slightly misaligned (${0.21^\circ}^{+0.28^\circ}_{-0.10^\circ}$).The quoted uncertainties do not reflect the systematic uncertainties introduced by our model assumptions. By simulating future observations of profile and polarization evolution, we estimate that we could constrain the precession rate within a $43\%$ uncertainty in 9 years. Hence, we suggest that the system's profile evolution could be combined with precise pulsar timing to test general relativity in the future.</description>

      <title>X-ray Properties of the Luminous Quasar PG 1634+706 at z = 1.337 from SRG and XMM-Newton Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fall of 2019, during the in-flight calibration phase of the SRG observatory, the onboard eROSITA and Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescopes carried out a series of observations of PG 1634+706 - one of the most luminous (an X-ray luminosity $\sim 10^{46}$ erg/s) quasars in the Universe at $z&lt;2$. Approximately at the same dates this quasar was also observed by the XMM-Newton observatory. Although the object had already been repeatedly studied in X-rays previously, its new observations allowed its energy spectrum to be measured more accurately in the wide range $1-30$ keV (in the quasar rest frame). Its spectrum can be described by a two-component model that consists of a power-law continuum with a slope $\Gamma\approx 1.9$ and a broadened iron emission line at an energy of about 6.4 keV. The X-ray variability of the quasar was also investigated. On time scales of the order of several hours (here and below, in the source rest frame) the X-ray luminosity does not exhibit a statistically significant variability. However, it changed noticeably from observation to observation in the fall of 2019, having increased approximately by a factor of 1.5 in 25 days. A comparison of the new SRG and XMM-Newton measurements with the previous measurements of other X-ray observatories has shown that in the entire 17-year history of observations of the quasar PG 1634+706 its X-ray luminosity has varied by no more than a factor of 2.5, while the variations on time scales of several weeks and several years are comparable in amplitude.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups as the ultimate probe of AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The co-evolution between supermassive black holes and their environment is most directly traced by the hot atmospheres of dark matter halos. Cooling of the hot atmosphere supplies the central regions with fresh gas, igniting active galactic nuclei (AGN) with long duty cycles. Outflows from the central engine tightly couple with the surrounding gaseous medium and provide the dominant heating source preventing runaway cooling. Every major modern hydrodynamical simulation suite now includes a prescription for AGN feedback to reproduce realistic populations of galaxies. However, the mechanisms governing the feeding/feedback cycle between the central black holes and their surrounding galaxies and halos are still poorly understood. Galaxy groups are uniquely suited to constrain the mechanisms governing the cooling-heating balance, as the energy supplied by the central AGN can exceed the gravitational binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we provide a brief overview of our knowledge of the impact of AGN on the hot atmospheres of galaxy groups, with a specific focus on the thermodynamic profiles of groups. We then present our on-going efforts to improve on the implementation of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution models by providing precise benchmarks on the properties of galaxy groups. We introduce the \XMM~ Group AGN Project (X-GAP), a large program on \XMM~ targeting a sample of 49 galaxy groups out to $R_{500c}$.</description>

      <title>Stellar Spin Down in Post-Mass Transfer Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by measurements of the rotation speed of accretor stars in post-mass-transfer (post-MT) systems, we investigate how magnetic braking affects the spin-down of individual stars during binary evolution with the \texttt{MESAbinary} module. Unlike the conventional assumption of tidal synchronization coupled with magnetic braking in binaries, we first calculate whether tides are strong enough to synchronize the orbit. Subsequently, this influences the spin-down of stars and the orbital separation. In this study, we apply four magnetic braking prescriptions to reduce the spin angular momentum of the two stars throughout the entire binary evolution simulation. Our findings reveal that despite magnetic braking causing continuous spin-down of the accretor, when the donor begins to transfer material onto the accretor, the accretor can rapidly spin up to its critical rotation rate. After MT, magnetic braking becomes more important in affecting the angular momentum evolution of the stars. Post-MT accretor stars thus serve as a valuable testbed for observing how the magnetic braking prescriptions operate in spinning down stars from their critical rotation, including the saturation regimes of the magnetic braking. The rotation rate of the accretor star, combined with its mass, could provide age information since the cessation of MT. By comparing the models against observation, the magnetic braking prescription by Garraffo et al. (2018b) is found to better align with the rotation data of post-MT accretors.</description>

      <title>Rapid neutron star equation of state inference with Normalising Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars on the 17th of August, 2017, (GW170817) heralded the arrival of a new messenger for probing neutron star astrophysics and provided the first constraints on neutron star equation of state from gravitational wave observations. Significant computational effort was expended to obtain these first results and therefore, as observations of binary neutron star coalescence become more routine in the coming observing runs, there is a need to improve the analysis speed and flexibility. Here, we present a rapid approach for inferring the neutron star equation of state based on Normalising Flows. As a demonstration, using the same input data, our approach, ASTREOS, produces results consistent with those presented by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration but requires &lt; 1 sec to generate neutron star equation of state confidence intervals. Furthermore, ASTREOS allows for non-parametric equation of state inference. This rapid analysis will not only facilitate neutron star equation of state studies but can potentially enhance future alerts for electromagnetic follow-up observations of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent nuclear energy-density functional theory toolkit for neutron star crust: Dynamics of a nucleus in a neutron superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new numerical tool designed to probe the dense layers of neutron star crusts. It is based on the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with generalized Skyrme nuclear energy density functionals, such as the Brussels-Montreal ones. We use it to study the time evolution of a nucleus accelerating through superfluid neutron medium in the inner crust of a neutron star. We extract an effective mass in the low velocity limit. We observe a threshold velocity and specify mechanisms of dissipation: phonon emission, Cooper pairs breaking, and vortex rings creation. The microscopic effects we study have impact on neutron star. Moreover, the mechanisms, we described, are general and apply also to other fermionic superfluid mixtures like liquid helium, or ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>The Unified Era: An understanding journey from observations to the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (UMAGN) is a comprehensive theoretical framework aimed at elucidating the diverse observations of AGN, encompassing quasars and Seyfert galaxies. The Model attributes the observed variations to different orientations of a surrounding matter disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH), with the primary factor influencing observational diversity being the alignment of the AGN with the observer's line of sight. We present a comprehensive overview of the observational evidence, empirical and theoretical research, tracing key milestones that led to a unified perspective. We encapsulate the scientific journey culminating in the proposal of the UMAGN, including insights into the accretion disk, torus, and relativistic jet, and emphasize the properties of objects within UMAGN. Additionally, we underscore recent progress in multimessenger research involving electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves, astroparticles, and neutrinos, notably through collaborations such as the Event Horizon Telescope, LIGO/Virgo, IceCube, Pierre Auger, and KM3Net. We argue that these advancements present opportunities to enhance and refine UMAGN, contributing to a deeper understanding of AGNs and their implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. The convergence of observational and theoretical research, coupled with emerging multimessenger techniques, paves the way for further strides in comprehending these enigmatic cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse of White Dwarfs to Neutron Stars. I. From Initial Conditions to Explosions with Neutrino-radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides collapses of massive, fully convective, and non-rotating white dwarfs (WDs) formed by accretion-induced collapse or merger-induced collapse and the subsequent explosions with the general relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We produce initial WDs in hydrostatic equilibrium, which have super-Chandrasekhar mass and are about to collapse. The WDs have masses of 1.6$M_\odot$ with different initial central densities specifically at $10^{10}$, $10^{9.6}$, $10^{9.3}$ and $10^{9.0}\,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}$. First, we check whether initial WDs are stable without weak interactions. Second, we calculate the collapse of WDs with weak interactions. We employ hydrodynamics simulations with Newtonian gravity in the first and second steps. Third, we calculate the formation of neutron stars and accompanying explosions with general relativistic simulations. As a result, WDs with the highest density of $10^{10}\,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}$ collapse not by weak interactions but by the photodissociation of the iron, and three WDs with low central densities collapse by the electron capture as expected at the second step and succeed in the explosion with a small explosion energy of $\sim 10^{48}$ erg at the third step. By changing the surrounding environment of WDs, we find that there is a minimum value of ejecta masses being $\sim 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$. With the most elaborate simulations of this kind so far, the value is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported values and is compatible with the estimated ejecta mass from FRB~121102.</description>

      <title>First Digit Distributions of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of the first significant digits from real world sources is usually not equally distributed, but is consistent with a logarithmic distribution instead, known as Benford's law. In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation on the first digit distributions of the duration, fluence, and energy flux of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for the first time. For a complete GRB sample detected by the Fermi satellite, we find that the first digits of the duration and fluence adhere to Benford's law. However, the energy flux shows a significant departure from this law, which may be due to the fact that a considerable part of the energy flux measurements are restricted by lack of spectral information. Based on the conventional duration classification scheme, we also check if the durations and fluences of long and short GRBs (with duration $T_{90}&gt;2$ s and $T_{90}\leq2$ s, respectively) obey Benford's law. We find that the fluences of both long and short GRBs still agree with the Benford distribution, but their durations do not follow Benford's law. Our results hint that the long--short GRB classification scheme does not directly represent the intrinsic physical classification scheme.</description>

      <title>Observation of Seven Astrophysical Tau Neutrino Candidates with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a measurement of astrophysical tau neutrinos with 9.7 years of IceCube data. Using convolutional neural networks trained on images derived from simulated events, seven candidate $\nu_\tau$ events were found with visible energies ranging from roughly 20 TeV to 1 PeV and a median expected parent $\nu_\tau$ energy of about 200 TeV. Considering backgrounds from astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos, and muons from $\pi^\pm/K^\pm$ decays in atmospheric air showers, we obtain a total estimated background of about 0.5 events, dominated by non-$\nu_\tau$ astrophysical neutrinos. Thus, we rule out the absence of astrophysical $\nu_\tau$ at the $5\sigma$ level. The measured astrophysical $\nu_\tau$ flux is consistent with expectations based on previously published IceCube astrophysical neutrino flux measurements and neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Measurements of All-Particle Energy Spectrum and Mean Logarithmic Mass of Cosmic Rays from 0.3 to 30 PeV with LHAASO-KM2A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the measurements of all-particle energy spectrum and mean logarithmic mass of cosmic rays in the energy range of 0.3-30 PeV using data collected from LHAASO-KM2A between September 2021 and December 2022, which is based on a nearly composition-independent energy reconstruction method, achieving unprecedented accuracy. Our analysis reveals the position of the knee at $3.67 \pm 0.05 \pm 0.15$ PeV. Below the knee, the spectral index is found to be -$2.7413 \pm 0.0004 \pm 0.0050$, while above the knee, it is -$3.128 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.027$, with the sharpness of the transition measured with a statistical error of 2%. The mean logarithmic mass of cosmic rays is almost heavier than helium in the whole measured energy range. It decreases from 1.7 at 0.3 PeV to 1.3 at 3 PeV, representing a 24% decline following a power law with an index of -$0.1200 \pm 0.0003 \pm 0.0341$. This is equivalent to an increase in abundance of light components. Above the knee, the mean logarithmic mass exhibits a power law trend towards heavier components, which is reversal to the behavior observed in the all-particle energy spectrum. Additionally, the knee position and the change in power-law index are approximately the same. These findings suggest that the knee observed in the all-particle spectrum corresponds to the knee of the light component, rather than the medium-heavy components.</description>

      <title>The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot Survey: V. PSR J1901+0658 in a double neutron star system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double neutron star (DNS) systems offer excellent opportunities to test gravity theories. We report the timing results of PSR J1901+0658, the first pulsar discovered in the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey. Based on timing observations by FAST over 5 years, we obtain the phase-coherent timing solutions and derive the precise measurements of its position, spin parameters, orbital parameters, and dispersion measure (DM). It has a period of 75.7 ms, a period derivative of 2.169(6)$\times 10^{-19}$ s s$^{-1}$, and a characteristic age of 5.5 Gyr. This pulsar is in an orbit with a period of 14.45 days and an eccentricity of 0.366. One post-Keplerian parameter, periastron advance, has been well measured as being 0.00531(9) deg/yr, from which the total mass of this system is derived to be 2.79(7) $M_{\odot}$. The pulsar has the mass upper limit of 1.68 $M_{\odot}$, so the lower limit for the companion mass is 1.11 $M_{\odot}$. Because PSR J1901+0658 is a partially recycled pulsar in an eccentric binary orbit with such a large companion mass, it should be in a DNS system according to the evolution history of the binary system.</description>

      <title>The Accuracy of Neutron Star Radius Measurement with the Next Generation of Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the prospect for improving the measurement accuracy of masses and radii of neutron stars. We consider imminent and long-term upgrades of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo, as well as next-generation observatories -- the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. We find that neutron star radius with single events will be constrained to within roughly 500m with the current generation of detectors and their upgrades. This will improve to 200m, 100m and 50m with a network of observatories that contain one, two or three next-generation observatories, respectively. Combining events in bins of 0.05 solar masses we find that for stiffer (softer) equations-of-state like ALF2 (APR4), a network of three XG observatories will determine the radius to within 30m (100m) over the entire mass range of neutron stars from 1 to 2.0 solar masses (2.2 solar masses), allowed by the respective equations-of-state. Neutron star masses will be measured to within 0.5 percent with three XG observatories irrespective of the actual equation-of-state. Measurement accuracies will be a factor of 4 or 2 worse if the network contains only one or two XG observatories, respectively, and a factor of 10 worse in the case of networks consisting of Advanced LIGO, Virgo KAGRA and their upgrades. Tens to hundreds of high-fidelity events detected by future observatories will allow us to accurately measure the mass-radius curve and hence determine the dense matter equation-of-state to exquisite precision.</description>

      <title>Estimating Astrophysical Population Properties using a multi-component Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent start of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has reopened the hunt for gravitational-wave (GW) signals, with one compact-binary-coalescence (CBC) signal expected to be observed every few days. Among the signals that could be detected for the first time there is the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from the superposition of unresolvable GW signals that cannot be detected individually. In fact, multiple SGWBs are likely to arise given the variety of sources, making it crucial to identify the dominant components and assess their origin. However, most search methods with ground-based detectors assume the presence of one SGWB component at a time, which could lead to biased results in estimating its spectral shape if multiple SGWBs exist. Therefore, a joint estimate of the components is necessary. In this work, we adapt such an approach and analyse the data from the first three LVK observing runs, searching for a multi-component isotropic SGWB. We do not find evidence for any SGWB and establish upper limits on the dimensionless energy parameter $\Omega_{\rm gw}(f)$ at 25 Hz for five different power-law spectral indices, $\alpha = 0, \, 2/3,\, 2,\, 3,\, 4$, jointly. For the spectral indices $\alpha = 2/3,\, 2, \, 4$, corresponding to astrophysical SGWBs from CBCs, r-mode instabilities in young rotating neutron stars, and magnetars, we draw further astrophysical implications by constraining the ensemble parameters $K_{\rm CBC}, \, K_{\rm r-modes}, \, K_{\rm magnetars}$, defined in the main text.</description>

      <title>Dark Branes for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 10$~GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 2$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

      <title>QED Effects on Kerr-Newman Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>

      <title>Effect of Deviations from General Relativity on Searches for Gravitational Wave Microlensing and Type II Strong Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the gravitational wave detector network is upgraded and the sensitivity of the detectors improves, novel scientific avenues open for exploration. For example, tests of general relativity will become more accurate as smaller deviations can be probed. Additionally, the detection of lensed gravitational waves becomes more likely. However, these new avenues could also interact with each other, and a gravitational wave event presenting deviations from general relativity could be mistaken for a lensed one. Here, we explore how phenomenological deviations from general relativity or binaries of exotic compact objects could impact those lensing searches focusing on a single event. We consider strong lensing, millilensing, and microlensing and find that certain phenomenological deviations from general relativity may be mistaken for all of these types of lensing. Therefore, our study shows that future candidate lensing events would need to be carefully examined to avoid a false claim of lensing where instead a deviation from general relativity has been seen.</description>
