      <title>Double Robustness of Local Projections and Some Unpleasant VARithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider impulse response inference in a locally misspecified stationary vector autoregression (VAR) model. The conventional local projection (LP) confidence interval has correct coverage even when the misspecification is so large that it can be detected with probability approaching 1. This follows from a "double robustness" property analogous to that of modern estimators for partially linear regressions. In contrast, VAR confidence intervals dramatically undercover even for misspecification so small that it is difficult to detect statistically and cannot be ruled out based on economic theory. This is because of a "no free lunch" result for VARs: the worst-case bias and coverage distortion are small if, and only if, the variance is close to that of LP. While VAR coverage can be restored by using a bias-aware critical value or a large lag length, the resulting confidence interval tends to be at least as wide as the LP interval.</description>

      <title>Identifying Heterogeneous Decision Rules From Choices When Menus Are Unobserved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given only aggregate choice data and limited information about how menus are distributed across the population, we describe what can be inferred robustly about the distribution of preferences (or more general decision rules). We strengthen and generalize existing results on such identification and provide an alternative analytical approach to study the problem. We show further that our model and results are applicable, after suitable reinterpretation, to other contexts. One application is to the robust identification of the distribution of updating rules given only the population distribution of beliefs and limited information about heterogeneous information sources.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Unbiased Synthetic Control Methods by Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic Control Methods (SCMs) have become an essential tool for comparative case studies. The fundamental idea of SCMs is to estimate the counterfactual outcomes of a treated unit using a weighted sum of the observed outcomes of untreated units. The accuracy of the synthetic control (SC) is critical for evaluating the treatment effect of a policy intervention; therefore, the estimation of SC weights has been the focus of extensive research. In this study, we first point out that existing SCMs suffer from an endogeneity problem, the correlation between the outcomes of untreated units and the error term of the synthetic control, which yields a bias in the treatment effect estimator. We then propose a novel SCM based on density matching, assuming that the density of outcomes of the treated unit can be approximated by a weighted average of the joint density of untreated units (i.e., a mixture model). Based on this assumption, we estimate SC weights by matching the moments of treated outcomes with the weighted sum of moments of untreated outcomes. Our proposed method has three advantages over existing methods: first, our estimator is asymptotically unbiased under the assumption of the mixture model; second, due to the asymptotic unbiasedness, we can reduce the mean squared error in counterfactual predictions; third, our method generates full densities of the treatment effect, not merely expected values, which broadens the applicability of SCMs. We provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Estimating Individual Responses when Tomorrow Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a regression-based approach to estimate how individuals' expectations influence their responses to a counterfactual change. We provide conditions under which average partial effects based on regression estimates recover structural effects. We propose a practical three-step estimation method that relies on panel data on subjective expectations. We illustrate our approach in a model of consumption and saving, focusing on the impact of an income tax that not only changes current income but also affects beliefs about future income. Applying our approach to Italian survey data, we find that individuals' beliefs matter for evaluating the impact of tax policies on consumption decisions.</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning for Static Panel Models with Fixed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in causal inference have seen the development of methods which make use of the predictive power of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we use double machine learning (DML) (Chernozhukov et al., 2018) to approximate high-dimensional and non-linear nuisance functions of the confounders to make inferences about the effects of policy interventions from panel data. We propose new estimators by adapting correlated random effects, within-group and first-difference estimation for linear models to an extension of Robinson (1988)'s partially linear regression model to static panel data models with individual fixed effects and unspecified non-linear confounder effects. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the relative performance of different machine learning algorithms and find that conventional least squares estimators performs well when the data generating process is mildly non-linear and smooth, but there are substantial performance gains with DML in terms of bias reduction when the true effect of the regressors is non-linear and discontinuous. However, inference based on individual learners can lead to badly biased inference. Finally, we provide an illustrative example of DML for observational panel data showing the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on voting behavior in the UK.</description>
