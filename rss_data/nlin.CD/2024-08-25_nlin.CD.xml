      <title>Resolvent-Based Optimisation for Approximating the Statistics of Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximating the statistical properties of turbulent flows by combining variational methods for the search of unstable periodic orbits with resolvent analysis for dimensionality reduction. Traditional approaches relying on identifying all short, fundamental Unstable Periodic Orbits to compute ergodic averages via cycle expansion are computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional fluid systems. Our framework stems from the observation in Lasagna, Phys. Rev. E (2020), that a single unstable periodic orbit with a period sufficiently long to span a large fraction of the attractor captures the statistical properties of chaotic trajectories. Given the difficulty of identifying unstable periodic orbits for high-dimensional fluid systems, approximate trajectories residing in a low-dimensional subspace are instead constructed using resolvent modes, which inherently capture the temporal periodicity of unstable periodic orbits. The amplitude coefficients of these modes are adjusted iteratively with gradient-based optimisation to minimise the violation of the projected governing equations, producing trajectories that approximate, rather than exactly solve, the system dynamics. A first attempt at utilising this framework on a chaotic system is made here on the Lorenz 1963 equations, where resolvent analysis enables an exact dimensionality reduction from three to two dimensions. Key observables averaged over these trajectories produced by the approach as well as probability distributions and spectra rapidly converge to values obtained from long chaotic simulations, even with a limited number of iterations. This indicates that exact solutions may not necessary to approximate the system's statistical behaviour, as the trajectories obtained from partial optimisation provide a sufficient ``sketch'' of the attractor in state space.</description>

      <title>Attractive-repulsive interaction in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of quantum self-sustained oscillators induced by the simultaneous presence of attraction and repulsion in the coupling path. We consider quantum Stuart-Landau oscillators under attractive-repulsive coupling and construct the corresponding quantum master equation in the Lindblad form. We discover an interesting symmetry-breaking transition from quantum limit cycle oscillation to quantum inhomogeneous steady state; This transition is contrary to the previously known symmetry-breaking transition from quantum homogeneous to inhomogeneous steady state. The result is supported by the analysis on the noisy classical model of the quantum system in the weak quantum regime. Remarkably, we find the generation of entanglement associated with the symmetry-breaking transition that has no analogue in the classical domain. This study will enrich our understanding of the collective behaviors shown by coupled oscillators in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Role of Coupling Asymmetry in the Fully Disordered Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of phase oscillators in the fully disordered Kuramoto model with couplings of defined asymmetry. The mean-field dynamics is reduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we analyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence of the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well as on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition is shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but to disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Local and nonlocal stochastic control of quantum chaos: Measurement- and control-induced criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the topology of the phase diagram of a family of quantum models inspired by the classical Bernoulli map under stochastic control. The quantum models inherit a control-induced phase transition from the classical model and also manifest an entanglement phase transition intrinsic to the quantum setting. This measurement-induced phase transition has been shown in various settings to either coincide or split off from the control transition, but a systematic understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the two transitions to coincide in this case has so far been lacking. In this work, we generalize the control map to allow for either local or global control action. While this does not affect the classical aspects of the control transition that is described by a random walk, it significantly influences the quantum dynamics, leading to the universality class of the measurement-induced transition being dependent on the locality of the control operation. In the presence of a global control map, the two transitions coincide and the control-induced phase transition dominates the measurement-induced phase transition. Contrarily, the two transitions split in the presence of the local control map or additional projective measurements and generically take on distinct universality classes. For local control, the measurement-induced phase transition recovers the Haar logarithmic conformal field theory universality class found in feedback-free models. However, for global control, a novel universality class with correlation length exponent $\nu \approx 0.7$ emerges from the interplay of control and projective measurements. This work provides a more refined understanding of the relationship between the control- and measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>
