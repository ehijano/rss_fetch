      <title>Finite steady-state current defies non-Hermitian many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian many-body localization (NH MBL) has emerged as a possible scenario for stable localization in open systems, as suggested by spectral indicators identifying a putative transition for finite system sizes.
  In this work, we shift the focus to dynamical probes, specifically the steady-state spin current, to investigate transport properties in a disordered, non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. Through exact diagonalization for small systems and tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the steady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder strength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond the previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy between spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport behavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of dynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional spectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems.
  Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and time, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies. These findings challenge the existence of NH MBL in the studied model and underscore the need for alternative approaches to understand localization in non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic entanglement lightcone from eigenstate correlations in the many-body localised phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the operator entanglement of the time-evolution operator through the framework of eigenstate correlations. Focusing on strongly disordered quantum many-body systems in the many-body localised (MBL) regime, we analyse the operator entanglement across various spatiotemporal cuts, revealing the logarithmic lightcone of entanglement spreading. We demonstrate that this logarithmic lightcone arises directly from a hierarchy of energyscales and lengthscales encoded in eigenstate correlations. By characterising the statistics of these hierarchical scales, we develop a microscopic theory for the spatiotemporal structure of entanglement spreading in MBL systems -- without invoking phenomenological constructs such as $\ell$-bits. This approach reveals the fundamental connection between eigenstate correlations and the emergent entanglement structure in MBL systems.</description>

      <title>Super diffusive length dependent thermal conductivity in one-dimensional materials with structural defects: longitudinal to transverse phonon scattering leads to $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural defects in one-dimensional heat conductors couple longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending) vibrations. This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as $\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ($\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal conductivity depending on the size as $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, though the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also be significant.</description>

      <title>RAFFLE: Active learning accelerated interface structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfaces between materials play a crucial role in the performance of most devices. However, predicting the structure of a material interface is computationally demanding due to the vast configuration space, which requires evaluating an unfeasibly large number of highly complex structures. We introduce RAFFLE, a software package designed to efficiently explore low-energy interface configurations between any two crystals. RAFFLE leverages physical insights and genetic algorithms to intelligently sample the configuration space, using dynamically evolving 2-, 3-, and 4-body distribution functions as generalised structural descriptors. These descriptors are iteratively updated through active learning, which inform atom placement strategies. RAFFLE's effectiveness is demonstrated across a diverse set of systems, including bulk materials, intercalation structures, and interfaces. When tested on bulk aluminium and MoS$_2$, it successfully identifies known ground-state and high-pressure phases. Applied to intercalation systems, it predicts stable intercalant phases. For Si|Ge interfaces, RAFFLE identifies intermixing as a strain compensation mechanism, generating reconstructions that are more stable than abrupt interfaces. By accelerating interface structure prediction, RAFFLE offers a powerful tool for materials discovery, enabling efficient exploration of complex configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced ``sharpening'' phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known charge-sharpening transition for diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamics on the picosecond timescale in a superconducting synapse structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are running into limitations in terms of training time and energy. Following the principles of the human brain, spiking neural networks trained with unsupervised learning offer a faster, more energy-efficient alternative. However, the dynamics of spiking, learning, and forgetting become more complicated in such schemes. Here we study a superconducting electronics implementation of a learning synapse and experimentally measure its spiking dynamics. By pulsing the system with a superconducting neuron, we show that a superconducting inductor can dynamically hold the synaptic weight with updates due to learning and forgetting. Learning can be stopped by slowing down the arrival time of the post-synaptic pulse, in accordance with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity paradigm. We find excellent agreement with circuit simulations, and by fitting the turn-on of the pulsing frequency, we confirm a learning time of 16.1 +/- 1 ps. The power dissipation in the learning part of the synapse is less than one attojoule per learning event. This leads to the possibility of an extremely fast and energy-efficient learning processor.</description>

      <title>The odd-even effect of mosaic modulation period of quasi-periodic hopping on the Anderson localization in a one-dimensional lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate Anderson localization in a one-dimensional lattice with a mosaic off-diagonal quasiperiodic hopping. Our findings reveal that the localization behavior of zero-energy states is highly dependent on the parity of the mosaic modulation period, denoted as $\kappa$. Specifically, when $\kappa$ is an odd integer, there is no Anderson localization transition even for large quasiperiodic hopping strengths, and the zero-energy state remains in a critical state. On the other hand, for an even $\kappa$ and a generic quasiperiodic hopping, the zero-energy state becomes a localized edge state at either the left or right end of the system. Additionally, we observe that the geometric mean value of the energy spectrum is equal to the constant hopping for an even $\kappa$, while for an odd $\kappa$, it is equal to the geometric mean value of the hopping. This odd-even effect of the mosaic period also extends to other eigenstates near zero energy. More specifically, for an odd $\kappa$, there exists an energy window in which the eigenstates remain critical even for strong quasiperiodic hopping. In contrast, for an even $\kappa$, an Anderson localization transition occurs as the hopping strength increases. Furthermore, we are able to accurately determine the Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and the mobility edges $E_c$. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponent, we identify critical regions in the hopping-energy parameter planes. Additionally, as the energy approaches the mobility edges, we observe a critical index of localization length of $\nu=1$. Finally, we demonstrate that different systems can be characterized by their Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and Avila's acceleration $\omega(E)$.</description>

      <title>A numerical study of the localization transition of Aubry-Andr\'{e} type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use tools based on the modern theory of polarization for a numerical study of the localization transition of the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model. In this model the spatial modulation of the potential, $\alpha$, is an irrational number, which we approximate as the ratio of Fibonacci numbers, $F_{n+1}/F_n$, where $F_n=L$ is also the system size. We calculate the phase diagram as a function of particle density (filling) and potential strength $W$. We calculate the geometric Binder cumulant and also apply a renormalization approach. At any given finite system size we find that at many densities the transition occurs at or near $W=2t$ ($t$ denotes the hopping). This is where single particle states are known to localize. However, we also find "spikes", densites at which the transition occurs in the range $0&lt;W&lt;2t$. These spikes occur for densities at which there are no partially filled bands. As the system size (and both $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ in $\alpha$) is increased the spikes tend towards zero, but the density at which they occur also changes slightly: they approach irrational numbers which can be written as Fibonacci ratios or sums thereof. For densities which are fixed ratios for all system sizes, the transition occurs at $W=2t$. We also study an extension of the original Aubry-Andr\'{e} model with second nearest neighbor hoppings. This model also exhibits a distorted phase diagram compared to the original one, with spikes which do not necessarily tend to zero, but to finite values of $W$, determined by the modifed gap structure.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for the electrical conductivity of random metallic nanowire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in studying the conductive properties of networks made from randomly distributed nanowires is due to their numerous technological applications. Although the sheet resistance of such networks can be calculated directly, the calculations require many characteristics of the system (distributions of lengths, diameters and resistances of nanowires, distribution of junction resistance), the measurement of which is difficult. Furthermore, such calculations can hardly offer an analytical dependence of the sheet resistance on the basic physical parameters of the systems under consideration. Although various theoretical approaches offer such analytical dependencies, they are often based on more or less reasonable assumptions rather than rigorously proven statements. Here, we offer an approach based on Foster's theorem to reveal a dependence of the sheet resistance of dense nanowire networks on the main parameters of such networks. This theorem offers an additional perspective on the effective medium theory and extends our insight. Since the application of Foster's theorem is particularly effective for regular random resistor networks, we propose a method for regularizing resistor networks corresponding to random nanowire networks. We found an analytical dependence of the effective electrical conductivity on the main parameters of the nanowire network (reduced number density of nanowires, nanowire resistance, and resistance of contacts between nanowires).</description>

      <title>Minimal cyclic behavior in sheared amorphous solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although jammed packings of soft spheres exist in potential energy landscapes with a vast number of minima, when subjected to cyclic shear they may revisit the same configurations repeatedly. Simple hysteretic spin models, in which particle rearrangements are represented by interacting spin flips called hysterons, capture many features of this periodic behavior. Yet it has been unclear to what extent individual rearrangements can be described by such binary objects and how such objects interact with one another. Using a particularly sensitive algorithm, we identify rearrangements in simulated jammed packings and select pairs of rearrangements that undo one another to create periodic cyclic behavior. We find that the rearrangement pairs surprisingly persist down to the smallest increments in strain, even in the smallest systems we can study. We explore the statistics of these rearrangement pairs and find that there is a relation between the amount of hysteresis and the energy drop and mean-square displacement of the particles; these results are inconsistent with the scaling found in models that treat rearrangements as localized buckling events. Finally, our analysis shows that there is no clean distinction between the "core" of an individual rearrangement and the interactions between rearrangements. These results offer insight into how complex systems such as amorphous solids can reach a limit cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel entropy-related function, \textit{non-repeatability}, designed to capture dynamical behaviors in complex systems. Its normalized form, \textit{mutability}, has been previously applied in statistical physics as a dynamical entropy measure. To present the scope and advantages of these quantities, we analyze two distinct systems: (a) Monte Carlo simulations of magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) seismic time series from the United States Geological Survey catalog. Both systems are well-established in the literature, serving as robust benchmarks. Shannon entropy is employed as a reference point to assess the similarities and differences with the proposed measures. A key distinction lies in the sensitivity of non-repeatability and mutability to the temporal ordering of data, which contrasts with traditional entropy definitions. Moreover, \textit{sorted mutability} -- the mutability computed from a reordered data version -- reveals additional insights into the critical behavior of the systems under study.</description>

Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>
