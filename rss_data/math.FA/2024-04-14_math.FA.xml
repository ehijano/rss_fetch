      <title>Higher order $\mathcal{S}^{p}$-differentiability: The unitary case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the set of unitary operators on a complex separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, denoted as $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$. Consider $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We establish that $f$ is $n$ times continuously Fr\'echet $\mathcal{S}^{p}$-differentiable at every point in $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$ if and only if $f\in C^n(\mathbb{T})$. Take $U :\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$ such that $\tilde{U}:t\in\mathbb{R}\mapsto U(t)-U(0)$ is $n$ times continuously $\mathcal{S}^p$-differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$. Consequently, for $f\in C^n(\mathbb{T})$, we prove that $f$ is $n$ times continuously G\^ateaux $\mathcal{S}^p$-differentiable at $U(t)$. We provide explicit expressions for both types of derivatives of $f$ in terms of multiple operator integrals. In the domain of unitary operators, these results closely follow the $n$th order successes for self-adjoint operators achieved by the second author, Le Merdy, Skripka, and Sukochev. Furthermore, as for application, we derive a formula and $\mathcal{S}^{p}$-estimates for operator Taylor remainders for a broader class of functions. Our results extend those of Peller, Potapov, Skripka, Sukochev and Tomskova.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study geometric properties of $\ell^{p}$-spaces associated with the unitary dual of a compact group.

      <description>arXiv:2404.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criteria for an algebraic operator $T$ on a complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ to be unitary are established. The main one is written in terms of the convergence of sequences of the form $\{\|T^nh\|\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ with $h\in \mathcal{H}$. Related questions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Stabilities in Banach spaces with skew-adjoint Fredholm operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the stability theorems for the isotropic perturbations of Lagrangian subspaces and maximal isotropic subspaces in strong symplectic Banach spaces. Then we prove a stability theorem for the mod $2$ dimensions of kernel of skew-adjoint Fredholm linear relations between real Banach spaces with index $0$. Finally we gives the path components of the set of skew-adjoint Fredholm linear relations between real Banach spaces with indices $0$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of power sequences of operators via their stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the convergence of power sequences and stability of Hilbert space operators, where "convergence" and "stability" refer to weak, strong and norm topologies. It is proved that an operator has a convergent power sequence if and only if it is a (not necessarily orthogonal) direct sum of an identity operator and a stable operator. This reduces the issue of convergence of the power sequence of an operator $T$ to the study of stability of $T$. The question of when the limit of the power sequence is an orthogonal projection is investigated. Among operators sharing this property are hyponormal and contractive ones. In particular, a hyponormal or a contractive operator with no identity part is stable if and only if its power sequence is convergent. In turn, a unitary operator has a weakly convergent power sequence if and only if its singular-continuous part is weakly stable and its singular-discrete part is the identity. Characterizations of the convergence of power sequences and stability of subnormal operators are given in terms of semispectral measures.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Hardy inequalities on metric measure spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Hardy inequality with bilinear operators on general metric measure spaces. We give the characterization of weights for the bilinear Hardy inequality to hold on general metric measure spaces having polar decompositions. We also provide several examples of the results, finding conditions on the weights for integral Hardy inequalities on homogeneous Lie groups, as well as on hyperbolic spaces and more generally on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi: B_d\to\mathbb{D}$, $d\ge 1$, be a holomorphic function, where $B_d$ denotes the open unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^d$ and $\mathbb{D}= B_1$. Let $\Theta: \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{D}$ be an inner function and let $K^p_\Theta$ denote the corresponding model space. For $p&gt;1$, we characterize the compact composition operators $C_\varphi: K^p_\Theta \to H^p(B_d)$, where $H^p(B_d)$ denotes the Hardy space.</description>

      <title>On the structure of graph product von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive study of structural properties of graph products of von Neumann algebras equipped with faithful, normal states, as well as properties of the graph products relative to subalgebras coming from induced subgraphs. Among the technical contributions in this paper include a complete bimodule calculation for subalgebras arising from subgraphs. As an application, we obtain a complete classification of when two subalgebras coming from induced subgraphs can be amenable relative to each other. We also give complete characterizations of when the graph product can be full, diffuse, or a factor. Our results are obtained in a broad generality, and we emphasize that they are new even in the tracial setting. They also allow us to deduce new results about when graph products of groups can be amenable relative to each other.</description>

      <title>A general functional version of Gr\"unbaum's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical inequality by Gr\"unbaum provides a sharp lower bound for the ratio $\mathrm{vol}(K^{-})/\mathrm{vol}(K)$, where $K^{-}$ denotes the intersection of a convex body with non-empty interior $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with a halfspace bounded by a hyperplane $H$ passing through the centroid $\mathrm{g}(K)$ of $K$.
  In this paper we extend this result to the case in which the hyperplane $H$ passes by any of the points lying in a whole uniparametric family of $r$-powered centroids associated to $K$ (depending on a real parameter $r\geq0$), by proving a more general functional result on concave functions.
  The latter result further connects (and allows one to recover) various inequalities involving the centroid, such as a classical inequality (due to Minkowski and Radon) that relates the distance of $\mathrm{g}(K)$ to a supporting hyperplane of $K$, or a result for volume sections of convex bodies proven independently by Makai Jr. &amp; Martini and Fradelizi.</description>

      <title>Optimal Domain of generalized Volterra operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For g in BMOA, we consider the generalized Volterra operator T_g acting on Hardy spaces H^p. This article aims to study the largest space of analytic functions, which is mapped by T_g into the Hardy space H^p. We call this space the optimal domain of T_g and we describe its structural properties. Motivation for this comes from the work of G. Curbera and W. Ricker who studied the optimal domain of the classical Ces\'aro operator.</description>

      <title>Differentiation of resultants and common roots of pairs of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-known mathematical instrument for detection common roots for pairs of polynomials and multiple roots of polynomials are resultants and discriminants. For a pair of polynomials $f$ and $g$ their resultant $R(f,g)$ is a function of their coefficients. Zeros of resultant $R(f,g)$ correspond to the families of coefficients of $f$ and $g$ such that $f$ and $g$ have a common root. Herewith the calculation of this common root is a separate problem.
  The principal results on calculation of a unique common root of two polynomials and also about calculating a unique root of multiplicity 2 of a polynomial in terms of the first order partial derivatives of resultants and discriminants are given in the monograph by I.M. Gelfand, M.M. Kapranov, A.V. Zelevinsky [1, Ch. 3, Ch. 12]. A significant development of the ideas of this book in the direction of searching for formulas for multiple roots of polynomials is presented in the paper by I.A. Antipova, E.N. Mikhalkin, A.K. Tsikh [2]. The key result of this article is [2, Theorem 1] where the expression for a unique root of multiplicity $s \geq 3$ in terms of the first order partial derivatives of resultant of the polynomial and it's derivative of order $s-1$.
  In the present article the explicit formulas for higher derivatives of resultants of pairs of polynomials possessing common roots are obtained. On this basis a series of results that differ in ideas from [2, Theorem 1] linking higher derivatives of resultants and common multiple roots are proven. In addition the results obtained are applied for a new transparent proof of a refinement of [2, Theorem 1].</description>

      <title>Construction of the log-convex minorant of a sequence $\{M_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^d}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple construction of the log-convex minorant of a sequence $\{M_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^d}$ and consequently extend to the $d$-dimensional case the well-known formula that relates a log-convex sequence $\{M_p\}_{p\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ to its associated function $\omega_M$, that is $M_p=\sup_{t&gt;0}t^p\exp(-\omega_M(t))$. We show that in the more dimensional anisotropic case the classical log-convex condition $M_\alpha^2\leq M_{\alpha-e_j}M_{\alpha+e_j}$ is not sufficient: convexity as a function of more variables is needed (not only coordinate-wise). We finally obtain some applications to the inclusion of spaces of rapidly decreasing ultradifferentiable functions in the matrix weighted setting.</description>

Abstract: The main objective of this work is to introduce the generalized convolution with trigonometric weighted $\gamma=\sin y$ involving the Fourier cosine-sine and Kontorovich-Lebedev transforms, and to study its fundamental results. We establish boundedness properties in a two-parametric family of Lebesgue spaces for this convolution operator. Norm estimation in the weighted $ L_p$ space is obtained and applications of the corresponding class of convolution integro-differential equations are discussed. The conditions for the solvability of these equations in $L_1$ space are also founded.</description>

      <title>A Bakry-\'Emery approach to Lipschitz transportation on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On weighted Riemannian manifolds we prove the existence of globally Lipschitz transport maps between the weight (probability) measure and log-Lipschitz perturbations of it, via Kim and Milman's diffusion transport map, assuming that the curvature-dimension condition $\mathrm{CD}(\rho_{1}, \infty)$ holds, as well as a second order version of it, namely $\Gamma_{3} \geq \rho_{2} \Gamma_{2}$. We get new results as corollaries to this result, as the preservation of Poincar\'e's inequality for the exponential measure on $(0,+\infty)$ when perturbed by a log-Lipschitz potential and a new growth estimate for the Monge map pushing forward the gamma distribution on $(0,+\infty)$ (then getting as a particular case the exponential one), via Laguerre's generator.</description>
