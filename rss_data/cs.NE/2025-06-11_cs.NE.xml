      <title>A Practical Guide to Tuning Spiking Neuronal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine fundamental elements of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as well as how to tune them. Concretely, we focus on two different foundational neuronal units utilized in SNNs -- the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) and the resonate-and-fire (RAF) neuron. We explore key equations and how hyperparameter values affect behavior. Beyond hyperparameters, we discuss other important design elements of SNNs -- the choice of input encoding and the setup for excitatory-inhibitory populations -- and how these impact LIF and RAF dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fireworks Algorithm Equipped with an Explosion Mechanism based on Student's T-distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world problems can be transformed into optimization problems, which can be classified into convex and non-convex. Although convex problems are almost completely studied in theory, many related algorithms to many non-convex problems do not work well and we need more optimization techniques. As a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, the Fireworks Algorithm(FWA) has been widely studied and applied to many real-world scenarios, even including large language model fine-tuning. But the current fireworks algorithm still has a number of problems. Firstly, as a heuristic algorithm, its performance on convex problems cannot match the SOTA results, and can even be said to be unsatisfactory; secondly, the sampling methods (explosion) of most FWA variants are still uniform sampling, which is actually inefficient in high dimensional cases. This work of ours proposes a new student's t-distribution based FWA(TFWA) with a solid theoretical foundation, which fully utilizes the advantage that student's t-distribution can adjust the parameters (degrees of freedom) and thus adjust the exploitation capability. We have fully experimented on mainstream benchmarks CEC2013 and CEC2017, which proves that TFWA not only becomes the strongest variant of the fireworks algorithm, but also achieves results comparable to SOTA on the test set, and its performance is far superior to that of the SOTA algorithm in some scenarios with a large number of extreme points.</description>

      <title>Superposed Parameterised Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline; on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.</description>

      <title>syren-baryon: Analytic emulators for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys, acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Language Models Learn Remarkably Accurate Representations of Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models' representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered by our probe can mitigate these errors.</description>

      <title>Multi-SpaCE: Multi-Objective Subsequence-based Sparse Counterfactual Explanations for Multivariate Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Learning systems excel in complex tasks but often lack transparency, limiting their use in critical applications. Counterfactual explanations, a core tool within eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), offer insights into model decisions by identifying minimal changes to an input to alter its predicted outcome. However, existing methods for time series data are limited by univariate assumptions, rigid constraints on modifications, or lack of validity guarantees. This paper introduces Multi-SpaCE, a multi-objective counterfactual explanation method for multivariate time series. Using non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-SpaCE balances proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and contiguity. Unlike most methods, it ensures perfect validity, supports multivariate data and provides a Pareto front of solutions, enabling flexibility to different end-user needs. Comprehensive experiments in diverse datasets demonstrate the ability of Multi-SpaCE to consistently achieve perfect validity and deliver superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm: A Dual-Individual Approach for Efficient Training of Multi-Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique, which optimizes neural networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover, represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution, while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence. Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by Pareto dominance and cost post-optimization; and (3) achieved better results compared to gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 99.04% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.06) on a three-layer network with architecture [12288, 17, 4, 1], higher performance a gradient-based approach that achieves 98% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1].</description>

      <title>Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive precision modulation of high-level neural population activity via natural vision perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally approached using invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.</description>
