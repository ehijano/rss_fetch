      <title>W*-superrigidity for cocycle twisted group von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct countable groups $G$ with the following new degree of W*-superrigidity: if $L(G)$ is virtually isomorphic, in the sense of admitting a bifinite bimodule, with any other group von Neumann algebra $L(\Lambda)$, then the groups $G$ and $\Lambda$ must be virtually isomorphic. Moreover, we allow both group von Neumann algebras to be twisted by an arbitrary $2$-cocycle. We also give examples of II$_1$ factors $N$ that are indecomposable in every sense: they are not virtually isomorphic to any cocycle twisted groupoid von Neumann algebra.</description>

      <title>Non-traditional Cartan subalgebras in twisted groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Well-known work of Renault shows that if $\mathcal{E}$ is a twist over a second countable, effective, \'etale groupoid $G$, then there is a naturally associated Cartan subalgebra of the reduced twisted groupoid C*-algebra $C^*_{r}(G; E)$, and that every Cartan subalgebra of a separable C*-algebra arises in this way. However twisted C*-algebras of non-effective groupoids $G$ can also possess Cartan subalgebras: In work by the first author together with Gillaspy, Norton, Reznikoff, and Wright, sufficient conditions on a subgroupoid $S$ of $G$ were found that ensure that $S$ gives rise to a Cartan subalgebra in the cocycle-twisted C*-algebra of $G$. In this paper, we extend these results to general twists $\mathcal{E}$, and we refine the conditions on the subgroupoid for $C^*_{r}(S;\mathcal{E}_S)$ to be a Cartan subalgebra of $C^*_{r}(G;\mathcal{E})$.</description>

      <title>Unique Pseudo-Expectations for Hereditarily Essential $C^*$-Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $C^*$-inclusion $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ is said to be hereditarily essential if for every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ and every non-zero ideal $\{0\} \neq \mathcal{J} \unlhd \mathcal{C}$, we have that $\mathcal{J} \cap \mathcal{A} \neq \{0\}$. That is, $\mathcal{A}$ detects ideals in every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$. By a result of Pitts and Zarikian, a unital $C^*$-inclusion $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ is hereditarily essential if and only if every pseudo-expectation $\theta:\mathcal{B} \to I(\mathcal{A})$ for $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ is faithful. A decade-old open question asks whether hereditarily essential $C^*$-inclusions must have unique pseudo-expectations? In this note, we answer the question affirmatively for some important classes of $C^*$-inclusions, in particular those of the form $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{A} \rtimes_{\alpha,r}^\sigma G$, for a twisted $C^*$-dynamical system $(\mathcal{A},G,\alpha,\sigma)$. On the other hand, we settle the general question negatively by exhibiting $C^*$-irreducible inclusions of the form $C_r^*(G) \subseteq C(X) \rtimes_{\alpha,r} G$ with multiple conditional expectations. Our results leave open the possibility that the question might have a positive answer for regular hereditarily essential $C^*$-inclusions.</description>

      <title>Almost finiteness and groups of dynamical origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06006v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the property of having good subgroups for actions of countable discrete groups on compact metrizable spaces, and show that it implies comparison when the acting group is amenable. As a consequence, free actions on finite-dimensional spaces of many notable amenable groups of dynamical origin are almost finite. For instance, this applies to topological full groups of Cantor minimal systems and the Basilica group. In particular, minimal such actions give rise to classifiable crossed products.</description>

      <title>Homology of Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homological invariants of the Steinberg algebra $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ of an ample groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ over a commutative ring $k$. For $\mathcal{G}$ principal or Hausdorff with ${\mathcal{G}}^{\rm{Iso}}\setminus{\mathcal{G}}^{(0)}$ discrete, we compute Hochschild and cyclic homology of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of groupoid homology. For any ample Hausdorff groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, we find that $H_*(\mathcal{G})$ is a direct summand of $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$; using this and the Dennis trace we obtain a map $\overline{D}_*:K_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))\to H_n(\mathcal{G},k)$. We study this map when $\mathcal{G}$ is the (twisted) Exel-Pardo groupoid associated to a self-similar action of a group $G$ on a graph, and compute $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$ and $H_*(\mathcal{G},k)$ in terms of the homology of $G$, and the $K$-theory of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of that of $k[G]$.</description>

      <title>Free infinite divisibility, fractional convolution powers, and Appell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Initiated by a result of Gorin and Marcus [Int. Math. Res. Not., (3):883--913, 2020] and an observation of Steinerberger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of literature connecting repeated differentiation of polynomials to free additive convolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states that in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many derivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots raised to a free additive convolution power. If the original real roots satisfy some bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is fixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the context of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results have a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated differentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and identify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted Appell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of attraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the roots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely divisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We additionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional convolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is based on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step towards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide a clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible distributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell polynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible distribution.</description>
