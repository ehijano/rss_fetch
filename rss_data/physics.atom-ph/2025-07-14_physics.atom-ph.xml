      <title>Theoretical evaluation of decay mode of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ in solid samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4 \, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states. However, the reported half-lives of $ \gamma $-ray transition are not consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by DFT calculations. Based on these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life for each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $ \mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition, whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ decay via the $ \gamma $-ray transition and has a possibility of decay via internal conversion, and electron bridge.</description>

      <title>Surface scattering of atoms for high-sensitivity spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-sensitivity laser spectroscopy is integral to applications like atomic clocks, quantum computers, and chemical sensing. Lowering atomic temperature decreases spectral Doppler broadening and increases transit time across the excitation laser. We find that a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated surface can cool iron atoms from ~1400 K to room temperature by surface scattering. It is also apparent that a single scattering event is enough for atoms to equilibrate with the PDMS surface temperature. Further, we show the very low adsorption of iron and ytterbium atoms on PDMS, an effect that persists to surface temperatures of 200 K. Through numerical simulation, we demonstrate the potential use of surface scattering in making a room temperature source of collimated atoms with enhanced flux and reduced velocity compared to that without surface scattering.</description>

      <title>What is the diatomic molecule with the largest dipole moment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning model for predicting the electric dipole moment of diatomic molecules using only the atomic properties of the constituent atoms. Our model can screen the entire periodic table and identify the molecules with the largest dipole moment for applications in cold molecular sciences, or find the molecule with the largest dipole moment that contains a given atom. Similarly, our model identifies useful trends that explain the dipole moment of molecules, improving our intuition in chemical physics. Finally, we condense our model into an analytical expression to predict the dipole moment in terms of atomic properties.</description>

      <title>$^{88}$Sr Reference Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strontium-88 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{88}$Sr relevant to these applications. Here we focus on experimental results and supplement these with theoretical values. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{88}$Sr ($^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^1\mathrm{P}_1$, $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}$, and $^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2} \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{S}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving bosonic $^{88}$Sr.</description>

      <title>Suppressing crosstalk for Rydberg quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to suppress crosstalk from implementing controlled-Z gates via local addressing in neutral atom quantum computers. In these systems, a fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates typically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup of two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive a spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the amplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of magnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters. To further reduce the infidelity, we develop a circuit to cancel remaining phase errors. Our results pave the way for using local addressing for high-fidelity quantum gates on Rydberg-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>The SWaP plot: Visualising the performance of portable atomic clocks as a function of their size, weight and power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision timekeeping is fundamental to modern technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), communication networks, financial transactions, and power grid management. Over the past 50 years, microwave atomic clocks have been the standard for timing precision. The new generation of optical atomic clocks have demonstrated orders of magnitude better performance, and are now transitioning from research to practical applications. We provide a web resource that tracks the performance of these optical atomic clocks, measured in terms of their Allan deviation at various integration times, against their SWaP requirements via an interactive plot. The most current data and additional resources are available online, providing a continuously updated reference for those interested in precision timing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in alignment signals in cesium in ultra-weak magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11722v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results of a study of the dynamics of atomic moments alignment in cesium under optical pumping by linearly polarized resonant light in ultra-weak magnetic field are presented. It is shown that there are alignment components whose relaxation does not depend on spin-exchange broadening. The effect of suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in zero magnetic fields is detected, which is similar in its manifestations to the SERF (Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free) effect observed in orientation signals. This observation is interesting from the standpoint of general theory, since the law of conservation of angular momentum responsible for maintaining orientation in the SERF mode should not guarantee the preservation of alignment under the same conditions. A comparison with theoretically calculated parameters of SERF resonances in orientation is given. A qualitative explanation of the observed effect is presented.</description>

      <title>Laser fluence-dependent production of molecular thorium ions in different charge states for trapped-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thorium ions and molecules, recognized for their distinctive nuclear and atomic attributes, are central to numerous trapped-ion experiments globally. Our study introduces an effective, compact source of thorium ions produced via laser ablation of microgram-scale, salt-based samples. We thoroughly analyze the variety of ion species and charge states generated at varying laser fluences. Utilizing 10$\mu$g of thorium fluoride crystals and laser fluences between $1.00 - 7.00$ J$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ we produce thorium molecular ions $^{232}$ThF$_x$$^{n+}$ (with $x= 0 - 3$ and charge states up to $n = 3+$), including ThF$^{2+}$ and ThF$^{3+}$. These species are particularly relevant for spectroscopy; ThF$^{3+}$ is valuable for its stable closed-shell configuration, while ThF$^{2+}$, which is isoelectronic to RaF, offers a unique probe for studying nuclear structure and fundamental symmetries due to its simple electronic structure with a single unpaired electron. Density functional theory calculations of the distribution of positive charge in the produced molecular cations and the simplicity of this setup indicate that this method is easily transferable to other actinide systems.</description>

      <title>Counterflow of lattice polarons in harmonically confined optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional harmonically confined optical lattice interacting repulsively with a bosonic bath. The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows an extended combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</description>

      <title>88Sr+ ion trap apparatus for generating 408 nm photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a 88Sr+ ion trap apparatus with the capability to produce high-quality 408 nm photons aimed at distributed quantum computing and networking applications. This instrument confines ion chains using a surface electrode trap with a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap as an atomic source. Several laser systems spanning 400-1100 nm are used to achieve high fidelity state preparation and readout. Photons are produced via the decay of an exited state, which is accessed using a custom 408 nm laser system that produces 150 ps optical pulses using non-linear photonics. We demonstrate single photon production through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurement for one to six ions.</description>
