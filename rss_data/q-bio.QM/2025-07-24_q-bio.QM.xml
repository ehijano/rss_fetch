      <title>A tissue and cell-level annotated H&amp;E and PD-L1 histopathology image dataset in non-small cell lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histopathology contains morphological and molecular characteristics predictive of immunotherapy response. Computational quantification of TIME characteristics, such as cell detection and tissue segmentation, can support biomarker development. However, currently available digital pathology datasets of NSCLC for the development of cell detection or tissue segmentation algorithms are limited in scope, lack annotations of clinically prevalent metastatic sites, and forgo molecular information such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i) multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&amp;E-stained slides, with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection, and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public NSCLC dataset with manual annotations of H&amp;E in metastatic sites and PD-L1 IHC.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based multimodal prognostic models integrating pathology images and high-throughput omic data for overall survival prediction in cancer: a systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal machine learning integrating histopathology and molecular data shows promise for cancer prognostication. We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745).
  Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas. Approaches included regularised Cox regression (n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). Reported c-indices ranged 0.550-0.857; multimodal models typically outperformed unimodal ones. However, all studies showed unclear/high bias, limited external validation, and little focus on clinical utility.
  Multimodal WSI-omics survival prediction is a fast-growing field with promising results but needs improved methodological rigor, broader datasets, and clinical evaluation.

      <title>Modelling longitudinal polytomous animal data using Bayesian hierarchical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of longitudinal categorical data can be complex and unfeasible due to the number of parameters involved, characterised by overparameterisation leading to model non-convergence, in addition to problems related to sample size and the presence or absence of overdispersion. In this context, we introduce Bayesian hierarchical models as an alternative methodology to classical statistical techniques for analysing nominal polytomous data in longitudinal studies. The theoretical foundation is based on the use of non-informative priors and advanced computational techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which enable a robust and flexible data analysis framework. As a motivating example, the procedure is illustrated through an applied study in agrarian science, focusing on animal welfare, which assessed seven types of behaviours exhibited by pigs over twelve weeks. The results demonstrated the efficacy of Bayesian hierarchical models for the analysis of longitudinal nominal polytomous data. Since the computational procedures were implemented in the R software and the codes are available, this work will serve as support for those who need such analyses, especially in agricultural designs, where longitudinal categorical data are frequently encountered.</description>

      <title>Multi-Label Classification with Generative AI Models in Healthcare: A Case Study of Suicidality and Risk Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs), including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors. This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods, including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets, indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine.</description>

      <title>Frequentist Asymptotics of Variational Laplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational inference is a general framework to obtain approximations to the posterior distribution in a Bayesian context. In essence, variational inference entails an optimization over a given family of probability distributions to choose the member of this family best approximating the posterior. Variational Laplace, an iterative update scheme motivated by this objective, is widely used in different contexts in the cognitive neuroscience community. However, until now, the theoretical properties of this scheme have not been systematically investigated. Here, we study variational Laplace in the light of frequentist asymptotic statistics. Asymptotical frequentist theory enables one to judge the quality of point estimates by their limit behaviour. We apply this framework to find that point estimates generated by variational Laplace enjoy the desirable properties of asymptotic consistency and efficiency in two toy examples. Furthermore, we derive conditions that are sufficient to establish these properties in a general setting. Besides of point estimates, we also study the frequentist convergence of distributions in the sense of total variation distance, which may be useful to relate variational Laplace both to recent findings regarding variational inference as well as to classical frequentist considerations on the Bayesian posterior. Finally, to illustrate the validity of our theoretical considerations, we conduct simulation experiments in our study examples.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of computational approaches for predicting Transthyretin (TTR) transcription activators and human dopamine D1 receptor antagonists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study expands the application of scikit-learn-based machine learning (ML) to the prediction of small biomolecule functionalities based on Carbon 13 isotope (13C) NMR spectroscopy data derived from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notations. The methodology previously demonstrated by predicting dopamine D1 receptor antagonists was upgraded with the addition of new molecular features derived from the PubChem database. The enhanced ML model obtained 75.8% Accuracy, 84.2% Precision, 63.6% Recall, 72.5% F1-score and 75.8 % ROC, when is trained on 25,532 samples and tested on 5,466 samples. To evaluate the applicability of the methodology for a variety of case studies, a comparison was conducted between the prediction capabilities of the ML models based on the human dopamine D1 receptor antagonists and on the neuronal Transthyretin (TTR) transcription activators. Since the TTR bioassay did not contain the required number of samples for comparison, the results were obtained hypothetically. Gradient Boosting classifier was the optimal model for TTR transcription activators, achieving hypothetical 67.4% Accuracy, 74.0% Precision, 53.5% Recall, 62.1% F1-score, 67.4 % ROC, if it could be trained with 25,532 samples and tested with 5,466 samples. In addition to the main study, to the attention of those interested in neuronal TTR, the CID_SID ML model has been developed to predict whether a compound, initially designed for another purpose, possesses TTR transcription activation capabilities. This ML model was based solely on its PubChem CID and SID and achieved 81.5% Accuracy, 94.6% Precision, 66.8% Recall, 78.3% F1-score, 81.5 % ROC.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Seasickness through Brain-Computer Interface-based Attention Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seasickness poses a widespread problem that adversely impacts both passenger comfort and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. Although attention shift has been proposed as a potential method to alleviate symptoms of motion sickness, its efficacy remains to be rigorously validated, especially in maritime environments. In this study, we develop an AI-driven brain-computer interface (BCI) to realize sustained and practical attention shift by incorporating tasks such as breath counting. Forty-three participants completed a real-world nautical experiment consisting of a real-feedback session, a resting session, and a pseudo-feedback session. Notably, 81.39\% of the participants reported that the BCI intervention was effective. EEG analysis revealed that the proposed system can effectively regulate motion sickness EEG signatures, such as an decrease in total band power, along with an increase in theta relative power and a decrease in beta relative power. Furthermore, an indicator of attentional focus, the theta/beta ratio, exhibited a significant reduction during the real-feedback session, providing further evidence to support the effectiveness of the BCI in shifting attention. Collectively, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, which has the potential to open up a brand-new application domain for BCIs.</description>
