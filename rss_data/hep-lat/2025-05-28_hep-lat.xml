      <title>Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with Improved Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with improved chiral properties, starting from a construction of Creutz-Horvath-Neuberger that provides a doubler-free Hamiltonian lattice regularization for Dirac fermions in even spacetime dimensions. We use a higher-order generalization of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation due to Fujikawa, which yields an order-$k$ Hamiltonian overlap operator for each integer $k \geq 0$, with an exactly conserved but nonquantized chiral charge that becomes quantized as $k \to \infty$. Our construction provides physical insight into how Fujikawa's higher-order Ginsparg-Wilson relation improves chiral symmetry while reproducing the anomaly, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in any Hamiltonian lattice realization of an anomalous chiral symmetry. This class of Hamiltonian lattice regularizations, with their tunable chiral symmetry properties, offers potential advantages for quantum and tensor-network simulations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Adjoint chromoelectric correlators for heavy quarkonium diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here measure, for the first time, adjoint chromoelectric correlators at finite temperatures that encode the diffusion of quarkonium in the medium. Understanding the dynamics of quarkonium in the QGP plays an essential role in understanding quarkonium suppression and the QGP in general. We perform SU(3) gauge theory calculations and use gradient flow to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and chromoelectric field discretizations. The continuum limit and the zero-flow-time extrapolation are performed, and the final result is compared with perturbative results. We observe that the correlators at a high temperature are well described by the perturbative form; furthermore, we observe multiplicative scaling of the adjoint correlators with respect to the fundamental correlator describing heavy quark diffusion.</description>

      <title>The mass of the lightest gluelump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the most up-to-date determinations of the normalization of the leading renormalons of the pole mass, the singlet static potential, the octet static potential, and the gluelump energy. They read $Z^{\rm MS}_m=-Z^{\rm MS}_{V_s}/2=\{0.604(17),0.551(20)\}$, $Z^{\rm MS}_{V_o}=\{0.136(8),0.121(13)\}$, and $Z^{\rm MS}_A=\{-1.343(36),-1.224(43)\}$, for $n_f=0$ and $n_f=3$ respectively. We obtain two independent renormalization group invariant and renormalization scale independent determinations of the energy of the ground state gluelump in the principal value summation scheme: $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.47(9)r_0^{-1}$ and $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.38(11)r_0^{-1}$. They combine in $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.44(7)r_0^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Observation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in critical $\mathrm{O}(N)$ models from non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mathrm{O}(N)$ vector models in three dimensions, when defined in a geometry with a compact direction and tuned to criticality, exhibit long-range fluctuations which induce a Casimir effect. The strength of the resulting interaction is encoded in the excess free-energy density, which depends on a universal coefficient: the Casimir amplitude. We present a high-precision numerical calculation of the latter, by means of a novel non-equilibrium Monte Carlo algorithm, and compare our findings with results obtained from large-$N$ expansions and from the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a digital quantum computation of two-hadron scattering in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions. We prepare well-separated single-particle wave packets with desired momentum-space wavefunctions, and simulate their collision through digitized time evolution. Multiple hadronic wave packets can be produced using the efficient, systematically improvable algorithm of this work, achieving high fidelity with the target initial state. Specifically, employing a trapped-ion quantum computer (IonQ Forte), we prepare up to three meson wave packets using 11 and 27 system qubits, and simulate collision dynamics of two meson wave packets for the smaller system. Results for local observables are consistent with numerical simulations at early times, but decoherence effects limit evolution into long times. We demonstrate the critical role of high-fidelity initial states for precision measurements of state-sensitive observables, such as $S$-matrix elements. Our work establishes the potential of quantum computers in simulating hadron-scattering processes in strongly interacting gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Portraits of Charmoniumlike States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The charm quark density-density correlation is calculated for $1S$ and $1P$ conventional charmonia and $J^{PC}=1^{-+},0^{+-}$ charmoniumlike states from lattice QCD and are interpreted as spatial wave functions of these states with some approximations. The angular distributions of $c\bar{c}$ in conventional charmonia are found to be in accordance with the expectation of two-body systems, while that of the $1^{-+}$ state exhibits an $S$-wave feature. However, the $c\bar{c}$ radial distributions turn out to be strikingly different from the non-relativistic quark model and can be understood by the Dirac theory of two-body bound states. These results provide the first gauge invariant and model-independent three-dimensional portraits of charmonium(like) states.</description>

      <title>The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the Standard Model: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the current Standard Model (SM) prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\mu$, updating the first White Paper (WP20) [1]. The pure QED and electroweak contributions have been further consolidated, while hadronic contributions continue to be responsible for the bulk of the uncertainty of the SM prediction. Significant progress has been achieved in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution using both the data-driven dispersive approach as well as lattice-QCD calculations, leading to a reduction of the uncertainty by almost a factor of two. The most important development since WP20 is the change in the estimate of the leading-order hadronic-vacuum-polarization (LO HVP) contribution. A new measurement of the $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ cross section by CMD-3 has increased the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution to a level that makes it impossible to combine the results in a meaningful way. At the same time, the attainable precision of lattice-QCD calculations has increased substantially and allows for a consolidated lattice-QCD average of the LO HVP contribution with a precision of about 0.9\%. Adopting the latter in this update has resulted in a major upward shift of the total SM prediction, which now reads $a_\mu^\text{SM} = 116\,592\,033(62)\times 10^{-11}$ (530 ppb). When compared against the current experimental average based on the E821 experiment and runs 1-3 of E989 at Fermilab, one finds $a_\mu^\text{exp} - a_\mu^\text{SM} =26(66)\times 10^{-11}$, which implies that there is no tension between the SM and experiment at the current level of precision. The final precision of E989 is expected to be around 140 ppb, which is the target of future efforts by the Theory Initiative. The resolution of the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution will be a key element in this endeavor.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the thermal phase structure of the Berenstein--Maldacena--Nastase (BMN) matrix model using non-perturbative lattice Monte Carlo calculations. Our main analyses span three orders of magnitude in the coupling, involving systems with sizes up to $N_{\tau} = 24$ lattice sites and SU($N$) gauge groups with $8 \leq N \leq 16$. In addition, we carry out extended checks of discretization artifacts for $N_{\tau} \leq 128$ and gauge group SU(4). We find results for the deconfinement temperature that interpolate between the perturbative prediction at weak coupling and the large-$N$ dual supergravity calculation at strong coupling. While we confirm that the phase transition is first order for strong coupling, it appears to be continuous for weaker couplings.</description>

      <title>Training neural control variates using correlated configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, additional crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behavior at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality. Effective (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge when gauge modes develop critical correlations. On the other hand, a more standard critical behavior, which admits an effective description in terms of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ theories, occurs when gauge-field modes are short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlation functions from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. We discuss the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of systems with a classical partition function, focusing mainly on three-dimensional systems, and only briefly discussing two-dimensional models. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>
