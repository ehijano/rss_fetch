      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>

      <title>Scalar relics from the hot Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we motivate the fact that couplings between a scalar field and the Standard Model with strengths $10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity yield the total measured cosmological dark matter abundance over a broad mass range of $10^{-12}$ to $10^{14}\ \rm{eV}$. Remarkably, this result holds with minimal sensitivity to whether the scalar couples to electrons, photons, hadrons, or other particles at laboratory energy scales, thereby linking fifth force experiments to the search for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Dark Matter -- Baryon Abundance Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss relaxation solutions to the dark matter - baryon coincidence problem in the context of QCD axion dark matter. In relaxation solutions, a moduli dynamically adjusts the mass of dark matter and baryons until their energy densities are $\mathrm{O}(1)$ the same. Because the QCD axion is heavily connected to QCD, scanning the QCD axion mass inherently also scans the proton mass. In the context of relaxation solutions, this implies that the ratio of dark matter to baryon abundances ($\Omega_{\rm DM}/\Omega_{\rm B}$) is a ratio of beta functions showing that these models can only accommodate discrete values of $\Omega_{\rm DM}/\Omega_{\rm B}$ thereby ``predicting" the ratio of the dark matter to baryon abundances. The original composite axion model has only a single integer degree of freedom $N$, the size of the gauge group, and we show that when $N=8$ the observed value of $\Omega_{\rm DM}/\Omega_{\rm B} = 5.36$ is reproduced to within its percent level error bars. Novel tests of this model include more precise measurements of $\Omega_{\rm DM}/\Omega_{\rm B}$, a better lattice determination of the dependence of the proton mass on the high energy QCD gauge coupling, as well as more traditional tests such as fifth force experiments.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Incoherent Noise: A Coherent Quantum Approach in Multi-Sensor Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel dark matter detection scheme by leveraging quantum coherence across a network of multiple quantum sensors. This method effectively eliminates incoherent background noise, thereby significantly enhancing detection sensitivity. This is achieved by performing a series of basis transformation operations, allowing the coherent signal to be expressed as a combination of sensor population measurements without introducing background noise. We present a comprehensive analytical analysis and complement it with practical numerical simulations. These demonstrations reveal that signal strength is enhanced by the square of the number of sensors, while noise, primarily due to operational infidelity rather than background fluctuations, increases only linearly with the number of sensors. Our approach paves the way for next-generation dark matter searches that optimally utilize an advanced network of sensors and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical approach for combinatorial problems at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum computing has drawn significant interest within the field of high-energy physics. We explore the potential of quantum algorithms to resolve the combinatorial problems in particle physics experiments. As a concrete example, we consider top quark pair production in the fully hadronic channel at the Large Hadron Collider. We investigate the performance of various quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and a feedback-based algorithm (FALQON). We demonstrate that the efficiency for selecting the correct pairing is greatly improved by utilizing quantum algorithms over conventional kinematic methods. Furthermore, we observe that gate-based universal quantum algorithms perform on par with machine learning techniques and either surpass or match the effectiveness of quantum annealers. Our findings reveal that quantum algorithms not only provide a substantial increase in matching efficiency but also exhibit scalability and adaptability, making them suitable for a variety of high-energy physics applications. Moreover, quantum algorithms eliminate the extensive training processes needed by classical machine learning methods, enabling real-time adjustments based on individual event data.</description>

      <title>Dilepton production from moaton quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram of QCD may contain a moat regime in a large region of temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu\neq0$. A moat regime is characterized by quasiparticle moatons (pions) whose energy is minimal at nonzero spatial momentum. At $\mu\neq 0$, higher mass dimension operators play a critical role in a moat regime. At dimension six, there are nine possible gauge invariant couplings between scalars and photons. For back-to-back dilepton production, only one operator contributes, which significantly enhances production near a moat threshold. This enhancement is an experimental signature of moatons.</description>

      <title>Point cloud-based diffusion models for the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high-energy collider experiments, generative models can be used for a wide range of tasks, including fast detector simulations, unfolding, searches of physics beyond the Standard Model, and inference tasks. In particular, it has been demonstrated that score-based diffusion models can generate high-fidelity and accurate samples of jets or collider events. This work expands on previous generative models in three distinct ways. First, our model is trained to generate entire collider events, including all particle species with complete kinematic information. We quantify how well the model learns event-wide constraints such as the conservation of momentum and discrete quantum numbers. We focus on the events at the future Electron-Ion Collider, but we expect that our results can be extended to proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. Second, previous generative models often relied on image-based techniques. The sparsity of the data can negatively affect the fidelity and sampling time of the model. We address these issues using point clouds and a novel architecture combining edge creation with transformer modules called Point Edge Transformers. Third, we adapt the foundation model OmniLearn, to generate full collider events. This approach may indicate a transition toward adapting and fine-tuning foundation models for downstream tasks instead of training new models from scratch.</description>

      <title>Properties of the tensor state $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and decays of the exotic tensor meson $T$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are explored in the context of the diquark-antidiquark model. We treat it as a state built of axial-vector diquark $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }c$ and antidiquark $\overline{b}\gamma _{\nu }C \overline{c}^{T}$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this tetraquark are extracted from two-point sum rules. Our result for $m=(12.70 \pm 0.09)~\mathrm{GeV}$ proves that $T$ is unstable against strong dissociations to two-meson final states. Its dominant decay channels are processes $T \to J/\psi \Upsilon $, $ \eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, and $B_{c}^{(\ast) +}B_{c}^{(\ast) -}$. Kinematically allowed transformations of $T$ include also decays $T\rightarrow D^{(\ast )+}D^{(\ast )-}$ and $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, which are generated by $b\overline{b}$ annihilation inside of $T$ and creation later pairs of $DD$ mesons. The full width of $T$ is estimated by considering all of these channels. Their partial widths are calculated by invoking methods of three-point sum rule approach which are required to evaluate strong couplings at corresponding tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions for the mass and width $\Gamma_{T}=(108.4 \pm 15.4)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor state $T$ provide useful information for experimental studies of fully heavy four-quark exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on warm chromoinflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a model of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton field coupled to a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field. This model naturally leads to a warm inflation scenario, where the inflationary dynamics is dominated by thermal dissipation. In this work, we consider a scenario where the inflaton, an axion-like field, is coupled to the $SU(2)$ gauge field, similar to chromoinflation models. Both the inflaton and the gauge field with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value are coupled to a thermal radiation bath. We demonstrate that the presence of the thermal bath during warm chromoinflation induces a thermal plasma mass for the background gauge field. This thermal mass can significantly disrupt the dynamics of the background gauge field, thereby driving it to its trivial null solution.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Electroweak Phase Transition with a Real Scalar Singlet at a Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) is essential for explaining baryogenesis and for potentially generating observable gravitational waves. This study investigates the potential of a high-energy muon collider to examine the occurrence of SFOEWPT within the context of a Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet (xSM). We analyzed all possible decay modes of the singlet to constrain the valid parameter space of SFOEWPT, which was extracted numerically at different renormalization scales to account for theoretical uncertainties, thereby determining the sensitivity of a muon collider to the production and decay channels of novel heavy scalar particles that emerge in the xSM. The findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV muon collider can directly examine the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking by efficiently detecting novel scalar particles associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition through jet-rich final states, thus complementing the indirect constraints from gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hawking evaporation of black holes formed by dark matter in compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memory burden effect is an explicit resolution to the information paradox by which an evaporating black hole acquires quantum hair, which then suppresses its rate of mass loss with respect to the semi-classical Hawking rate. We show that this has significant implications for particle dark matter that captures in neutron stars and forms black holes that go on to consume the host star. In particular, we show that constraints on the nucleon scattering cross section and mass of spin-0 and spin-1/2 dark matter would be extended by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the model for radiative neutrino masses with dark matter in the $\mathrm{U(1)}_{B-L}$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative seesaw model with gauged $\mathrm{U(1)}_{B-L}\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension is a well-motivated scenario which gives consistent predictions of active neutrino masses and the abundance of dark matter. Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos, the lightest of which can be identified as dark matter, are given by the spontaneous breaking of the $\mathrm{U(1)}_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. We revisit this model with the latest constraints from dark matter searches, neutrino oscillations, flavor experiments and collider experiments. We explore the feasible parameter space of this model, and find that there are still allowed regions under the latest experimental constraints. We present new viable benchmark scenarios for this model, i.e., the right-handed neutrino dark matter scenario and the scalar dark matter scenario. We also mention the testability of these benchmark scenarios at future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of Phase I of an ongoing review of Monte Carlo tools relevant for low-energy hadronic cross sections. This includes a detailed comparison of Monte Carlo codes for electron-positron scattering into a muon pair, pion pair, and electron pair, for scan and radiative-return experiments. After discussing the various approaches that are used and effects that are included, we show differential cross sections obtained with AfkQed, BabaYaga@NLO, KKMC, MCGPJ, McMule, Phokhara, and Sherpa, for scenarios that are inspired by experiments providing input for the dispersive evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarisation.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarized Quasi-particle in Off-equilibrium Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is usually believed that physics in off-equilibrium state characterized by hydrodynamic gradient can be equivalently studied using equilibrium state with suitable metric perturbation. We scrutinize this assumption using chiral kinetic theory in curved space, focusing on spin response to hydrodynamic gradient. Two effects of metric perturbation have been identified: one is to change particle motion by scattering it off the metric fields, which does capture spin response to hydrodynamic gradient, but is limited by kinematic condition in the scattering picture. The other is the genuine effect of off-equilibrium state, which is realizable by mapping the equilibrium state in curved space to flat space through a suitable frame choice. It lifts the kinematic condition in the spin response to hydrodynamic gradient. We classify off-equilibrium effect on spin polarization into modifications of (i) spectral function; (ii) distribution function; (iii) KMS relation. While the last two have been studied using chiral kinetic theory, the first one is usually ignored in kinetic description. We perform a detailed analysis on the first one, finding the radiative correction to spectral function leads to a polarized quasi-particle. The degeneracy of spin responses to different hydrodynamic sources at tree-level is also lifted by radiative correction.</description>

      <title>Impact of scalar NSI with off-diagonal parameters at DUNE and P2SO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied the impact of the off-diagonal SNSI parameters in the future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments DUNE and P2SO. In our analysis, we found that the sensitivities of these experiments altered in a very non-trivial way due to the presence of these parameters. Depending on the values of these parameters, they can either completely mimic the standard scenario or can wash out their CP sensitivity. For large values of parameters $\eta_{e\mu}$ and $\eta_{e\tau}$, we obtained larger mass ordering and octant sensitivities as compared to the standard three flavour scenario. For the parameter $\eta_{\mu\tau}$, the mass ordering sensitivity and the precision of $\Delta m^2_{31}$ deteriorated compared to the standard scenario. Our results also showed that the sensitivities significantly influenced by the phases of the off-diagonal parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing optimal measurements of the electromagnetic dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of the electromagnetic dipole moments of charged leptons are powerful probes of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. It is essential to study avenues for optimizing the measurement strategies for the anomalous magnetic dipole moment (AMDM) and the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the $\tau$-lepton which have recently become accessible at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we study the prospects of employing optimal observables for measuring the AMDM of the $\tau$-lepton in PbPb collisions at the LHC. The performance of optimal observables is investigated in a statistical analysis, assuming an integrated luminosity of 2.0 nb$^{-1}$, approximately corresponding to the amount of data collected during PbPb collisions in Run 2 of the LHC. Improvements of sensitivity to the $\tau$ AMDM with optimal observables are obtained only for a larger phase space than studied so far, more integrated luminosity or including the determination of the helicities of the $\tau$-leptons. Both, chances and limitations, of optimal observables for the $\tau$ AMDM determination will be important to consider in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We report on the reactions $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K} \Xi $ and $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K}\Xi^*(1530)~(\Xi^*(1530)\to \pi\Xi $), and calculate the mass distributions $\frac{{\rm d}\Gamma}{{\rm d}M_\text{inv}(\bar{K}\Xi)}$ and $\frac{{\rm d}\Gamma}{{\rm d}M_\text{inv}(\bar{K}\Xi^*)}$, respectively. We obtain clear peaks corresponding to the $\Omega(2012)$. From the decay of $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K}\Xi^*$, we also get a second, broader, peak around $2035\,\rm MeV$, which comes from the $\Omega(2012)$ decay to $\bar{K}\Xi^*$. This second peak is closely tied to the molecular picture of the $\Omega(2012)$ with the $\bar{K}\Xi^*(1530)$ and $\eta\Omega$ components. Its observation would provide a boost to the molecular picture of the $\Omega(2012)$.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use modern dimensionally-reduced effective field theory methods, with careful attention to scale hierarchies, to analyze and catalog the types of first-order electroweak phase transitions that are possible in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Our calculations lay the necessary groundwork to perform gauge invariant, properly resummed perturbative expansions, and therefore address many of the theoretical problems with phase transition calculations. We find three types of configurations of the scalar potential that allow for a first-order phase transition, namely tree-level barriers, radiative barriers, or radiative symmetry breaking through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We also find versions of these with significant supercooling. We perform a global likelihood scan over the Wilson coefficients of SMEFT operators involving only the Higgs field, to identify parameter regions that exhibit these first-order phase transitions and are consistent with experimental and theoretical constraints. We comment on the possibilities for electroweak baryogenesis within the SMEFT, and roughly estimate if the gravitational wave spectra generated by the phase transitions are detectable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain the difference between the measured decay widths of $b \to c \tau \nu$ processes and of $B\to K\nu\bar{\nu}$ and their values predicted in the Standard Model by introducing the right-handed interactions both to quarks and to leptons. At low energy scales, in addition to the Standard Model particles, we assume the presence of an additional neutral lepton (right-handed neutrino). We then show a specific realization of such a scenario in a model with a single scalar leptoquark ($S_1$), and discuss the corresponding phenomenology.</description>

      <title>The Three-Point Form Factor of $\textrm{Tr}\,\phi^3$ to Six Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the three-point form factor of the length-three half-BPS operator ($\textrm{Tr}\,\phi^3$) in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory, using analyticity and integrability methods. We find that the functions describing the form factor in perturbation theory live in the same restrictive space of multiple polylogarithms as the one describing the form factor of the stress-tensor operator ($\textrm{Tr}\,\phi^2$). Furthermore, we find that the leading-order data in the collinear limit provided by the form factor operator product expansion (FFOPE) is enough to fix the form factor uniquely, at least through six loops. We perform various tests of our results using the subleading FFOPE corrections. We also analyze the form factor in the Regge limit where two Mandelstam invariants are large; we obtain a compact representation for the form factor in this limit which is valid to all orders in the coupling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy is Elastic Cross Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present universal relations between entanglement entropy, which quantifies the quantum correlation between subsystems, and the elastic cross section, which is the primary observable for high energy particle scattering, by employing a careful formulation of wave packets for the incoming particles. For 2-to-2 elastic scattering with no initial entanglement and subdividing the system along particle labels, we show that both the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies in the final states are directly proportional to the elastic cross section in unit of the transverse size for the initial wave packets, which is then interpreted as the elastic scattering probability. The relations do not depend on the underlying dynamics of the quantum field theory and are valid to all orders in coupling strengths. Furthermore, computing quantum correlations between momentum and non-kinematic data leads to entanglement entropies expressed as various semi-inclusive elastic cross sections. Our result gives rise to a novel ``area law'' for entanglement entropy in a two-body system.</description>

      <title>Early Dark Energy Effects on the 21cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early dark energy (EDE) is one of the leading models proposed to resolve the perplexing Hubble tension. Despite extensive scrutiny and testing against various observables, conclusive constraints remain elusive as we await new data. In this paper, we study the impact of EDE on the 21cm signal, a powerful probe of cosmic dawn, and the epoch of reionization. First, we examine the signatures of the shift in cosmological parameters and the new EDE parameters on the evolution of the 21cm signal compared to $\Lambda$CDM. We then focus on the implications of these signatures for upcoming radio interferometer telescopes, such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), and their ability to differentiate between EDE and $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we forecast HERA's sensitivity to the fractional energy density of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, assuming a fiducial EDE model. We find significant modifications to the 21cm signal due to the presence of EDE. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that HERA, operating in its designed configuration, is poised to differentiate between the models and be sensitive to $f_{\rm EDE}$ within $2\sigma$ after $\mathcal{O}(100)$ days of observation and $5\sigma$ after 2 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute analytically the three-loop correlation function of the local operator $\text{tr} \, \phi^3$ inserted into three on-shell states, in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The result is expressed in terms of Chen iterated integrals. We also present our result using generalised polylogarithms, and evaluate them numerically, finding agreement with a previous numerical result in the literature. We observe that the result depends on fewer kinematic singularities compared to individual Feynman integrals. Furthermore, upon choosing a suitable definition of the finite part, we find that the latter satisfies powerful symbol adjacency relations similar to those previously observed for the $\text{tr} \, \phi^2$ case.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling Functions for Identified Particle and Anti-Particle Species across Beam Energies: Insights into Baryon Junction Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the beam energy dependence of azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for mesons and baryons in Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions, spanning \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\) from 7.7 GeV to 5.02 TeV. Scaling functions were derived from species-dependent \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) measurements to explore the interplay between radial flow, hadronic re-scattering, and baryon junction effects. The resulting scaling functions unify the anisotropy data across different species, revealing the underlying collective behavior. Results demonstrate that baryon junctions significantly enhance baryon \(v_n\) at low \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\), where the baryon chemical potential (\(\mu_B\)) is large, leading to a substantial baryon--anti-baryon anisotropy difference that diminishes with increasing \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\). The non-monotonic behavior observed in the specific shear viscosity (\(\eta/s\)) and the radial flow parameters for anti-baryons suggests a change in the system's expansion dynamics near \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39\) GeV, potentially influenced by the critical point of the QCD phase diagram, as well as the combined effects of baryon junctions, hadronic re-scattering, and properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). These findings provide new constraints and insights into baryon transport, the influence of baryon junction contributions, and the equation of state (EOS) and transport coefficients for baryon-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-charmonium interactions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a realistic lattice QCD study on low-energy $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions based on (2+1) flavor configurations with nearly physical pion mass $m_\pi=146$ MeV. The interactions, extracted from the spacetime correlations of nucleon and charmonium system by using the HAL QCD method, are found to be attractive in all distances and possess a characteristic long-range tail consistent with the two-pion exchange potential. The resulting $S$-wave scattering lengths are $0.30(2)\left(^{+0}_{-2}\right)$ fm, $0.38(4)\left(^{+0}_{-3}\right)$ fm, and $0.21(2)\left(^{+0}_{-1}\right)$ fm for spin-$3/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, and spin-$1/2$ $N$-$\eta_c$, respectively. Our results are orders of magnitude larger than those from the photoproduction experiments assuming the vector meson dominance. Our findings may provide deeper understanding of the nonperturbative QCD phenomena ranging from the origin of nucleon mass to the in-medium $J/\psi$ mass modification as well as the properties of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Exploring the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ interaction via femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very recently the Wood-Saxon (WS) type interaction in the single-folding potential approach are constructed to simulate the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials. One set of the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials are based on the first principle HAL QCD $\phi{\text -}N $ interactions in $^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel, and in another set, the $\phi$-meson-nucleus potentials were calculated by employing the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. By utilizing these two set of $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials, the two-particle momentum correlation of $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored. The numerical results show that the correlation functions at small source size (high density nuclear medium) depends on the employed potential model. Also, the correlation functions are obtained within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism. For small source size, it is found that, the LL formula returns significantly different values due to the large interaction range of the $\phi{\text -}\alpha $ potential.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic matter pieces together the hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter composed of hyperons has been hypothesized to occur in neutron stars at densities slightly above the nuclear saturation density and in many descriptions gives rise to a significant softening in the equation of state (EoS). This softening would be at odds with the constraints from neutron star observations and ab initio nuclear matter computations at low density. This inconsistency is known as the hyperon puzzle. We show that Quarkyonic Matter models, which take into account the quark substructure of baryons, can mitigate the hyperon puzzle. We demonstrate two important consequences of the quark substructure effects. First, the hyperon threshold is shifted to a higher density as neutrons preoccupy the phase space for down quarks, preventing the emergence of hyperons at low energy. Secondly, the softening in the EoS becomes mild even above the hyperon threshold density because only little phase space is available for low-energy hyperons; increasing hyperon density quickly drives hyperons into the relativistic regime. In this work, we illustrate these two effects for a matter composed of charge-neutral baryons, using the ideal dual Quarkyonic (IdylliQ) model for three flavors. This model incorporates the Quarkyonic duality and allows us to manifestly express the quark Pauli blocking constraints in terms of the baryon occupation probability. The extension to neutron star matter is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Possibility of quantum Hall effect in neutron star environment: A chiral model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high baryon density and strong magnetic fields are expected in peripheral collisions in heavy-ion collision experiments, such as the upcoming CBM experiment at FAIR in Germany and NICA in Russia. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. We employed the chiral effective model to obtain the constituent quark mass in this non-perturbative QCD regime. A quantized version of conductivity and resistivity is found reliable in the quantum domain of low density and high magnetic fields. Landau quantization gives rise to phenomena similar to SdH oscillations and quantum Hall effect in this regime. We have used a density-dependent magnetic field to observe SdH-type oscillations and the possibility of the quantum Hall effect in the interior of neutron stars where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density. Our results indicate the possibility of observing the quantum Hall effect in a neutron star environment as well as in heavy-ion collision of CBM and NICA experiments.</description>

      <title>The Excess of JWST Bright Galaxies: a Possible Origin in the Ground State of Dynamical Dark Energy in the light of DESI 2024 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ compared to that expected in the CDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed Dark Energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance ${\Lambda}$ CDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative {\Lambda} as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range $10 \lesssim z\lesssim 15$ needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of ${\Omega}_{\Lambda}$=[-0.6,-0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range $15 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present the results of calculation of the electric field distribution in the inhomogeneous accelerating section on the base of generalized coupled modes theory. It was shown that the proposed coupled differential equations correctly describe electromagnetic field distribution in the regular part of the section under consideration, which is an analogue of the one being developed at CERN.</description>

      <title>Further support for $S_8$ increasing with effective redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Adil et al. 2023, we reported an increasing trend in $S_8$ with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ based on $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints over the redshift range $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 2$, and predicted that this trend would be observable in independent datasets. Recently, the studies by Artis et al. and the ACT+DESI collaboration appeared, presenting data that aligns with the expected trends. In this letter, we quantify the statistical significance of the increasing $S_8$ trends in recent studies by fitting a linear model to estimate the slope $\Delta\,S_8/\Delta\, z_{\textrm{eff}}$, and comparing the results to mock simulations. We find probabilities of $p = 0.0163$ and $p = 0.01893$, corresponding to approximately $2.1\sigma$ for each dataset. Using Fisher's method to combine the independent probabilities, we obtained $p=0.0027$ ($2.8 \sigma$). When we incorporate our earlier findings, the combined statistical significance reaches between $3\sigma$ and $3.7\sigma$. This letter continues a series of studies initiated in 2020 that explore redshift-dependent $\Lambda$CDM parameters as an indication of a breakdown in the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Differential High-Frequency Lock-In Probe for Laser-Induced Vacuum Birefringence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of laser-induced vacuum birefringence through the use of pulsed lasers coupled to femtosecond optical enhancement cavities. This measurement technique features cavity-enhanced pump and probe pulses, as well as an independent control pulse. The control pulse allows for a differential measurement where the final signal is obtained using high-frequency lock-in detection, greatly mitigating time-dependent cavity birefringence as an important and possibly prohibitive systematic effect. In addition, the method features the economical use of laser power, and results in a relatively simple experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of (multi)strange hadron $\bf p_t$ spectra from small collision systems at the large hadron collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small collision systems, e.g. $p$-$p$ and $p$-Pb collisions, comprise a potential reference for more-central A-A collisions with regard to production (or not) of a thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Small systems with low particle densities should evolve according to simple QCD mechanisms including projectile-nucleon dissociation and dijet production. But it is now claimed that QGP may appear even in $p$-$p$ collisions based on apparent evidence for radial flow from shape evolution of $p_t$ spectra and from variation of total yields for strange and multistrange hadrons relative to statistical models. The present study confronts such arguments with a detailed analysis of $p_t$ spectra for strange and multistrange hadrons from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions and 13 TeV $p$-$p$ collisions via a two-component model (TCM) of hadron production. Based on previous analysis of lighter hadrons the TCM accurately predicts spectra for Cascade and Omega hadrons. Significant results include multistrange hadron spectra dominated by jet fragments, variation of strange-hadron abundances exaggerated by certain plot formats and spectrum extrapolations, and detailed relations between ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ variation with event charge density and small shifts of jet fragment distributions on $p_t$. Within a TCM context $p$-$p$ and $p$-Pb collision systems with comparable jet contributions are found to be equivalent within data uncertainties. Attribution of certain data features to radial flow is doubtful.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Particle Production from Bubble Dynamics at a First Order Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First order phase transitions (FOPTs) constitute an active area of contemporary research as a promising cosmological source of observable gravitational waves. The spacetime dynamics of the background scalar field undergoing the phase transition can also directly produce quanta of particles that couple to the scalar, which has not been studied as extensively in the literature. This paper provides the first careful examination of various aspects of this phenomenon, which is important for understanding the dynamics of the phase transition, the generation of gravitational waves, and various high energy and beyond the Standard Model phenomena. In particular, the contributions from various stages of FOPTs (bubble nucleation, expansion, collision, post-collision) are disentangled, and conceptual aspects of the associated underlying physics relevant for particle production are clarified. Subtleties related to non-universality of particle interactions and masses in different vacua are discussed, and the suppression of nonperturbative effects such as tachyonic instability and parametric resonance due to the inhomogeneous nature of the process is examined.</description>

      <title>$N_{\rm eff}$ as a new physics probe in the precision era of cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global fit to the electroweak vertices and 4-fermion operators of the standard model effective field theory in this work using $N_{\rm eff}$ from cosmological probes, as well as data sets from colliders and low-energy experiments. We find $N_{\rm eff}$, both its current measurement and future projections, can only marginally improve the fit in both the flavor universal and the most general flavor scenarios. The resulting $1\sigma$ bound on $N_{\rm eff}$ is significantly improved from the global fit and becomes comparable to its current theoretical uncertainty, such that the latter will become important for this study at next generation experiments like future lepton colliders. $N_{\rm eff}$ from the global fit is also adopted to predict the primordial helium abundance $Y_P$, which significantly reduces the parameter space on the $Y_P$-$N_{\rm eff}$ plane. Through error propagation, we also conclude that reducing the experimental uncertainty of $Y_P$ from metal-poor galaxies down below 0.2% could play an important role in deepening our understanding on the free neutron lifetime anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a nonrelativistic potential quark model framework, we carry out a calculation of the mass spectrum for the low-lying $1S$ all-heavy pentaquark state by adopting the explicitly correlated Gaussian method. The obtained states are compact and lie far above the lowest dissociation baryon-meson threshold. Moreover, using the obtained masses and wave functions we evaluate the fall-apart decay properties within a quark-exchange model. The results show that the $1S$ all-heavy pentaquark states have a fairly narrow fall-apart width, which scatters in the range of $\sim0.1-4.0$ MeV. Their dominant fall-apart decay channels may be ideal for searching for their signals in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Tests of P and CP Symmetries Using Octet Baryons at the $J/\psi$ Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate tests of the parity P and the combined parity and charge-conjugate CP symmetries from differential angular distributions of $J/\psi$ decaying into the lowest-lying baryon pairs at BESIII and the next-generation super tau-charm facilities (STCFs). Large corrections from $Z$ and $W$ exchange induced parity violating effects are found for $J/\psi$ decays with large logarithms resummed up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$. The parity-violating asymmetries on the production and the decay sides of $J/\psi$ are both estimated to be of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, thus barely observable with the 10 billion $J/\psi$ events currently collected at BESIII. Nevertheless, these asymmetries utilizing the current BESIII data already permit a measurement of the weak mixing angle with an absolute uncertainty $\delta s_w^2\approx{0.09}$, corresponding to the first determination of $s_w^2$ at the $J/\psi$ threshold. In the future, STCFs are estimated to improve this bound by a factor of $\sim\,20$ to $\delta s_w^2\approx{0.005}$ within one year based on luminosity rescaling. We also obtain the 95% confidence level upper bounds on the electric dipole moments of the octet baryons, which are of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-18})\,e{\rm\,cm}$ for BESIII and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-19})\,e{\rm\,cm}$ for STCFs. These bounds are improved by two to three orders of magnitude in comparison with the only existing one on $\Lambda$ from Fermilab. The method discussed in this work also paves a way for a first and direct measurement of the $\Xi$ and $\Sigma$ electric dipole moments.</description>

Abstract: Different ways exist to obtain the elements of the $\{\beta \}$-expansion for renormgroup invariant quantities. Here we consider independent confirmation within the standard QCD of a number of our results [1] for the values of elements of this expansion for the nonsinglet Adler $D_A$-function, Bjorken polarized sum rules $S^{Bjp}$ up to the order N$^4$LO. We suggest an approach to estimate the results of high order QCD calculations using a smaller number of diagrams of the specific type. This type is based on a proposed generalization of Naive NonAbelianization.</description>

Abstract: We examine the effect of finite top- and bottom-quark masses on the Higgs production cross section in the gluon-gluon fusion channel. We employ both $\overline{\text{MS}}$ and on-shell renormalisation for the quark masses and provide a thorough comparison. Furthermore, we explore alternative treatments of quark masses, in particular in the four-flavour scheme, and investigate their impact on the cross section. Our work also presents novel predictions for differential cross sections in the Higgs rapidity. The results lead to a significant reduction of scale uncertainties, and our analysis enables us to offer well-grounded recommendations for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane for varying pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of a varying pion mass on the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram in the presence of an external magnetic field, aiming to understand it, for the first time, using Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio like effective models. We compare results from both its local and nonlocal versions. In both cases, we find that the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) near the crossover is eliminated with increasing pion mass, while the decreasing trend of crossover temperature with increasing magnetic field persists for pion mass values at least up to $440$ MeV. Thus, the models are capable of capturing qualitatively the results found by lattice QCD (LQCD) for heavy (unphysical) pions. The key feature in the models is the incorporation of the effect of a reduction in the coupling constant with increasing energy. Along with reproducing the IMC effect, it enables models to describe the effects of heavier current quark masses without introducing additional parameters. For the local NJL model, this agreement depends on how the parameters of the model are fit at the physical point. In this respect, the nonlocal version, which, due to its formulation, automatically exhibits the IMC effect around the crossover region, captures the physics more naturally. We further use the nonlocal framework to determine the pion mass beyond which the IMC effect around the transition region does not exist anymore.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ pole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several LQCD simulations have proven that the interaction in the isoscalar channel in $DD^*$ scattering is attractive. This channel is naturally connected to the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ which is observed in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution. However, it remains an open question whether the virtual bound state found in the several LQCD simulations is actually linked to the LHCb experimental observation. In this article we perform an EFT-based analysis of the LQCD data and demostrate that a proper chiral extrapolation leads to a $T_{cc}$ pole compatible with experiment. At the physical pion mass, we find a virtual bound state with a binding energy $\Delta E=-0.06 \left(^{+1.30}_{-2.20}\right) \left(^{+0.50}_{-1.11}\right)$. Moreover, we extract from a global analysis both, the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}$ pole, and study the role of the $\rho$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement (QE), evidenced by Bell inequality (BI) violations, reveals the nonlocality of nature. Fundamental interactions manifest in various forms, each with distinct effects on QE and BI, but have not yet been studied in depth. We investigate in detail the relationship between QE, Bell nonlocality, and parity-violating interactions in spin-1/2 bipartite systems arising from the decays of spin-0 and spin-1 particles within the quantum field theory (QFT). Our findings reveal that parity (P) violation can completely disentangle particle pairs, rendering Bell tests ineffective in distinguishing between classical and quantum theories. In the spin-0 case, complete disentanglement occurs at maximal P violation, which is similarly true for spin-1 decays. Without restrictions from the QFT, the predicted relation between entanglement and the Bell nonlocality may no longer be valid and we propose promising methods for testing it. Additionally, we emphasize the previously overlooked influence of magnetic fields within detectors, which alters predictions for QE and Bell nonlocality. This environmental effect induces spurious P and charge-parity (CP) violations and thus has to be subtracted for genuine P, CP, and Bell tests.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Inelastic Dark Matter Window with Vector Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the robust cosmological and astrophysical evidence confirming the existence of a non-baryonic matter component in the Universe, the underlying nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains a mystery. Among the several possible scenarios, light DM candidates thermally produced in the early Universe are especially interesting, since their abundance could be set via the standard freeze-out mechanism. Additionally, new light states can present a rich phenomenology and are attracting increasing attention due to recent experimental capabilities to probe dark sectors with feeble interactions. In particular, inelastic DM (iDM) candidates are an appealing option, since they can avoid cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation bounds as well as indirect and direct detection searches. Although such models have been intensively studied in the literature, the usual scenario is to consider a secluded dark photon mediator. In this work, we consider the case of iDM with general vector mediators and explore the consequences of such a choice in the relic density computation, as well as for the cosmological and experimental bounds. We examine models with couplings to baryon and lepton number and show new viable parameter regions for inelastic dark matter models. Especially, anomaly-free gauge groups with non-universal couplings to leptons open new windows of the parameter space for thermal dark matter yet unexplored by experiments. We also provide a numerical Python library to compute the relic densities for user-defined gauge charges.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability in the Born approximation. The resultant errors are around $20 \ \%$ for Ar and $60 \ \%$ for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The transition is dominated by the outermost shell electrons. The error for Xe atom will become better for high energy because of the approximation and lack of data.</description>

      <title>Total cross section of the process $e^+ + e^- \to \Sigma^+ + \bar{\Sigma}^-$ including the $D$-meson loop and three-gluon contributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate the production of a baryon pair in $e^+e^-$ annihilation to study the structure of baryons. To study the basic structure of the Standard Model, it is also necessary to consider the baryon-antibaryon pair production at the electron-positron linear collider. The production of a baryon pair in electron-positron annihilation provides a powerful tool at higher center-of-mass energies. In this work, we present phenomenological results for $\Sigma^+ \bar {\Sigma}^-$ production in $e^+e^-$ collision at the BESIII Collider. We investigate a hyperon pair produced in the reaction $e^+e^- \to \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$. Two different contributions are considered: the $D$ meson loop and the three-gluon charmonium annihilation loop. Taking into account the contributions of the $D$-meson loop and three-gluon loops and the interference of all diagrams, we calculate the total cross section of the process $e^+e^- \to \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$. With respect to a purely electromagnetic mechanism, large relative phases are generated for these contributions. We obtain as a byproduct a fit of the electromagnetic form factor of the $\Sigma$ hyperon for a large momentum transferred region. In this process, in addition to $\psi(3770)$ charmonium, we also take into account the contributions of other charmonium (-like) states, $\psi(4040)$, \,\,$\psi(4160)$, \,\,$Y(4230)$,\,\,$Y(4360)$,\,\,$\psi(4415)$, and $Y(4660)$. The obtained results are in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence between mass eigenstates of a neutrino can be destroyed by its mass-momentum entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Invisible Higgs decay from dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Higgs boson decay into dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling. Even though the Higgs-DM coupling is significant, up to order one, DM does not thermalize due to the Boltzmann suppression of its production at low temperatures. We find that this mechanism leads to observable Higgs decay into invisible final states with the branching fraction of 10% and below, while producing the correct DM relic abundance. This applies to the DM masses down to the MeV scale, which requires a careful treatment of the hadronic production modes. For DM masses below the muon threshold, the Boltzmann suppression is not operative and the freeze-in nature of the production mechanism is instead guaranteed by the smallness of the electron Yukawa coupling. As a result, MeV DM with a significant coupling to the Higgs boson remains non-thermal as long as the reheating temperature does not exceed $\mathcal{O}(100)\;$MeV. Our findings indicate that there are good prospects for observing light non-thermal DM via invisible Higgs decay at the LHC and FCC.</description>

      <title>White Paper on Light Sterile Neutrino Searches and Related Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This white paper provides a comprehensive review of our present understanding of experimental neutrino anomalies that remain unresolved, charting the progress achieved over the last decade at the experimental and phenomenological level, and sets the stage for future programmatic prospects in addressing those anomalies. It is purposed to serve as a guiding and motivational "encyclopedic" reference, with emphasis on needs and options for future exploration that may lead to the ultimate resolution of the anomalies. We see the main experimental, analysis, and theory-driven thrusts that will be essential to achieving this goal being: 1) Cover all anomaly sectors -- given the unresolved nature of all four canonical anomalies, it is imperative to support all pillars of a diverse experimental portfolio, source, reactor, decay-at-rest, decay-in-flight, and other methods/sources, to provide complementary probes of and increased precision for new physics explanations; 2) Pursue diverse signatures -- it is imperative that experiments make design and analysis choices that maximize sensitivity to as broad an array of these potential new physics signatures as possible; 3) Deepen theoretical engagement -- priority in the theory community should be placed on development of standard and beyond standard models relevant to all four short-baseline anomalies and the development of tools for efficient tests of these models with existing and future experimental datasets; 4) Openly share data -- Fluid communication between the experimental and theory communities will be required, which implies that both experimental data releases and theoretical calculations should be publicly available; and 5) Apply robust analysis techniques -- Appropriate statistical treatment is crucial to assess the compatibility of data sets within the context of any given model.</description>

      <title>Strongly coupled gauge theories towards physics beyond the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly coupled gauge theories provide an ultra-violet realization of new physics models for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics arising from composite dynamics. Depending on the gauge group and matter content, they are expected to exhibit interesting features and rich phenomenology, similar or dissimilar to QCD, of which model builders and phenomenologists can take advantage. Due to the non-perturbative nature of these theories, first principles lattice calculations are essential to test the validity of composite models and provide theoretical inputs, that are otherwise unattainable, to the experimental searches for new physics. In this contribution, we will review recent efforts in the non-perturbative lattice studies of strongly coupled gauge theories other than QCD in the context of physics beyond the Standard Model by focusing on technical developments and new results.</description>

      <title>QCD Predictions for Meson Electromagnetic Form Factors at High Momenta: Testing Factorization in Exclusive Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first lattice QCD computation of pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors, $F_M(Q^2)$, at large momentum transfer up to 10 and 28 $\mathrm{GeV}^2$, respectively. Utilizing physical masses and two fine lattices, we achieve good agreement with JLab experimental results at $Q^2 \lesssim 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$. For $Q^2 \gtrsim 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, our results provide $\textit{ab-initio}$ QCD benchmarks for the forthcoming experiments at JLab 12 GeV and future electron-ion colliders. We also test the QCD collinear factorization framework utilizing our high-$Q^2$ form factors at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, which relates the form factors to the leading Fock-state meson distribution amplitudes. Comparisons with independent lattice QCD calculations using the same framework demonstrate, within estimated uncertainties, the universality of these nonperturbative quantities.</description>

      <title>Full Event Particle-Level Unfolding with Variable-Length Latent Variational Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurements performed by particle physics experiments must account for the imperfect response of the detectors used to observe the interactions. One approach, unfolding, statistically adjusts the experimental data for detector effects. Recently, generative machine learning models have shown promise for performing unbinned unfolding in a high number of dimensions. However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces. The performance of this method is evaluated in the context of semi-leptonic top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformers for High-Energy Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting scientific understanding from particle-physics experiments requires solving diverse learning problems with high precision and good data efficiency. We propose the Lorentz Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr), a new multi-purpose architecture for high-energy physics. L-GATr represents high-energy data in a geometric algebra over four-dimensional space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations, the symmetry group of relativistic kinematics. At the same time, the architecture is a Transformer, which makes it versatile and scalable to large systems. L-GATr is first demonstrated on regression and classification tasks from particle physics. We then construct the first Lorentz-equivariant generative model: a continuous normalizing flow based on an L-GATr network, trained with Riemannian flow matching. Across our experiments, L-GATr is on par with or outperforms strong domain-specific baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of analytical regularization used in the generalized function (distribution) space to the Tikhonov regularization procedure utilized in the different versions of Moore-Penrose's inversion. By introducing a new analytical term to the Tikhonov regularization of Moore-Penrose's inversion procedure, we derive new optimization conditions that extend the Tikhonov regularization framework and influence the fitting parameter. This enhancement yields a more robust and accurate reconstruction of physical quantities, demonstrating its potential impact on various studies. We illustrate the significance of new term through schematic examples of physical applications, highlighting its relevance to diverse fields. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving inversion methods and their applications in physics and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spin mode by solving the axial kinetic equations under the relaxation time approximation in the presence of dissipative sources. We find transient spin modes in response to electric field with spacetime inhomogeneity, fluid acceleration and shear. To the lowest order in spatial momentum $k$, we find the responses to electric field and acceleration can be interpreted as retarded response to temporal variations of magnetic field and vorticity respectively. The response to shear occurs at $O(k^2)$ and can be reduced to retarded response to spatial variation of vorticity. Beyond lowest order, the responses to all three sources are non-local with branch cut in the dispersions. We argue that the non-locality is a consequence of the quasi-particle picture underlying the kinetic description. We also analyze spin transport equation taking into account spin response to temporal and spatial variations of vorticity. We find the corrections turn the original first order spin transport equation into a third order one (or a second order one in the homogeneous limit). The change in order of transport equation is a consequence of non-local nature of the responses, suggesting possible breakdown of gradient expansion in spin hydrodynamics for microscopic theories with quasi-particles.</description>

Abstract: State-of-the-art simulations of high-energy nuclear collisions rely on hybrid setups, involving in particular a pre-equilibrium stage to let the system evolve from a far-from-equilibrium initial condition towards a near-equilibrated state after which fluid dynamics can be applied meaningfully. A known issue is the mismatch between the equation of state in the fluid-dynamical evolution and the effective one in the previous stage, which leads to discontinuities at the interface between the two models. Here we introduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy, and we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation. We study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the models and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the latter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of matching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the initial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over thermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.</description>

Abstract: It is generally assumed that scalar field dark matter halos would contain solitonic cores -- spherically symmetric ground state configurations -- at their centers. This is especially interesting in the case of ultralight dark matter (ULDM), where the solitons sizes are on the order of galaxies. In this work, we show that the paradigm of a spherically symmetric soliton embedded in the center of each halo is not universally valid in a scenario with multiple interacting scalar fields. In particular, sufficiently strong repulsive interspecies interactions make the fields immiscible. In such models, the ground state configuration can fall into a number of different phases that depend on the fields' relative densities, masses, and interaction strengths. This raises the possibility that the inner regions of ULDM halos are more complex and diverse than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity with purely virtual particles from asymptotically local quantum field theory</title>

Abstract: We investigate the local limits of various classes of unitary, nonlocal quantum field theories. While it is easy to build nonlocal models with well-behaved asymptotics in Euclidean space, the Minkowskian correlation functions typically exhibit singular behaviors. We introduce "asymptotically local" quantum field theory (AL-QFT) as the class that encompasses unitary, nonlocal theories with well-defined local limits in Minkowski spacetime. The target models cannot propagate ghosts, but are allowed to contain purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We build examples of AL-QFTs, including a deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.</description>
