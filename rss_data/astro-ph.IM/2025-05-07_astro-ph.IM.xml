      <title>Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL): Rubin-era photometric redshift stress-testing and at-scale production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtually all extragalactic use cases of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require the use of galaxy redshift information, yet the vast majority of its sample of tens of billions of galaxies will lack high-fidelity spectroscopic measurements thereof, instead relying on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) subject to systematic imprecision and inaccuracy best encapsulated by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs). We present the version 1 release of Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL), an open source Python library for at-scale probabilistic photo-$z$ estimation, initiated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) with contributions from the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. RAIL's three subpackages provide modular tools for end-to-end stress-testing, including a forward modeling suite to generate realistically complex photometry, a unified API for estimating per-galaxy and ensemble redshift PDFs by an extensible set of algorithms, and built-in metrics of both photo-$z$ PDFs and point estimates. RAIL serves as a flexible toolkit enabling the derivation and optimization of photo-$z$ data products at scale for a variety of science goals and is not specific to LSST data. We thus describe to the extragalactic science community, including and beyond Rubin the design and functionality of the RAIL software library so that any researcher may have access to its wide array of photo-$z$ characterization and assessment tools.</description>

      <title>Variational diffusion transformers for conditional sampling of supernovae spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have become the most precise distance indicators in astrophysics due to their incredible observational homogeneity. Increasing discovery rates, however, have revealed multiple sub-populations with spectroscopic properties that are both diverse and difficult to interpret using existing physical models. These peculiar events are hard to identify from sparsely sampled observations and can introduce systematics in cosmological analyses if not flagged early; they are also of broader importance for building a cohesive understanding of thermonuclear explosions. In this work, we introduce DiTSNe-Ia, a variational diffusion-based generative model conditioned on light curve observations and trained to reproduce the observed spectral diversity of SNe Ia. In experiments with realistic light curves and spectra from radiative transfer simulations, DiTSNe-Ia achieves significantly more accurate reconstructions than the widely used SALT3 templates across a broad range of observation phases (from 10 days before peak light to 30 days after it). DiTSNe-Ia yields a mean squared error of 0.108 across all phases-five times lower than SALT3's 0.508-and an after-peak error of just 0.0191, an order of magnitude smaller than SALT3's 0.305. Additionally, our model produces well-calibrated credible intervals with near-nominal coverage, particularly at post-peak phases. DiTSNe-Ia is a powerful tool for rapidly inferring the spectral properties of SNe Ia and other transient astrophysical phenomena for which a physical description does not yet exist.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Framework for Wide-Field Small Aperture Telescope Arrays Used in Sky Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For time-domain astronomy, it is crucial to frequently image celestial objects at specific depths within a predetermined cadence. To fulfill these scientific demands, scientists globally have started or planned the development of non-interferometric telescope arrays in recent years. Due to the numerous parameters involved in configuring these arrays, there is a need for an automated optimization framework that selects parameter sets to satisfy scientific needs while minimizing costs. In this paper, we introduce such a framework, which integrates optical design software, an exposure time calculator, and an optimization algorithm, to balance the observation capabilities and the cost of optical telescope arrays. Neural networks are utilized to speed up results retrieval of the system with different configurations. We use the SiTian project as a case study to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing that this approach can aid scientists in selecting optimal parameter sets. The code for this framework is published in the China Virtual Observatory PaperData Repository, enabling users to optimize parameters for various non-interferometric telescope array projects.</description>

      <title>A chemically etched D-band waveguide orthomode transducer for CMB measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a prototype D-band waveguide orthomode transducer (OMT) fabricated using chemically etched brass platelets. This method offers a fast, cost-effective, and scalable approach for producing waveguide OMTs above 100 GHz, making it well-suited for current and future Cosmic Microwave Background polarization experiments, where large focal planes with thousands of receivers are required to detect the faint primordial \textit{B}-modes. Chemical etching has already demonstrated its effectiveness in manufacturing corrugated feedhorn arrays with state-of-the-art performance up to 150 GHz. Here, we evaluate its applicability to more complex structures, such as OMTs.
  We designed a single OMT prototype operating in the 130-170 GHz range, fabricated by chemically etching 0.15 mm-thick brass plates, which were then stacked, aligned, and mechanically clamped. Simulations based on metrological measurements of the OMT profile predict return losses below $-$10 dB, isolation better than $-$30 dB, and transmission around $-$0.5 dB.
  The measured transmission and isolation, however, is around $-$1.5/$-$2 dB and $&lt;-$20 dB, respectively. Further simulations show that the degradation in the transmission is related to defects and roughness along the etched profile ($\mathrm{RMS}\simeq$3 $\mu$m), which is a typical and unavoidable effect of chemical etching. The discrepancy in isolation, instead, could arise from a slight rotation ($\sim$3$^{\circ}$) of the polarization angle within the measurement chain.
  Our results show that chemical etching is a fast, low-cost, and scalable technique for producing waveguide OMTs with state-of-the-art performance in terms of return loss and isolation. However, at frequencies above 100 GHz the transmission coefficient may degrade due to the mechanical precision limitations of chemical etching.</description>

      <title>Classification of LEO Satellites Using Occultations of Background Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the result of a proof-of-concept simulation designed to classify LEO satellites based on their occultations of background stars. We generate satellite shapes drawn from two broad shape classes, 'boxwing' and 'square'. We then simulate the resulting occultation photometry that would be caused by these satellites orbiting in LEO and intersecting with background stars. The resulting data is then inverted to attempt to recover the input shape and classify the satellite correctly. We find that the technique is theoretically sound, but ambitious with current telescope capabilities. We construct an equation for the required success rate of the method, as a function of exposure time and density of background stars. We find that successful classification requires short exposure times and high background stellar densities. For success rates in excess of 75%, we find a required exposure time of $\sim2.0\times10^{-3}$s, and $\sim500$ stars along the satellites path. Results are presented in terms of these two key parameters, and are discussed in the context of current observational capabilities and alternative satellite characterisation methods.</description>

      <title>A generalised non-linear reconstructor for all Fourier-type wavefront sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art adaptive optics (AO) systems perform non-linear Fourier-type wavefront sensing for real-time corrections of dynamic wavefront aberrations. This general class of sensors uses a filtering mask in the focal plane that converts phase fluctuations of the incoming light into intensity variations in the subsequent pupil plane. Due to their high sensitivity, Fourier-type wavefront sensors (WFSs) are the sensors of choice for many current and upcoming AO systems in ophthalmic imaging, free-space optical communications (FSOC) and astronomical ground-based telescopes such as the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs). Conventionally, linear methods, like a matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM), are used for the inversion of Fourier-type WFSs. However, their non-linear behavior gives rise to severe performance degradations when significant channel perturbations are observed. They are expected to occur during strong atmospheric turbulence conditions, which are commonplace for non-rural sites and daytime observations.
  This study presents a novel type of iterative reconstructor to overcome non-linear wavefront sensing regimes. The underlying method is the non-linear Landweber iteration with Nesterov acceleration, well known in the field of inverse problems. A significant advantage of the new approach is its direct applicability to any Fourier-type WFS. This is implemented by adapting the filtering mask of the specific Fourier-type WFSs in the model-based algorithm.
  Several Fourier-type wavefront sensors are considered for ELT-scale instruments and their performance with the new algorithm is compared. The study goes on to concentrate on the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS), one of the most well-known Fourier-type WFSs. We demonstrate in end-to-end simulations that this novel approach outperforms linear methods in non-linear sensing regimes.</description>

      <title>Identifying Astrophysical Anomalies in 99.6 Million Cutouts from the Hubble Legacy Archive Using AnomalyMatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical archives contain vast quantities of unexplored data that potentially harbour rare and scientifically valuable cosmological phenomena. We have systematically searched approximately 100 million image cutouts from the entire Hubble Legacy Archive using the recently developed AnomalyMatch method, which combines semi-supervised and active learning techniques for the efficient detection of astrophysical anomalies. This comprehensive search rapidly uncovered a multitude of astrophysical anomalies presented here that significantly expand the inventory of known rare objects. Among our discoveries are 138 new candidate gravitational lenses, 18 jellyfish galaxies, and 417 mergers or interacting galaxes. The efficiency and accuracy of our iterative detection strategy allows us to trawl the complete archive within just 2-3 days, highlighting its potential for large-scale astronomical surveys. We present a detailed overview of these newly identified objects, discuss their astrophysical significance, and demonstrate the considerable potential of AnomalyMatch to efficiently explore extensive astronomical datasets, e.g., upcoming Euclid data releases.</description>

      <title>GrAviPaSt's Lens to the Past: Unveiling the Evolution of Filamentary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple and efficient filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.</description>

      <title>A robust neural determination of the source-count distribution of the Fermi-LAT sky at high latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past 16 years, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has significantly advanced our view of the GeV gamma-ray sky, yet several key questions remain - such as the composition of the isotropic gamma-ray background, the origin of the Fermi Bubbles or the potential presence of signatures from exotic physics like dark matter. Addressing these challenges requires sophisticated astrophysical modeling and robust statistical methods capable of handling high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we analyze 14 years of high-latitude ($|b|\geq30^{\circ}$) Fermi-LAT data in the range from 1 to 10 GeV using simulation-based inference (SBI) via neural ratio estimation. This approach allows us to detect individual gamma-ray sources and derive a list of significant gamma-ray emitters containing more than 98\% of all sources listed in the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL) with a flux $S&gt;3\times10^{-10}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (about a factor of three larger than the flux above which 4FGL is nearly complete), without any non-4FGL source detected in that flux range. Additionally, we reconstruct the source-count distribution in both parametric and non-parametric forms, achieving large agreement with previous literature results as well as those sources detected by our SBI pipeline. We also quantitatively validate our gamma-ray emission simulator via an anomaly detection technique, demonstrating that the synthetic data closely reproduces the complexity of the real observations.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGN distributions (SDSS DR16). We find evidence of an excess of low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as low-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results provide the first observational evidence for GW sources coming from either low-luminosity or low-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.</description>

      <title>Interstellar dust as a dynamic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spite of accounting for only a small fraction of the mass of the Interstellar Medium (ISM), dust plays a primary role in many physical and chemical processes in the Universe. It is the main driver of extinction of radiation in the UV/optical wavelength range and a primary source of thermal IR emission. Dust grains contain most of the refractory elements of the ISM and they host chemical processes that involve complex molecular compounds. However, observational evidence suggests that grain structure is highly non-trivial and that dust particles are characterized by granularity, asymmetry and stratification, which significantly affect their interaction with radiation fields. Accurate modeling of such interaction is fundamental to properly explain observational results, but it is a computationally demanding task. Here we present the possibility to investigate the effects of radiation/particle interactions in non-spherically symmetric conditions using a novel implementation of the Transition Matrix formalism, designed to run on scalable parallel hardware facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ASIACO project is an atlas of cometary imaging and spectroscopy obtained from the Asiago Astrophysical Observatory between 2012 and 2024, still ongoing. Up to now, we monitored 41 comets, acquiring broad-band images using the INAF-OAPd 1.82m Copernico and the 0.67/0.92m Schmidt telescopes, as well as low-to-medium resolution spectra with the DFA-UniPd 1.22m Galileo Telescope. Our dataset offers significant scientific potential, enabling studies on the true extent of cometary tails, orientation of nuclei spin axes, retrieval of compositional data, and determination of production rates for key molecular and atomic species. The Atlas will become publicly available for scientific research, and the project remains active, continuously adding monitored comets.</description>

      <title>The Tensor-Core Beamformer: A High-Speed Signal-Processing Library for Multidisciplinary Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming is a well-known technique to combine signals from multiple sensors. It has a wide range of application domains. This paper introduces the Tensor-Core Beamformer: a generic, optimized beamformer library that harnesses the computational power of GPU tensor cores to accelerate beamforming computations. The library hides the complexity of tensor cores from the user, and supports 16-bit and 1-bit precision. An extensive performance evaluation on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs shows that the library outperforms traditional beamforming on regular GPU cores by a wide margin, at much higher energy efficiency. In the 16-bit mode, it achieves over 600 TeraOps/s on an AMD MI300X GPU, while approaching 1 TeraOp/J. In the 1-bit mode, it breaks the 3 PetaOps/s barrier and achieves over 10 TeraOps/J on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The beamforming library can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We demonstrate its use for medical ultrasound and radio-astronomical instruments.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Forecast: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Solar Flare Class Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares are among the most powerful and dynamic events in the solar system, resulting from the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's atmosphere. These energetic bursts of electromagnetic radiation can release up to 10^32 erg of energy, impacting space weather and posing risks to technological infrastructure and therefore require accurate forecasting of solar flare occurrences and intensities. This study evaluates the predictive performance of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classifying solar flares into 4 categories (B, C, M, X). Using the dataset of 13 SHARP parameters, the effectiveness of the models was evaluated in binary and multiclass classification tasks. The analysis utilized 8 principal components (PC), capturing 95% of data variance, and 100 PCs, capturing 97.5% of variance. Our approach uniquely combines binary and multiclass classification with different levels of dimensionality reduction, an innovative methodology not previously explored in the context of solar flare prediction. Employing a 10-fold stratified cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning ensured robust model evaluation. Our findings indicate that Random Forest and XGBoost consistently demonstrate strong performance across all metrics, benefiting significantly from increased dimensionality. The insights of this study enhance future research by optimizing dimensionality reduction techniques and informing model selection for astrophysical tasks. By integrating this newly acquired knowledge into future research, more accurate space weather forecasting systems can be developed, along with a deeper understanding of solar physics.</description>

      <title>Development of a polarimetry method toward in-situ substrate birefringence characterization of ground-based gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is necessary to enrich scientific outcome of gravitational wave astronomy. Birefringence in test mass mirrors of gravitational wave detectors can become an important factor for both current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors to achieve improved performance. In-situ birefringence characterization can become an essential diagnostic tool for detector performance, and needs to be established. We report a possible in-situ birefringence characterization method and its experimental results with a tabletop setup. The scheme proposed and demonstrated in this paper can be used as a diagnostic tool in large-scale gravitational wave detectors. We also discuss possible technological developments toward implementation in future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>AnomalyMatch: Discovering Rare Objects of Interest with Semi-supervised and Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in large datasets is essential in fields such as astronomy and computer vision; however, supervised methods typically require extensive anomaly labelling, which is often impractical. We present AnomalyMatch, an anomaly detection framework combining the semi-supervised FixMatch algorithm using EfficientNet classifiers with active learning. By treating anomaly detection as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, we efficiently utilise limited labelled and abundant unlabelled images. We allow iterative model refinement in a user interface for expert verification of high-confidence anomalies and correction of false positives. Built for astronomical data, AnomalyMatch generalises readily to other domains facing similar data challenges. Evaluations on the GalaxyMNIST astronomical dataset and the miniImageNet natural-image benchmark under severe class imbalance (1% anomalies for miniImageNet) display strong performance: starting from five to ten labelled anomalies and after three active learning cycles, we achieve an average AUROC of 0.95 (miniImageNet) and 0.86 (GalaxyMNIST), with respective AUPRC of 0.77 and 0.71. After active learning cycles, anomalies are ranked with 71% (miniImageNet) to 93% precision in the 1% of the highest-ranked images. AnomalyMatch is tailored for large-scale applications, efficiently processing predictions for 100 million images within three days on a single GPU. Integrated into ESAs Datalabs platform, AnomalyMatch facilitates targeted discovery of scientifically valuable anomalies in vast astronomical datasets. Our results underscore the exceptional utility and scalability of this approach for anomaly discovery, highlighting the value of specialised approaches for domains characterised by severe label scarcity.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a Far-Infrared Kinetic Inductance Detector Prototype for PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is under study as a potential far-IR space mission, featuring actively cooled optics, and both imaging and spectroscopic instrumentation. To fully take advantage of the low background afforded by a cold telescope, spectroscopy with PRIMA requires detectors with a noise equivalent power (NEP) better than $1 \times 10^{-19}$ W Hz$^{-1/2}$. To meet this goal we are developing large format arrays of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) to work across the $25-250$ micron range. Here we present the design and characterization of a single pixel prototype detector optimized for $210$ micron. The KID consists of a lens-coupled aluminum inductor-absorber connected to a niobium interdigitated capacitor to form a 2 GHz resonator. We have fabricated a small array with 28 KIDs, and we measure the performance of one of these detectors with an optical loading in the $0.01 - 300$ aW range. At low loading the detector achieves an NEP of $9\times10^{-20}$ W Hz$^{-1/2}$ at a 10 Hz readout frequency. An extrapolation of these measurements suggests this detector may remain photon noise limited at up to 20 fW of loading, offering a high dynamic range for PRIMA observations of bright astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>Serial MultiView: an efficient approach to mitigating atmospheric spatial-structure errors for VLBI astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric propagation errors are a main constraint on the accuracy of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. For relative astrometry, differential techniques can mitigate these errors, but their effectiveness diminishes with decreasing elevation and increasing angular separations between target and calibrator, among others. The MultiView technique addresses atmospheric spatial-structure errors by observing multiple calibrators around the target and interpolating at the target position, thereby reducing atmospheric errors more effectively than phase-referencing with only one calibrator. The first MultiView realisation at 1.6GHz involved cyclically observing all calibrators and the target, fitting a phase plane from calibrator solutions in each cycle, and is a well-established technique. This implementation reduces on-target time and is constricted by the short atmospheric coherence time at high frequencies. We propose a new realisation, serial MultiView, which rotates the phase plane iteratively based on the time series of calibrator residual phases. This new strategy obviates the necessity of observing all calibrators within each cycle, thereby shortening the observing cycle and offering considerable potential at higher frequencies where the temporal structure is the dominant source of errors. Additionally, by incorporating time-domain information in the iterations, phase ambiguities can be accurately and automatically identified. We verify the astrometric accuracy of serial MultiView at 5GHz by comparing it to conventional MultiView, achieving &lt;10uas error in RA direction, and show the calibration overhead can be reduced in both approaches. This approach enables efficient, high-accuracy differential astrometry and artifact-reduced imaging for astrophysical studies, and we provide a user-friendly tool for it.</description>

      <title>Daily modulations and broadband strategy in axion searches. An application with CAST-CAPP detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been previously advocated that the presence of the daily and annual modulations of the axion flux on the Earth's surface may dramatically change the strategy of the axion searches. The arguments were based on the so-called Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter model which was originally put forward to explain the similarity of the dark and visible cosmological matter densities $\Omega_{\rm dark}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$. In this framework, the population of galactic axions with mass $ 10^{-6} {\rm eV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm eV}$ and velocity $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 10^{-3} c$ will be accompanied by axions with typical velocities $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 0.6 c$ emitted by AQNs. Furthermore, in this framework, it has also been argued that the AQN-induced axion daily modulation (in contrast with the conventional WIMP paradigm) could be as large as $(10-20)\%$, which represents the main motivation for the present investigation. We argue that the daily modulations along with the broadband detection strategy can be very useful tools for the discovery of such relativistic axions. The data from the CAST-CAPP detector have been used following such arguments. Unfortunately, due to the dependence of the amplifier chain on temperature-dependent gain drifts and other factors, we could not conclusively show the presence or absence of a dark sector-originated daily modulation. However, this proof of principle analysis procedure can serve as a reference for future studies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time-Dependent Instrumental Noise for LISA SGWB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variations in the instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) over time are expected as a result of e.g. scheduled satellite operations or unscheduled glitches. We demonstrate that these fluctuations can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires optimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data analysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of mission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for this challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we show by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal information gain can be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>ESPRESSO observations of the debris-accreting white dwarf WD\,0141--675</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: WD\,0141--675 was reported as the first astrometrically detected white dwarf planet host candidate as part of the third data release from \textit{Gaia}, just to be later retracted via a news item on the \textit{Gaia} web site$^1$. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical ESPRESSO spectroscopy of \obj. A radial velocity analysis of the \Ion{Ca}~K absorption line reveals a tentative periodic signal of $15.6\pm0.9$\,d. Phase-folding the ESPRESSO spectroscopy on this signal exhibits weak variability in the morphology of \Ion{Ca}~K close to the core of the line. A violet-to-red ratio analysis of the Ca~K line shows a periodic signal of $16.1\pm0.9$\,d. The periods from both methods agree, within their uncertainties, with half the period of the astrometric planet candidate, however, both measurements are of low statistical significance. Nonetheless, our results imply possible solutions to the mass function within the planetary regime. And when combined with existing infrared photometry, which rules out a brown dwarf companion, yield a lower limit on the orbital inclination of $\sim7^\circ$. Our study demonstrates that ESPRESSO observations are well capable of detecting short-period (days to weeks) giant planets orbiting white dwarfs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled optical cavities, which support normal modes, play a critical role in optical filtering, sensing, slow-light generation, and quantum state manipulation. Recent theoretical work has proposed incorporating nonlinear materials into these systems to enable novel quantum technologies. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of squeezing generated in a quantum-enhanced coupled-cavity system, achieving a quantum noise reduction of 3.3 dB around the normal-mode splitting frequency of 7.47 MHz. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's loss mechanisms and performance limitations, validating theoretical predictions. Our results underscore the promise of coupled-cavity squeezers for advanced quantum applications, including gravitational wave detection and precision sensing.</description>
