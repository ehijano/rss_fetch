      <title>The smashing spectrum of sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arbitrary $\infty$-topos, we classify the smashing localizations in the $\infty$-category of sheaves valued in derived vector spaces: Any of them is the restriction functor to a (unique) closed subtopos. Our proof is based on the existence of a Boolean cover.
  This result in particular gives us the first example of a nonzero presentably symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-category whose smashing spectrum has no points.
  Combining this with the sheaves-spectrum adjunction, we obtain a Tannaka-type categorical reconstruction result for locales.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>

      <title>Adjoint functor theorems for lax-idempotent pseudomonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each pair of lax-idempotent pseudomonads $R$ and $I$, for which $I$ is locally fully faithful and $R$ distributes over $I$, we establish an adjoint functor theorem, relating $R$-cocontinuity to adjointness relative to $I$. This provides a new perspective on the nature of adjoint functor theorems, which may be seen as methods to decompose adjointness into cocontinuity and relative adjointness. As special cases, we recover variants of the adjoint functor theorem of Freyd, the multiadjoint functor theorem of Diers, and the pluriadjoint functor theorem of Solian--Viswanathan, as well as the adjoint functor theorems for locally presentable categories. More generally, we recover enriched $\Phi$-adjoint functor theorems for weakly sound classes of weight $\Phi$.</description>

      <title>A formal category theoretic approach to the homotopy theory of dg categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a bicategory which refines the localization of the category of dg categories with respect to quasi-equivalences and investigate its properties via formal category theory. Concretely, we first introduce the bicategory of dg categories $\mathsf{DBimod}$ whose Hom categories are the derived categories of dg bimodules and then define the desired bicategory as the sub-bicategory $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr}$ consisting only of right quasi-representable dg bimodules. The first half of the paper is devoted to the study of adjunctions and equivalences in these bicategories. We then show that the embedding $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{DBimod}$ is a proarrow equipment in the sense of Richard J. Wood, which is a framework for formal category theory and makes it possible to talk about (weighted) (co)limits in an abstract way. Thus we obtain the notion of homotopical (co)limits in a dg category, including homotopical shifts and cones, by which we obtain a formal characterization of pretriangulated dg categories. As an immediate application we give a conceptual proof of the fact that the pretriangulatedness is preserved under the gluing procedure.</description>

      <title>Position: Categorical Deep Learning is an Algebraic Theory of All Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our position on the elusive quest for a general-purpose framework for specifying and studying deep learning architectures. Our opinion is that the key attempts made so far lack a coherent bridge between specifying constraints which models must satisfy and specifying their implementations. Focusing on building a such a bridge, we propose to apply category theory -- precisely, the universal algebra of monads valued in a 2-category of parametric maps -- as a single theory elegantly subsuming both of these flavours of neural network design. To defend our position, we show how this theory recovers constraints induced by geometric deep learning, as well as implementations of many architectures drawn from the diverse landscape of neural networks, such as RNNs. We also illustrate how the theory naturally encodes many standard constructs in computer science and automata theory.</description>
