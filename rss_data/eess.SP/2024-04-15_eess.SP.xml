      <title>Introducing Graph Learning over Polytopic Uncertain Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This extended abstract introduces a class of graph learning applicable to cases where the underlying graph has polytopic uncertainty, i.e., the graph is not exactly known, but its parameters or properties vary within a known range. By incorporating this assumption that the graph lies in a polytopic set into two established graph learning frameworks, we find that our approach yields better results with less computation.</description>

      <title>Cepstral Analysis Based Artifact Detection, Recognition and Removal for Prefrontal EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes to use cepstrum for artifact detection, recognition and removal in prefrontal EEG. This work focuses on the artifact caused by eye movement. A database containing artifact-free EEG and eye movement contaminated EEG from different subjects is established. A cepstral analysis-based feature extraction with support vector machine (SVM) based classifier is designed to identify the artifacts from the target EEG signals. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 99.62% on the artifact detection task and a 82.79% accuracy on the 6-category eye movement classification task. A statistical value-based artifact removal method is proposed and evaluated on a public EEG database, where an accuracy improvement of 3.46% is obtained on the 3-category emotion classification task. In order to make a confident decision of each 5s EEG segment, the algorithm requires only 0.66M multiplication operations. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in artifact detection and removal, the proposed method features higher detection accuracy and lower computational cost, which makes it a more suitable solution to be integrated into a real-time and artifact robust Brain-Machine Interface (BMI).</description>

      <title>Mental Stress Detection: Development and Evaluation of a Wearable In-Ear Plethysmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental stress is a prevalent condition that can have negative impacts on one's health. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing related illnesses and maintaining overall wellness. This study presents a new method for identifying mental stress using a wearable biosensor worn in the ear. Data was gathered from 14 participants in a controlled environment using stress-inducing tasks such as memory and math tests. The raw photoplethysmography data was then processed by filtering, segmenting, and transforming it into scalograms using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) which are based on two different mother wavelets, namely, a generalized Morse wavelet and the analytic Morlet (Gabor) wavelet. The scalograms were then passed through a convolutional neural network classifier, GoogLeNet, to classify the signals as stressed or non-stressed. The method achieved an outstanding result using the generalized Morse wavelet with an accuracy of 91.02% and an F1-score of 90.95%. This method demonstrates promise as a reliable tool for early detection and treatment of mental stress by providing real-time monitoring and allowing for preventive measures to be taken before it becomes a serious issue.</description>

      <title>SNAKE-fMRI: A modular fMRI data simulator from the space-time domain to k-space and back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new, modular, open-source, Python-based 3D+time fMRI data simulation software, \emph{SNAKE-fMRI}, which stands for \emph{S}imulator from \emph{N}eurovascular coupling to \emph{A}cquisition of \emph{K}-space data for \emph{E}xploration of fMRI acquisition techniques.Unlike existing tools, the goal here is to simulate the complete chain of fMRI data acquisition, from the spatio-temporal design of evoked brain responses to various multi-coil k-space data 3D sampling strategies, with the possibility of extending the forward acquisition model to various noise and artifact sources while remaining memory-efficient.By using this \emph{in silico} setup, we are thus able to provide realistic and reproducible ground truth for fMRI reconstruction methods in 3D accelerated acquisition settings and explore the influence of critical parameters, such as the acceleration factor and signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR), on downstream tasks of image reconstruction and statistical analysis of evoked brain activity.We present three scenarios of increasing complexity to showcase the flexibility, versatility, and fidelity of \emph{SNAKE-fMRI}: From a temporally-fixed full 3D Cartesian to various 3D non-Cartesian sampling patterns, we can compare -- with reproducibility guarantees -- how experimental paradigms, acquisition strategies and reconstruction methods contribute and interact together, affecting the downstream statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Energy-modified Leverage Sampling for Radio Map Construction via Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores an energy-modified leverage sampling strategy for matrix completion in radio map construction. The main goal is to address potential identifiability issues in matrix completion with sparse observations by using a probabilistic sampling approach. Although conventional leverage sampling is commonly employed for designing sampling patterns, it often assigns high sampling probability to locations with low received signal strength (RSS) values, leading to a low sampling efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the leverage score produces pseudo images of sources, and in the regions around the source locations, the leverage probability is asymptotically consistent with the RSS. Based on this finding, an energy-modified leverage probability-based sampling strategy is investigated for efficient sampling. Numerical demonstrations indicate that the proposed sampling strategy can decrease the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of radio map construction by more than 10% for both matrix completion and interpolation-assisted matrix completion schemes, compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Enabled Anti-Detection for Secure Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing reliance on wireless communication and sensing has led to growing concerns over the vulnerability of sensitive information to unauthorized detection and interception. Traditional anti-detection methods are often inadequate, suffering from limited adaptability and diminished effectiveness against advanced detection technologies. To overcome these challenges, this article presents the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) as a groundbreaking technology for enabling flexible electromagnetic manipulation, which has the potential to revolutionize anti-detection in both electromagnetic stealth/spoofing (evading radar detection) and covert communications (facilitating secure information exchange). We explore the fundamental principles of IRS and its advantages over traditional anti-detection techniques and discuss various design challenges associated with implementing IRS-based anti-detection systems. Through the examination of case studies and future research directions, we provide a comprehensive overview of the potential of IRS technology to serve as a formidable shield in the modern wireless landscape.</description>

      <title>Optic Fingerprint: Enhancing Security in Visible Light Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addressing physical layer security issues, hardware fingerprinting has been proven to be a reliable method. Additionally, Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology offers a solution to the spectrum congestion in next-generation wireless communications and is noteworthy for its high security. However, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive and systematic description of the hardware fingerprints and their extraction mechanisms for VLC devices. This study aims to bridge this gap by thoroughly analyzing the hardware fingerprints of VLC devices and proposing an innovative extraction mechanism, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of the physical layer. An Optic Fingerprint (OF) model is proposed based on the LED's inherent circuit characteristics, capable of extracting and processing unique feature vectors with high precision. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the model's efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% accuracy in identifying the same manufactured white LEDs under variable conditions, marking a significant improvement in authentication robustness and interference resistance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formalize an optimization framework for analog beamforming in the context of monostatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where we also address the problem of self-interference in the analog domain. As a result, we derive semidefinite programs to approach detection-optimal transmit and receive beamformers, and we devise a superiorized iterative projection algorithm to approximate them. Our simulations show that this approach outperforms the detection performance of well-known design techniques for ISAC beamforming, while it achieves satisfactory self-interference suppression.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Task Processing over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have expanded the current status of semantic communication limited to processing one task to a more general system that can handle multiple tasks concurrently. In pursuit of this, we first introduced our definition of the "semantic source", enabling the interpretation of multiple semantics based on a single observation. A semantic encoder design is then introduced, featuring the division of the encoder into a common unit and multiple specific units enabling cooperative multi-task processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic source and the system design. Our approach employs information maximization (infomax) and end-to-end design principles.</description>

      <title>SemHARQ: Semantic-Aware HARQ for Multi-task Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent task-oriented semantic communications (SemComs) have witnessed great progress with the development of deep learning (DL). In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware hybrid automatic repeat request (SemHARQ) framework for the robust and efficient transmissions of semantic features. First, to improve the robustness and effectiveness of semantic coding, a multi-task semantic encoder is proposed. Meanwhile, a feature importance ranking (FIR) method is investigated to ensure the important features delivery under limited channel resources. Then, to accurately detect the possible transmission errors, a novel feature distortion evaluation (FDE) network is designed to identify the distortion level of each feature, based on which an efficient HARQ method is proposed. Specifically, the corrupted features are retransmitted, where the remaining channel resources are used for incremental transmissions. The system performance is evaluated under different channel conditions in multi-task scenarios in Internet of Vehicles. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art works by more than 20% in rank-1 accuracy for vehicle re-identification, and 10% in vehicle color classification accuracy in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Non-Orthogonal Unicast Multicast: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal unicast multicast (NOUM) is a variant of multi-antenna multi-user communications where the users desire a shared message (multicast) in addition to their respective unique messages (unicast). The multicast rate is capped in many emerging NOUM applications, such as live-event broadcasting, location-based services and vehicular communications. Given this constraint, we experimentally show that when the user channels are highly correlated, Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-based NOUM can meet the multicast rate while supporting a larger unicast sum rate than conventional multi-user linear precoding (MULP)-based NOUM.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Receiver Impact on Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification via Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI), which exploits non-ideal hardware-induced unique distortion resident in the transmit signals to identify an emitter, is emerging as a means to enhance the security of communication systems. Recently, machine learning has achieved great success in developing state-of-the-art RFFI models. However, few works consider cross-receiver RFFI problems, where the RFFI model is trained and deployed on different receivers. Due to altered receiver characteristics, direct deployment of RFFI model on a new receiver leads to significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we formulate the cross-receiver RFFI as a model adaptation problem, which adapts the trained model to unlabeled signals from a new receiver. We first develop a theoretical generalization error bound for the adaptation model. Motivated by the bound, we propose a novel method to solve the cross-receiver RFFI problem, which includes domain alignment and adaptive pseudo-labeling. The former aims at finding a feature space where both domains exhibit similar distributions, effectively reducing the domain discrepancy. Meanwhile, the latter employs a dynamic pseudo-labeling scheme to implicitly transfer the label information from the labeled receiver to the new receiver. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the receiver impact and improve the cross-receiver RFFI performance.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex Beyond Self-Interference: The Unlimited Sensing Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of full-stack full-duplex communication systems depends on how effectively one can achieve digital self-interference cancellation (SIC). Towards this end, in this paper, we consider unlimited sensing framework (USF) enabled full-duplex system. We show that by injecting folding non-linearities in the sensing pipeline, one can not only suppress self-interference but also recover the signal of interest (SoI). This approach leads to novel design of the receiver architecture that is complemented by a modulo-domain channel estimation method. Numerical experiments show that the USF enabled receiver structure can achieve up to 40 dB digital SIC by using as few as 4-bits per sample. Our method outperforms the previous approach based on adaptive filters when it comes to SoI reconstruction, detection, and digital SIC performance.</description>

      <title>Resource-aware Deployment of Dynamic DNNs over Multi-tiered Interconnected Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing pervasiveness of intelligent mobile applications requires to exploit the full range of resources offered by the mobile-edge-cloud network for the execution of inference tasks. However, due to the heterogeneity of such multi-tiered networks, it is essential to make the applications' demand amenable to the available resources while minimizing energy consumption. Modern dynamic deep neural networks (DNN) achieve this goal by designing multi-branched architectures where early exits enable sample-based adaptation of the model depth. In this paper, we tackle the problem of allocating sections of DNNs with early exits to the nodes of the mobile-edge-cloud system. By envisioning a 3-stage graph-modeling approach, we represent the possible options for splitting the DNN and deploying the DNN blocks on the multi-tiered network, embedding both the system constraints and the application requirements in a convenient and efficient way. Our framework -- named Feasible Inference Graph (FIN) -- can identify the solution that minimizes the overall inference energy consumption while enabling distributed inference over the multi-tiered network with the target quality and latency. Our results, obtained for DNNs with different levels of complexity, show that FIN matches the optimum and yields over 65% energy savings relative to a state-of-the-art technique for cost minimization.</description>

      <title>Physics-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks For Soft Sensing in Industrial Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is reshaping manufacturing, industrial processes, and infrastructure management. By fostering new levels of automation, efficiency, and predictive maintenance, IIoT is transforming traditional industries into intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems. However, achieving highly reliable IIoT can be hindered by factors such as the cost of installing large numbers of sensors, limitations in retrofitting existing systems with sensors, or harsh environmental conditions that may make sensor installation impractical. Soft (virtual) sensing leverages mathematical models to estimate variables from physical sensor data, offering a solution to these challenges. Data-driven and physics-based modeling are the two main methodologies widely used for soft sensing. The choice between these strategies depends on the complexity of the underlying system, with the data-driven approach often being preferred when the physics-based inference models are intricate and present challenges for state estimation. However, conventional deep learning models are typically hindered by their inability to explicitly represent the complex interactions among various sensors. To address this limitation, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), renowned for their ability to effectively capture the complex relationships between sensor measurements. In this research, we propose physics-enhanced GNNs, which integrate principles of physics into graph-based methodologies. This is achieved by augmenting additional nodes in the input graph derived from the underlying characteristics of the physical processes. Our evaluation of the proposed methodology on the case study of district heating networks reveals significant improvements over purely data-driven GNNs, even in the presence of noise and parameter inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning of Range-Dependent Transmission Loss for Underwater Acoustic using Conditional Convolutional Neural Net</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a significant need for precise and reliable forecasting of the far-field noise emanating from shipping vessels. Conventional full-order models based on the Navier-Stokes equations are unsuitable, and sophisticated model reduction methods may be ineffective for accurately predicting far-field noise in environments with seamounts and significant variations in bathymetry. Recent advances in reduced-order models, particularly those based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, offer a faster and more accurate alternative. These models use convolutional neural networks to reduce data dimensions effectively. However, current deep-learning models face challenges in predicting wave propagation over long periods and for remote locations, often relying on auto-regressive prediction and lacking far-field bathymetry information. This research aims to improve the accuracy of deep-learning models for predicting underwater radiated noise in far-field scenarios. We propose a novel range-conditional convolutional neural network that incorporates ocean bathymetry data into the input. By integrating this architecture into a continual learning framework, we aim to generalize the model for varying bathymetry worldwide. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we analyze our model on several test cases and a benchmark scenario involving far-field prediction over Dickin's seamount in the Northeast Pacific. Our proposed architecture effectively captures transmission loss over a range-dependent, varying bathymetry profile. This architecture can be integrated into an adaptive management system for underwater radiated noise, providing real-time end-to-end mapping between near-field ship noise sources and received noise at the marine mammal's location.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Weighted Moving Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exponentially weighted moving model (EWMM) for a vector time series fits a new data model each time period, based on an exponentially fading loss function on past observed data. The well known and widely used exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is a special case that estimates the mean using a square loss function. For quadratic loss functions EWMMs can be fit using a simple recursion that updates the parameters of a quadratic function. For other loss functions, the entire past history must be stored, and the fitting problem grows in size as time increases. We propose a general method for computing an approximation of EWMM, which requires storing only a window of a fixed number of past samples, and uses an additional quadratic term to approximate the loss associated with the data before the window. This approximate EWMM relies on convex optimization, and solves problems that do not grow with time. We compare the estimates produced by our approximation with the estimates from the exact EWMM method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Universal Quantum Encoding for Statistical Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal encoding of classical data for statistical inference using quantum computing is investigated. A universal encoder is sought that is optimal for a wide array of statistical inference tasks. Accuracy of any statistical inference is shown to be upper bounded by a term that is proportional to maximal quantum leakage from the classical data, i.e., the input to the inference model, through its quantum encoding. This demonstrates that the maximal quantum leakage is a universal measure of the quality of the encoding strategy for statistical inference as it only depends on the quantum encoding of the data and not the inference task itself. The optimal universal encoding strategy, i.e., the encoding strategy that maximizes the maximal quantum leakage, is proved to be attained by pure states. When there are enough qubits, basis encoding is proved to be universally optimal. An iterative method for numerically computing the optimal universal encoding strategy is presented.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system stands out as a pivotal usage scenario of 6G. To explore the coordination gains offered by the ISAC technique, this paper introduces a novel communication-assisted sensing (CAS) system. The CAS system can endow users with beyond-line-of-sight sensing capability, wherein the base station with favorable visibility senses device-free targets, simultaneously transmitting the acquired sensory information to users. Within the CAS framework, we characterize the fundamental limits to reveal the achievable distortion between the state of the targets of interest and their reconstruction at the users' end. Finally, within the confines of this theoretical framework, we employ a typical application as an illustrative example to demonstrate the minimization of distortion through dual-functional waveform design, showcasing the potential of CAS in enhancing sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>OTFS Channel Estimation and Detection for Channels with Very Large Delay Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In low latency applications and in general, for overspread channels, channel delay spread is a large percentage of the transmission frame duration. In this paper, we consider OTFS in an overspread channel exhibiting a delay spread that exceeds the block duration in a frame, where traditional channel estimation (CE) fails. We propose a two-stage CE method based on a delay-Doppler (DD) training frame, consisting of a dual chirp converted from time domain and a higher power pilot. The first stage employs a DD domain embedded pilot CE to estimate the aliased delays (due to modulo operation) and Doppler shifts, followed by identifying all the underspread paths not coinciding with any overspread path. The second stage utilizes time domain dual chirp correlation to estimate the actual delays and Doppler shifts of the remaining paths. This stage also resolves ambiguity in estimating delays and Doppler shifts for paths sharing same aliased delay. Furthermore, we present a modified low-complexity maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection algorithm for OTFS in overspread channels. Finally, we evaluate performance of OTFS using the proposed CE and the modified MRC detection in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER).</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Reactive Region on the Near-Field Channel Gain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The near-field channel gain is analyzed by considering both radiating and reactive components of the electromagnetic field. Novel expressions are derived for the channel gains of spatially-discrete (SPD) and continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays, which are more accurate than conventional results that neglect the reactive region. To gain further insights, asymptotic analyses are carried out in the large aperture size, based on which the impact of the reactive region is discussed. It is proved that for both SPD and CAP arrays, the impact of the reactive region on near-field channel gain is negligible, even as the array aperture size approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised k-Space Regularization for Motion-Resolved Abdominal MRI Using Neural Implicit k-Space Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit k-space representations have shown promising results for dynamic MRI at high temporal resolutions. Yet, their exclusive training in k-space limits the application of common image regularization methods to improve the final reconstruction. In this work, we introduce the concept of parallel imaging-inspired self-consistency (PISCO), which we incorporate as novel self-supervised k-space regularization enforcing a consistent neighborhood relationship. At no additional data cost, the proposed regularization significantly improves neural implicit k-space reconstructions on simulated data. Abdominal in-vivo reconstructions using PISCO result in enhanced spatio-temporal image quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/vjspi/PISCO-NIK.</description>

      <title>Seismic First Break Picking in a Higher Dimension Using Deep Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary automatic first break (FB) picking methods typically analyze 1D signals, 2D source gathers, or 3D source-receiver gathers. Utilizing higher-dimensional data, such as 2D or 3D, incorporates global features, improving the stability of local picking. Despite the benefits, high-dimensional data requires structured input and increases computational demands. Addressing this, we propose a novel approach using deep graph learning called DGL-FB, constructing a large graph to efficiently extract information. In this graph, each seismic trace is represented as a node, connected by edges that reflect similarities. To manage the size of the graph, we develop a subgraph sampling technique to streamline model training and inference. Our proposed framework, DGL-FB, leverages deep graph learning for FB picking. It encodes subgraphs into global features using a deep graph encoder. Subsequently, the encoded global features are combined with local node signals and fed into a ResUNet-based 1D segmentation network for FB detection. Field survey evaluations of DGL-FB show superior accuracy and stability compared to a 2D U-Net-based benchmark method.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Joint Antenna Selection and Precoding Design for Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a downlink cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network in which multiple multi-antenna base stations (BSs) serve multiple users via coherent joint transmission. In order to reduce the energy consumption by radio frequency components, each BS selects a subset of antennas for downlink data transmission after estimating the channel state information (CSI). We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each BS, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the BSs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.</description>

      <title>Average Communication Rate for Event-Triggered Stochastic Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the average communication rate (ACR) of a networked event-triggered stochastic control system (NET-SCS) with deterministic thresholds is challenging due to the non-stationary nature of the system's stochastic processes. For a NET-SCS, the nonlinear statistics propagation of the network communication status brought up by deterministic thresholds makes the precise computation of ACR difficult. Previous work used to over-simplify the computation using a Gaussian distribution without incorporating this nonlinearity, leading to sacrificed precision. This paper proposes both analytical and numerical approaches to predict the exact ACR for a NET-SCS using a recursive model. We use theoretical analysis and a numerical study to qualitatively evaluate the deviation gap of the conventional approach that ignores the side information. The accuracy of our proposed method, alongside its comparison with the simplified results of the conventional approach, is validated by experimental studies. Our work is promising to benefit the efficient resource planning of networked control systems with limited communication resources by providing accurate ACR computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, performance bounds for the multi-antenna near-field range estimation of extended targets are provided. First, analytic expressions of the ambiguity functions are obtained, emphasising the cooperation between the waveform delay and the near-field phase shift information. The impact of estimating the range of an extended target with a point target model is analysed, showing that a model mismatch leads to severe performance degradation in the near-field region. Secondly, Cramer-Rao bounds are derived. Expressions emphasising the parameters' impact are obtained, the parameters being the carrier frequency, and the central frequency and root-mean-square bandwidth of the waveform. The near-field range information is shown to depend on the root-mean-square value of the propagation delay derivatives, this value scaling with the fourth power of the ratio between the antenna array dimension and the target range.</description>

      <title>Calibration-Aware Bayesian Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models, including modern systems like large language models, are well known to offer unreliable estimates of the uncertainty of their decisions. In order to improve the quality of the confidence levels, also known as calibration, of a model, common approaches entail the addition of either data-dependent or data-independent regularization terms to the training loss. Data-dependent regularizers have been recently introduced in the context of conventional frequentist learning to penalize deviations between confidence and accuracy. In contrast, data-independent regularizers are at the core of Bayesian learning, enforcing adherence of the variational distribution in the model parameter space to a prior density. The former approach is unable to quantify epistemic uncertainty, while the latter is severely affected by model misspecification. In light of the limitations of both methods, this paper proposes an integrated framework, referred to as calibration-aware Bayesian neural networks (CA-BNNs), that applies both regularizers while optimizing over a variational distribution as in Bayesian learning. Numerical results validate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of expected calibration error (ECE) and reliability diagrams.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) features of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) fundamentally determine their operating principles and performance. Motivated by these considerations, we study a single-input single-output (SISO) system in the presence of an RIS, which is characterized by a circuit-based EM-consistent model. Specifically, we model the RIS as a collection of thin wire dipoles controlled by tunable load impedances, and we propose a gradient-based algorithm for calculating the optimal impedances of the scattering elements of the RIS in the presence of mutual coupling. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and derive its computational complexity in terms of number of complex multiplications. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm provides better performance and converges faster than a benchmark algorithm.</description>

Abstract: A different method of discovering how neurons are connected to process information is presented here: Design a simple logic circuit that can perform a single, biologically advantageous function. Engineering concepts can be helpful in choosing the function and in designing the logic circuit. Several implementations of the method are reviewed to demonstrate how a biologically advantageous function can be chosen, how one simple network can generate major phenomena that are widely considered unrelated, and how one network design can lead to others that explain entirely different aspects of the brain. These results show that the method can benefit neuromorphic engineering as well as neuroscience, and that some brain functions can be carried out remarkably simply, at least in principle if not in the details.</description>

      <title>Beamfocusing Optimization for Near-Field Wideband Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16861v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A near-field wideband communication system is investigated in which a base station (BS) employs an extra-large scale antenna array (ELAA) to serve multiple users in its near-field region. To facilitate near-field multi-user beamforming and mitigate the spatial wideband effect, the BS employs a hybrid beamforming architecture based on true-time delayers (TTDs). In addition to the conventional fully-connected TTD-based hybrid beamforming architecture, a new sub-connected architecture is proposed to improve energy efficiency and reduce hardware requirements. Two wideband beamforming optimization approaches are proposed to maximize spectral efficiency for both architectures. 1) Fully-digital approximation (FDA) approach based on full channel state information (CSI): In this method, the TTD-based hybrid beamformer is optimized by the block-coordinate descent and penalty method to approximate the optimal digital beamformer. This approach ensures convergence to the stationary point of the spectral efficiency maximization problem. 2) Heuristic two-stage (HTS) approach based on partial CSI: In this approach, a piecewise-near-field approximation of near-field channels is first proposed to facilitate the design of TTD-based analog beamformers based on the outcomes of near-field beam training. Subsequently, the low-dimensional digital beamformer is optimized using knowledge of the low-dimensional equivalent channels, resulting in reduced computational complexity and channel estimation complexity. Our numerical results show that 1) the proposed approach effectively eliminates the spatial wideband effect, and 2) the proposed sub-connected architecture is more energy efficient and has fewer hardware constraints on the TTD and system bandwidth compared to the fully-connected architecture.</description>

Abstract: The novel concept of near-field velocity sensing is proposed. In contrast to far-field velocity sensing, near-field velocity sensing enables the simultaneous estimation of both radial and transverse velocities of a moving target. A maximum-likelihood-based method is proposed for jointly estimating the radial and transverse velocities from the echo signals. Assisted by near-field velocity sensing, a predictive beamforming framework is proposed for a moving communication user, which requires no channel estimation but achieves seamless data transmission. Finally, numerical examples validate the proposed approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the irregular electrical activity of atrial fibrillation (AFib) has been a key challenge in electrocardiography. For serious cases of AFib, catheter ablations are performed to collect intracardiac electrograms (EGMs). EGMs offer intricately detailed and localized electrical activity of the heart and are an ideal modality for interpretable cardiac studies. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has allowed some works to utilize deep learning frameworks to interpret EGMs during AFib. Additionally, language models (LMs) have shown exceptional performance in being able to generalize to unseen domains, especially in healthcare. In this study, we are the first to leverage pretrained LMs for finetuning of EGM interpolation and AFib classification via masked language modeling. We formulate the EGM as a textual sequence and present competitive performances on AFib classification compared against other representations. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive interpretability study to provide a multi-perspective intuition of the model's behavior, which could greatly benefit the clinical use.</description>

Abstract: Telecommunications and computer vision have evolved separately so far. Yet, with the shift to sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and terahertz (THz) radio communications, there is an opportunity to explore computer vision technologies together with radio communications, considering the dependency of both technologies on Line of Sight. The combination of radio sensing and computer vision can address challenges such as obstructions and poor lighting. Also, machine learning algorithms, capable of processing multimodal data, play a crucial role in deriving insights from raw and low-level sensing data, offering a new level of abstraction that can enhance various applications and use cases such as beamforming and terminal handovers.
  This paper introduces CONVERGE, a pioneering vision-radio paradigm that bridges this gap by leveraging Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) to facilitate a dual "View-to-Communicate, Communicate-to-View" approach. CONVERGE offers tools that merge wireless communications and computer vision, establishing a novel Research Infrastructure (RI) that will be open to the scientific community and capable of providing open datasets. This new infrastructure will support future research in 6G and beyond concerning multiple verticals, such as telecommunications, automotive, manufacturing, media, and health.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of two revolutionary technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, to enhance high-speed wireless communications. We introduce a novel phase shift design algorithm for RIS-assisted OTFS, optimizing energy reception and channel gain in dynamic environments. The study evaluates the proposed approach in a downlink scenario, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to benchmark schemes in the literature, particularly in terms of bit error rate (BER). Our results showcase the potential of RIS to enhance the system's performance. Specifically, our proposed phase shift design technique outperforms the benchmark solutions by over 4 dB. Furthermore, even greater gains can be obtained as the number of RIS elements increases.</description>
