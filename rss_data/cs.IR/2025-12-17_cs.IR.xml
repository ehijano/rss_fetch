      <title>BiCoRec: Bias-Mitigated Context-Aware Sequential Recommendation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation models aim to learn from users evolving preferences. However, current state-of-the-art models suffer from an inherent popularity bias. This study developed a novel framework, BiCoRec, that adaptively accommodates users changing preferences for popular and niche items. Our approach leverages a co-attention mechanism to obtain a popularity-weighted user sequence representation, facilitating more accurate predictions. We then present a new training scheme that learns from future preferences using a consistency loss function. BiCoRec aimed to improve the recommendation performance of users who preferred niche items. For these users, BiCoRec achieves a 26.00% average improvement in NDCG@10 over state-of-the-art baselines. When ranking the relevant item against the entire collection, BiCoRec achieves NDCG@10 scores of 0.0102, 0.0047, 0.0021, and 0.0005 for the Movies, Fashion, Games and Music datasets.</description>

      <title>Intent-Guided Reasoning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aim to capture users' evolving preferences from their interaction histories. Recent reasoningenhanced methods have shown promise by introducing deliberate, chain-of-thought-like processes with intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods rely solely on the next target item as supervision, leading to two critical issues: (1) reasoning instability--the process becomes overly sensitive to recent behaviors and spurious interactions like accidental clicks, and (2) surface-level reasoning--the model memorizes item-to-item transitions rather than understanding intrinsic behavior patterns. To address these challenges, we propose IGR-SR, an Intent-Guided Reasoning framework for Sequential Recommendation that anchors the reasoning process to explicitly extracted high-level intents. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Latent Intent Distiller (LID) that efficiently extracts multi-faceted intents using a frozen encoder with learnable tokens, (2) an Intent-aware Deliberative Reasoner (IDR) that decouples reasoning into intent deliberation and decision-making via a dual-attention architecture, and (3) an Intent Consistency Regularization (ICR) that ensures robustness by enforcing consistent representations across different intent views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that IGR-SR achieves an average 7.13% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Critically, under 20% behavioral noise, IGR-SR degrades only 10.4% compared to 16.2% and 18.6% for competing methods, validating the effectiveness and robustness of intent-guided reasoning.</description>

      <title>DTRec: Learning Dynamic Reasoning Trajectories for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by advances in LLMs, reasoning-enhanced sequential recommendation performs multi-step deliberation before making final predictions, unlocking greater potential for capturing user preferences. However, current methods are constrained by static reasoning trajectories that are ill-suited for the diverse complexity of user behaviors. They suffer from two key limitations: (1) a static reasoning direction, which uses flat supervision signals misaligned with human-like hierarchical reasoning, and (2) a fixed reasoning depth, which inefficiently applies the same computational effort to all users, regardless of pattern complexity. These rigidity lead to suboptimal performance and significant computational waste. To overcome these challenges, we propose DTRec, a novel and effective framework that explores the Dynamic reasoning Trajectory for Sequential Recommendation along both direction and depth. To guide the direction, we develop Hierarchical Process Supervision (HPS), which provides coarse-to-fine supervisory signals to emulate the natural, progressive refinement of human cognitive processes. To optimize the depth, we introduce the Adaptive Reasoning Halting (ARH) mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning steps by jointly monitoring three indicators. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving up to a 24.5% performance improvement over strong baselines while simultaneously reducing computational cost by up to 41.6%.</description>

      <title>From Feature Interaction to Feature Generation: A Generative Paradigm of CTR Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems, aims to estimate the probability of users clicking on items. Existing models predominantly follow a discriminative paradigm, which relies heavily on explicit interactions between raw ID embeddings. However, this paradigm inherently renders them susceptible to two critical issues: embedding dimensional collapse and information redundancy, stemming from the over-reliance on feature interactions \emph{over raw ID embeddings}. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \emph{Supervised Feature Generation (SFG)} framework, \emph{shifting the paradigm from discriminative ``feature interaction" to generative ``feature generation"}. Specifically, SFG comprises two key components: an \emph{Encoder} that constructs hidden embeddings for each feature, and a \emph{Decoder} tasked with regenerating the feature embeddings of all features from these hidden representations. Unlike existing generative approaches that adopt self-supervised losses, we introduce a supervised loss to utilize the supervised signal, \ie, click or not, in the CTR prediction task. This framework exhibits strong generalizability: it can be seamlessly integrated with most existing CTR models, reformulating them under the generative paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFG consistently mitigates embedding collapse and reduces information redundancy, while yielding substantial performance gains across various datasets and base models. The code is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/GE4Rec.</description>

      <title>AsarRec: Adaptive Sequential Augmentation for Robust Self-supervised Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling users' dynamic preferences and capturing item transition patterns. However, real-world user behaviors are often noisy due to factors such as human errors, uncertainty, and behavioral ambiguity, which can lead to degraded recommendation performance. To address this issue, recent approaches widely adopt self-supervised learning (SSL), particularly contrastive learning, by generating perturbed views of user interaction sequences and maximizing their mutual information to improve model robustness. However, these methods heavily rely on their pre-defined static augmentation strategies~(where the augmentation type remains fixed once chosen) to construct augmented views, leading to two critical challenges: (1) the optimal augmentation type can vary significantly across different scenarios; (2) inappropriate augmentations may even degrade recommendation performance, limiting the effectiveness of SSL. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive augmentation framework. We first unify existing basic augmentation operations into a unified formulation via structured transformation matrices. Building on this, we introduce AsarRec (Adaptive Sequential Augmentation for Robust Sequential Recommendation), which learns to generate transformation matrices by encoding user sequences into probabilistic transition matrices and projecting them into hard semi-doubly stochastic matrices via a differentiable Semi-Sinkhorn algorithm. To ensure that the learned augmentations benefit downstream performance, we jointly optimize three objectives: diversity, semantic invariance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets under varying noise levels validate the effectiveness of AsarRec, demonstrating its superior robustness and consistent improvements.</description>

      <title>SPARQL-LLM: Real-Time SPARQL Query Generation from Natural Language Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications. One such application deployed over real-world decentralized knowledge graphs can be found at https://www.expasy.org/chat.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Context Selection for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Mitigating Distractors and Positional Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model performance by incorporating external knowledge retrieved from large corpora, which makes it highly suitable for tasks such as open domain question answering. Standard RAG systems typically rely on a fixed top k retrieval strategy, which can either miss relevant information or introduce semantically irrelevant passages, known as distractors, that degrade output quality. Additionally, the positioning of retrieved passages within the input context can influence the model attention and generation outcomes. Context placed in the middle tends to be overlooked, which is an issue known as the "lost in the middle" phenomenon. In this work, we systematically analyze the impact of distractors on generation quality, and quantify their effects under varying conditions. We also investigate how the position of relevant passages within the context window affects their influence on generation. Building on these insights, we propose a context-size classifier that dynamically predicts the optimal number of documents to retrieve based on query-specific informational needs. We integrate this approach into a full RAG pipeline, and demonstrate improved performance over fixed k baselines.</description>

      <title>PushGen: Push Notifications Generation with LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PushGen, an automated framework for generating high-quality push notifications comparable to human-crafted content. With the rise of generative models, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs for push content generation. Although LLMs make content generation straightforward and cost-effective, maintaining stylistic control and reliable quality assessment remains challenging, as both directly impact user engagement. To address these issues, PushGen combines two key components: (1) a controllable category prompt technique to guide LLM outputs toward desired styles, and (2) a reward model that ranks and selects generated candidates. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, which has been deployed in large-scale industrial applications, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.</description>

      <title>RecGPT-V2 Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning. While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.
  To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER. RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Comparison for Bias Identification and Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linguistic bias in online news and social media is widespread but difficult to measure. Yet, its identification and quantification remain difficult due to subjectivity, context dependence, and the scarcity of high-quality gold-label datasets. We aim to reduce annotation effort by leveraging pairwise comparison for bias annotation. To overcome the costliness of the approach, we evaluate more efficient implementations of pairwise comparison-based rating. We achieve this by investigating the effects of various rating techniques and the parameters of three cost-aware alternatives in a simulation environment. Since the approach can in principle be applied to both human and large language model annotation, our work provides a basis for creating high-quality benchmark datasets and for quantifying biases and other subjective linguistic aspects.
  The controlled simulations include latent severity distributions, distance-calibrated noise, and synthetic annotator bias to probe robustness and cost-quality trade-offs. In applying the approach to human-labeled bias benchmark datasets, we then evaluate the most promising setups and compare them to direct assessment by large language models and unmodified pairwise comparison labels as baselines. Our findings support the use of pairwise comparison as a practical foundation for quantifying subjective linguistic aspects, enabling reproducible bias analysis. We contribute an optimization of comparison and matchmaking components, an end-to-end evaluation including simulation and real-data application, and an implementation blueprint for cost-aware large-scale annotation</description>

      <title>Neurosymbolic Inference On Foundation Models For Remote Sensing Text-to-image Retrieval With Complex Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing (RS) has advanced rapidly with the rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) tailored for aerial and satellite imagery, culminating in remote sensing large vision-language models (RS-LVLMS). However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Techniques for Bengali Standard-to-Dialect Machine Translation Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\_dialect:standard\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\% to 55\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.</description>

      <title>Can Offline Metrics Measure Explanation Goals? A Comparative Survey Analysis of Offline Explanation Metrics in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14379v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Recommender System (RS), explanations help users understand why items are recommended and can enhance a system's transparency, persuasiveness, engagement, and trust, which are known as explanation goals. However, evaluating the effectiveness of explanation algorithms offline remains challenging because explanation goals are inherently subjective. We initially conducted a rapid literature review, which revealed that algorithms are often assessed using anecdotal evidence (offering convincing examples) or using metrics that do not align with human perception. From these results, we investigated whether the selection of item attributes and interacted items affects explanation goals in explanations that generate a path connecting interacted and recommended items based on shared attributes (such as genres). We used metrics that measure the diversity and popularity of attributes and the recency of item interactions to evaluate explanations from three state-of-the-art agnostic algorithms across six recommendation systems. We then performed an online user study to compare user perceptions of explanation goals and offline metrics. Our findings indicate that engagement is sensitive to users' perceptions of diversity in explanations, whereas transparency, trust, and persuasiveness are influenced by perceptions of both popularity and diversity. However, offline metrics require refinement to more closely align with explanation goals and user understanding.</description>

      <title>Holistic Utility Preference Learning for Listwise Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18127</link>

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is essential for improving interaction quality and safety by ensuring outputs better reflect human values. A promising strategy involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), starting with collecting and ranking responses generated by a supervised fine-tuning model to refine alignment. Existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) focus on pairwise comparisons, categorizing responses into preferred and less preferred pairs and optimizing pairwise margins. However, this pairwise approach cannot capture the holistic ranking relationships among multiple responses or effectively leverage the rich preference information available in list-wise comparisons. To address this challenge, this paper introduces \underline{D}irect \underline{R}anking \underline{P}reference \underline{O}ptimization (DRPO), a novel method that views human preference alignment as a Learning-to-Rank (LTR) task. Unlike pairwise methods, DRPO optimizes the preference ranking of entire response lists by computing holistic utility scores through NDCG, a standard LTR metric. To enable end-to-end optimization with the non-differentiable NDCG, we propose diffNDCG loss, a differentiable approximation facilitated by a sorting network. Furthermore, we introduce a novel margin-based Adaptive Rank Policy Score to enhance the discriminative quality of generated responses. Extensive experiments have shown that DRPO outperforms existing methods, enhancing the quality of the generated responses.</description>

      <title>SymCERE: Symmetric Contrastive Learning for Robust Review-Enhanced Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern recommendation systems fuse user behavior graphs and review texts but often encounter a "Fusion Gap" caused by False Negatives, Popularity Bias, and Signal Ambiguity. We propose SymCERE (Symmetric NCE), a contrastive learning framework bridging this gap via structural geometric alignment. First, we introduce a symmetric NCE loss that leverages full interaction history to exclude false negatives. Second, we integrate L2 normalization to structurally neutralize popularity bias. Experiments on 15 datasets (e-commerce, local reviews, travel) demonstrate that SymCERE outperforms strong baselines, improving NDCG@10 by up to 43.6%. Notably, we validate this on raw reviews, addressing significant noise. Analysis reveals "Semantic Anchoring," where the model aligns on objective vocabulary (e.g., "OEM," "gasket") rather than generic sentiment. This indicates effective alignment stems from extracting factual attributes, offering a path toward robust, interpretable systems. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReviewGNN-2E1E.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-RAG: Integrating Text and Tables with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve optimal utility when their responses are grounded in external knowledge sources. However, real-world documents, such as annual reports, scientific papers, and clinical guidelines, frequently combine extensive narrative content with complex, hierarchically structured tables. While existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems effectively integrate LLMs' generative capabilities with external retrieval-based information, their performance significantly deteriorates especially processing such heterogeneous text-table hierarchies. To address this limitation, we formalize the task of Heterogeneous Document RAG, which requires joint retrieval and reasoning across textual and hierarchical tabular data. We propose MixRAG, a novel three-stage framework: (i) hierarchy row-and-column-level (H-RCL) representation that preserves hierarchical structure and heterogeneous relationship, (ii) an ensemble retriever with LLM-based reranking for evidence alignment, and (iii) multi-step reasoning decomposition via a RECAP prompt strategy. To bridge the gap in available data for this domain, we release the dataset DocRAGLib, a 2k-document corpus paired with automatically aligned text-table summaries and gold document annotations. The comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that MixRAG boosts top-1 retrieval by 46% over strong text-only, table-only, and naive-mixture baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for mixed-modality document grounding.</description>

      <title>A Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Algorithm Selection in the Facility Layout Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an NP-hard optimization problem with multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task that requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the problem, such as the number of facilities, objectives, and constraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to guide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a new recommendation method to make this expertise accessible, based on a Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework. In this framework, a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) is constructed from the literature. The method then employs a multifaceted retrieval mechanism to gather relevant evidence from this KG using three distinct approaches: precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based search, and cluster-based high-level search. The retrieved evidence is utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations based on data-driven reasoning. This KG-RAG framework is tested on a use case consisting of six problems comprising of complex multi-objective and multi-constraint FLP case. The results are compared with the Gemini 1.5 Flash chatbot. The results show that KG-RAG achieves an average reasoning score of 4.7 out of 5 compared to 3.3 for the baseline chatbot.</description>

      <title>ModernVBERT: Towards Smaller Visual Document Retrievers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieving specific information from a large corpus of documents is a prevalent industrial use case of modern AI, notably due to the popularity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Although neural document retrieval models have historically operated exclusively in the text space, Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) models - large vision-language decoders repurposed as embedding models which directly work with page screenshots as inputs - are increasingly popular due to the performance and indexing latency gains they offer. In this work, we show that, while cost-efficient, this approach of repurposing generative models bottlenecks retrieval performance. Through controlled experiments, we revisit the entire training pipeline, and establish a principled recipe for improving visual document retrieval models. We notably measure the impact of attention masking, image resolution, modality alignment data regimes, and late interaction centered contrastive objectives which emerge as central performance factors. Building on these insights, we release ModernVBERT, a compact 250M-parameter vision-language encoder that outperforms recent models up to 10 times larger when fine-tuned on document retrieval tasks, enabling efficient inference on cheap CPU hardware and greatly reducing latency and costs while maintaining strong performance. Models, code and data are available at https://huggingface.co/ModernVBERT.</description>

      <title>Cog-RAG: Cognitive-Inspired Dual-Hypergraph with Theme Alignment Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response quality and domain-specific performance of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge to combat hallucinations. In recent research, graph structures have been integrated into RAG to enhance the capture of semantic relations between entities. However, it primarily focuses on low-order pairwise entity relations, limiting the high-order associations among multiple entities. Hypergraph-enhanced approaches address this limitation by modeling multi-entity interactions via hyperedges, but they are typically constrained to inter-chunk entity-level representations, overlooking the global thematic organization and alignment across chunks. Drawing inspiration from the top-down cognitive process of human reasoning, we propose a theme-aligned dual-hypergraph RAG framework (Cog-RAG) that uses a theme hypergraph to capture inter-chunk thematic structure and an entity hypergraph to model high-order semantic relations. Furthermore, we design a cognitive-inspired two-stage retrieval strategy that first activates query-relevant thematic content from the theme hypergraph, and then guides fine-grained recall and diffusion in the entity hypergraph, achieving semantic alignment and consistent generation from global themes to local details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Cog-RAG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>CrossPT-EEG: A Benchmark for Cross-Participant and Cross-Time Generalization of EEG-based Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring brain activity in relation to visual perception provides insights into the biological representation of the world. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have enabled effective image classification and reconstruction, their high cost and bulk limit practical use. Electroencephalography (EEG), by contrast, offers low cost and excellent temporal resolution, but its potential has been limited by the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets and by block-design experiments that introduce temporal confounds. To fill this gap, we present CrossPT-EEG, a benchmark for cross-participant and cross-time generalization of visual decoding from EEG. We collected EEG data from 16 participants while they viewed 4,000 images sampled from ImageNet, with image stimuli annotated at multiple levels of granularity. Our design includes two stages separated in time to allow cross-time generalization and avoid block-design artifacts. We also introduce benchmarks tailored to non-block design classification, as well as pre-training experiments to assess cross-time and cross-participant generalization. These findings highlight the dataset's potential to enhance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, deepen our understanding of visual perception in biological systems, and suggest promising applications for improving machine vision models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Large Language Models for ESG Activity Detection in Financial Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into corporate decision-making is a fundamental aspect of sustainable finance. However, ensuring that business practices align with evolving regulatory frameworks remains a persistent challenge. AI-driven solutions for automatically assessing the alignment of sustainability reports and non-financial disclosures with specific ESG activities could greatly support this process. Yet, this task remains complex due to the limitations of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts and the scarcity of structured, high-quality datasets. In this paper, we investigate the ability of current-generation LLMs to identify text related to environmental activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their performance can be significantly enhanced through fine-tuning on a combination of original and synthetically generated data. To this end, we introduce ESG-Activities, a benchmark dataset containing 1,325 labelled text segments classified according to the EU ESG taxonomy. Our experimental results show that fine-tuning on ESG-Activities significantly enhances classification accuracy, with open models such as Llama 7B and Gemma 7B outperforming large proprietary solutions in specific configurations. These findings have important implications for financial analysts, policymakers, and AI researchers seeking to enhance ESG transparency and compliance through advanced natural language processing techniques.</description>

      <title>RAGRank: Using PageRank to Counter Poisoning in CTI LLM Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant architectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.</description>
