      <title>Optimization of Nuclear Mass Models Using Algorithms and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking into account nucleon-nucleon gravitational interaction, higher-order terms of symmetry energy, pairing interaction, and neural network corrections, a new BW4 mass model has been developed, which more accurately reflects the contributions of various terms to the binding energy. A novel hybrid algorithm and neural network correction method has been implemented to optimize the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results, significantly improving the model's binding energy predictions (reduced to around 350 keV). At the same time, the theoretical accuracy near magic nuclei has been marginally enhanced, effectively capturing the special interaction effects around magic nuclei and showing good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24 qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement ($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell, dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion. These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.</description>

      <title>Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density. This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.</description>

      <title>Pion Boer-Mulders function using a contact interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI) is used as the basis for calculations of the two pion transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs); namely, that for unpolarised valence degrees-of-freedom and the analogous Boer-Mulders (BM) function. Amongst other things, the analysis enables the following themes to be addressed: the quark current mass dependence of pion TMDs; the impact of the gauge link model on the positivity constraint that bounds the BM function relative to the unpolarised TMD; the equivalence of direct diagrammatic and light-front wave function TMD calculations; and the size of the BM shift. Interpreted astutely, these SCI results enable one to draw insightful pictures of pion TMDs.</description>

      <title>Photo-nuclear reaction rates of $^{157,159}$Ho and $^{163,165}$Tm and their impact in the $\gamma$--process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable photo-nuclear reaction rates at the stellar conditions are essential to understand the origin of the heavy stable neutron-deficient isotopes between $^{74}$Se and $^{196}$Hg-p-nuclei, however, many reaction rates of relevance still have to rely on the Hauser-Feshbach model due to rare experimental progress. One such case is in the mass range of 160 for Dy, Er, Ho and Tm isotopes. In this work we attempt to constrain the Hauser-Feshbach model in the TALYS package by reproducing the available experimental data of $^{160}$Dy($p,\gamma$)$^{161}$Ho and $^{162}$Er($p,\gamma$)$^{163}$Tm in the $A\sim 160$ mass region, and examine the effects of level density, gamma strength function and the optical model potential. The constrained model then allows us to calculate the reaction rates of $^{157, 159}$Ho($\gamma$, $p$) and $^{163,165}$Tm($\gamma$, $p$) for the $\gamma$-process nucleosynthesis in carbon-deflagration SNe Ia model. Our recommended rates differ from the JINA REACLIB by more than 1 order of magnitude in the temperature range of 2-3 GK. This results in the changes of final abundance of $p$-nuclei in the $A\sim 160$ mass range by -5.5-3\% from those with JINA, which means that the ($\gamma$, $p$) reactions uncertainty is not predominant for the synthesis of these nuclei.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows $v_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat \gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow $v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play in this process.</description>

      <title>Electric conductivity of hot and dense nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport coefficients play an important role in characterising hot and dense nuclear matter, such as that created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC). In the present work we calculate the electric conductivity of hot and dense hadronic matter by extracting it from the electromagnetic spectral function, through its zero energy limit at vanishing 3-momentum. We utilise the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\rho$ meson. Therefore, we use hadronic many-body theory to calculate the $\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\pi$-$\rho$, $\pi$-$\sigma$, $\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\Delta$-hole loops. We then introduce vertex corrections to maintain gauge invariance. Finally, we analyze the low-energy transport peak as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential, and extract the conductivity along a proposed phase transition line.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supra nuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star's internal properties. The misalignment of a star's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, \emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\zeta \lesssim 10^{31} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\eta \lesssim 10^{28} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Ultracollinear Paradox with Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Naive intuition about scale decoupling breaks down in the presence of fermion masses. Kinematic enhancements can greatly extend the range where one needs to keep a finite mass in calculations to obtain a correct result at even the O(1) level. Treating a light fermion as massive though, leads to a known but somewhat obscure paradox, a seeming leading-order sensitivity to an arbitrarily small mass. We show how a proper formulation in effective field theory not only resolves the physical conundrum, but answers the very practical question of when fermion masses are required. This has important implications for the development of shower Monte Carlo above the weak scale.</description>

      <title>Dissipative tidal effects to next-to-leading order and constraints on the dissipative tidal deformability using gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative tidal interactions can be used to probe the out-of-equilibrium physics of neutron stars using gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we present the first post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the orbital dynamics of a binary system containing objects whose tidal interactions have a dissipative contribution. We derive the 1PN-accurate equations of motion in the center-of-mass frame and a generalized energy-balance law that is valid for dissipative tidal interactions. We show how mass and energy loss due to the absorption of orbital energy change the orbital dynamics and derive the next-to-leading order correction to the gravitational wave phase of a binary system in a quasi-circular orbit containing initially non-spinning components. We then use this waveform model to constrain, for the first time, the individual dissipative tidal deformabilities of each of the binary components that generated the GW170817 event using real data. We find that the GW170817 data requires $\Xi_{1} \lesssim 1121$ and $\Xi_{2} \lesssim 1692$ at 90\% confidence, where $\Xi_{1,2}$ are the individual tidal deformabilities of the primary and secondary binary components that produced the GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Review of nonflow estimation methods and uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective anisotropic flow, where particles are correlated over the entire event, is a prominent phenomenon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and is sensitive to the properties of the matter created in those collisions. It is often measured by two- and multi-particle correlations and is therefore contaminated by nonflow, those genuine few-body correlations unrelated to the global event-wise correlations. Many methods have been devised to estimate nonflow contamination with various degrees of successes and difficulties. Here, we review those methods pedagogically, discussing the pros and cons of each method, and give examples of ballpark estimate of nonflow contamination and associated uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We hope such a review of the various nonflow estimation methods in a single place would prove helpful to future researches.</description>

      <title>The Proton Charge Radius from Dimuon Photoproduction off the Proton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of measuring the proton charge radius through dimuon photoproduction off a proton target. Our findings indicate that the Bethe-Heitler mechanism, which dominates at small momentum transfers, allows for an extraction of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the extremely low $Q^2$ region below $10^{-3}$ GeV$^2$ in the spacelike region, when the incident photon beam energy exceeds several hundred MeV. The optimal kinematical region and a sensitivity study of the proton charge radius from dimuon photoproduction are presented. Such a measurement is expected to provide an alternative to the elastic muon-proton scattering measurements such as MUSE at PSI and AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of the heavy quark in the domain of the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drag and diffusion coefficients of the Heavy Quarks (HQs), such as charm and bottom, are one of the prime tools for discerning the properties of the deconfined QCD medium created in the Heavy Ion Collisions experiments. The innate non-perturbative nature of the QCD medium renders it imperative to estimate the transport coefficients in that domain. The present work evaluates the drag and diffusion coefficients of the moving HQ interacting with the medium particles via two-body collisional and three-body radiative processes to the first order in opacity by employing Gribov mechanism for the non-perturbative regime. We proffer the latest results of the HQ transport coefficients computed for the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation off the HQ. The calculations show significant increment of the transport coefficients with the increasing non-eikonality by juxtaposing the results with those of the pertubative and eikonal regions. We hope to shed fresh light towards explaining the experimental data on the nuclear modification facor, $R_{AA}$, the elliptic flow, $v_2$ of the HQ by advocating the importance of the non-eikonality of the gluon radiation off the HQ.</description>

Abstract: We discuss how to extract numerically the expected lowest quasi-normal mode (QNM) associated with the pressure anisotropy for a Bjorken flux evolution to equilibrium. This QNM was easily decoded subtracting the hydrodynamical attractors and was compared with other authors calculations. After evolutions with transients close to the expected lowest QNM the system goes to a tail (pure imaginary frequency) for late times. We analyze the relevance of Navier-Stokes, second order and Borel attractors at each stage of the evolution, which begins far-from-equilibrium and ends close to equilibrium.</description>
