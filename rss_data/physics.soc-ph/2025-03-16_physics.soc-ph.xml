      <title>Switching exploration modes in human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in human mobility research have revealed consistent pairwise characteristics in movement behavior, yet existing mobility models often overlook the spatial and topological structure of mobility networks. By analyzing millions of devices' anonymized cell phone trajectories, we uncover a distinct modular organization within these networks, demonstrating that movements within spatial modules differ significantly from those between modules. This finding challenges the conventional assumption of uniform mobility dynamics and underscores the influence of heterogeneous environments on human movement. Inspired by switching behaviors in animal movement patterns, we introduce a novel "switch mechanism" to differentiate movement modes, allowing our model to accurately reproduce both the modular structures of trajectory networks and spatial mobility patterns. Our results provide new insights into the dynamics of human mobility and its impact on network formation, with broad applications in traffic prediction, disease transmission modeling, and urban planning. Beyond advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of mobility networks, this work opens new avenues for understanding societal dynamics at large.</description>

      <title>Demography-independent behavioural dynamics influenced the spread of COVID-19 in Denmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the factors that impact how a communicable disease like COVID-19 spreads is of central importance to mitigate future outbreaks. Traditionally, epidemic surveillance and forecasting analyses have focused on epidemiological data but recent advancements have demonstrated that monitoring behavioural changes may be equally important. Prior studies have shown that high-frequency survey data on social contact behaviour were able to improve predictions of epidemiological observables during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the full potential of such highly granular survey data remains debated. Here, we utilise daily nationally representative survey data from Denmark collected during 23 months of the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate two central use-cases for such high-frequency survey data. First, we show that complex behavioural patterns across demographics collapse to a small number of universal key features, greatly simplifying the monitoring and analysis of adherence to outbreak-mitigation measures. Notably, the temporal evolution of the self-reported median number of face-to-face contacts follows a universal behavioural pattern across age groups, with potential to simplify analysis efforts for future outbreaks. Second, we show that these key features can be leveraged to improve deep-learning-based predictions of daily reported new infections. In particular, our models detect a strong link between aggregated self-reported social distancing and hygiene behaviours and the number of new cases in the subsequent days. Taken together, our results highlight the value of high-frequency surveys to improve our understanding of population behaviour in an ongoing public health crisis and its potential use for prediction of central epidemiological observables.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Construction of Age-Structured Contact Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing the structure of a population and characterising contacts within the population are key to reliable projections of infectious disease. Two main elements of population structure -- contact heterogeneity and age -- have been repeatedly demonstrated to be key in infection dynamics, yet are rarely combined. Regarding individuals as nodes and contacts as edges within a network provides a powerful and intuitive method to fully realise this population structure. While there are a few key examples of contact networks being measured explicitly, in general we need to construct the appropriate networks from individual-level data. Here, using data from social contact surveys, we develop a generic and robust algorithm to generate an extrapolated network that preserves both age-structured mixing and heterogeneity in the number of contacts. We then use these networks to simulate the spread of infection through the population, constrained to have a given basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and hence a given early growth rate. Given the over-dominant role that highly connected nodes (`superspreaders') would otherwise play in early dynamics, we scale transmission by the average duration of contacts, providing a better match to surveillance data for numbers of secondary cases. This network-based model shows that, for COVID-like parameters, including both heterogeneity and age-structure reduces both peak height and epidemic size compared to models that ignore heterogeneity. Our robust methodology therefore allows for the inclusion of the full wealth of data commonly collected by surveys but frequently overlooked to be incorporated into more realistic transmission models of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Probability-turbulence divergence: A tunable allotaxonometric instrument for comparing heavy-tailed categorical distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems often comprise many distinct types of elements as well as many more types of networked interactions between elements. When the relative abundances of types can be measured well, we often observe heavy-tailed categorical distributions for type frequencies. For the comparison of type frequency distributions of two systems or a system with itself at different time points in time -- a facet of allotaxonometry -- a great range of probability divergences are available. Here, we introduce and explore `probability-turbulence divergence', a tunable, straightforward, and interpretable instrument for comparing normalizable categorical frequency distributions. We model probability-turbulence divergence (PTD) after rank-turbulence divergence (RTD). While probability-turbulence divergence is more limited in application than rank-turbulence divergence, it is more sensitive to changes in type frequency. We build allotaxonographs to display probability turbulence, incorporating a way to visually accommodate zero probabilities for `exclusive types' which are types that appear in only one system. We explore comparisons of example distributions taken from literature, social media, and ecology. We show how probability-turbulence divergence either explicitly or functionally generalizes many existing kinds of distances and measures, including, as special cases, $L^{(p)}$ norms, the S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient (the $F_{1}$ statistic), and the Hellinger distance. We discuss similarities with the generalized entropies of R{\'e}nyi and Tsallis, and the diversity indices (or Hill numbers) from ecology. We close with thoughts on open problems concerning the optimization of the tuning of rank- and probability-turbulence divergence.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Model Of Trust as a Predictor of Social Group Sizes and its Implications for Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human capacity for working together and with tools builds on cognitive abilities that, while not unique to humans, are most developed in humans both in scale and plasticity. Our capacity to engage with collaborators and with technology requires a continuous expenditure of attentive work that we show may be understood in terms of what is heuristically argued as`trust' in socio-economic fields. By adopting a `social physics' of information approach, we are able to bring dimensional analysis to bear on an anthropological-economic issue. The cognitive-economic trade-off between group size and rate of attention to detail is the connection between these. This allows humans to scale cooperative effort across groups, from teams to communities, with a trade-off between group size and attention. We show here that an accurate concept of trust follows a bipartite `economy of work' model, and that this leads to correct predictions about the statistical distribution of group sizes in society. Trust is essentially a cognitive-economic issue that depends on the memory cost of past behaviour and on the frequency of attentive policing of intent. All this leads to the characteristic `fractal' structure for human communities. The balance between attraction to some alpha attractor and dispersion due to conflict fully explains data from all relevant sources. The implications of our method suggest a broad applicability beyond purely social groupings to general resource constrained interactions, e.g. in work, technology, cybernetics, and generalized socio-economic systems of all kinds.</description>

      <title>Dilemmas and trade-offs in the diffusion of conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outside ideal settings, conventions are shaped by competing processes that can challenge the emergence of norms. This paper identifies three trade-offs challenging the diffusion of conventions: (I) the trade-off between the imperatives of social, sequential, and contextual consistency that individuals balance when choosing between conventions; (II) the competition between local and global coordination, depending on whether individuals coordinate their behavior via interactions throughout a social network or external factors transcending the network; and (III) the balance between decision optimality (e.g., collective satisfaction) and decision costs when collectives with conflicting preferences choose a convention. We develop a broadly applicable statistical physics framework for measuring each of these trade-offs, which we then apply to a sign convention in physics. Our method can recover the structure of the underlying coordination game, the networks of social interactions involved, and the processes through which conflicts are resolved in collaborations. We find that the purpose of conventions may exceed coordination, and that individual preferences towards conventions are concurrently shaped by cultural factors and multiple social networks. Additionally, we reveal the role of leadership in the resolution of conflicts. Finally, this work provides a generalization of Lewis' account of conventions.</description>
