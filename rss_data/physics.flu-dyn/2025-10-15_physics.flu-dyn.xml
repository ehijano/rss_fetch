      <title>Is the transition to unsteadiness in the wake of slender bodies an artefact of boundary conditions ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the transition to unsteadiness in the wake of 2D slender bodies, and questions the relevance of the generally accepted scenario involving a region of absolute instability within the near wake. The case of a thin plate at zero incidence is first considered. Despite the absence of absolute instability region, global stability analysis reveals the existence of numerous unstable eigenvalues organized along a characteristic "arc-branch" whose properties significantly depends upon the size of the numerical domain. These arc-branch modes are explained as resulting from a non-local pressure perturbation spuriously generated at the outlet of the domain due to the no-stress boundary condition, which then triggers the shedding of vortical structures at the trailing edge of the plate. The case of NACA0012 wing profiles at small incidences is then considered. Global stability analysis reveals that both the non-local spurious feedback mechanism and the classical local feedback mechanism are active. Trying to suppress the spurious feedback by enlarging the size of the numerical domain is shown to be inefficient. On the other hand, filtering methods suppressing the exponential spatial growth of perturbations, with either a sponge or a complex mapping, are found to be efficient. Thanks to these ideas, the critical Reynolds number and Strouhal number at onset can eventually be computed and are mapped for incidences in the range $ \alpha \in [0^o - 5 ^o]$. It is postulated that the non-local feedback mechanism evidenced here could be at play in other strongly convective flows.</description>

      <title>Model of deep zonal flows in giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism by which the surface zonal flows of giant planets can be gradually attenuated with depth is explored. The zonal flow is driven by an imposed forcing in a thin layer near the surface. A meridional circulation is set up, analogous to the Ferrel-like cells observed in Jupiter's atmosphere. Acting on a stably stratified thin surface layer, the meridional flow induces a horizontal temperature anomaly which leads to a gradual reduction of the zonal winds with depth, governed by the thermal wind equation. Our model is a Boussinesq plane layer, with gravity acting parallel to the rotation axis. A suite of fully three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations has been performed to investigate the model behaviour. Below the forced stable layer, convection is occurring, typically in the form of tall thin cells. The fluctuating components of the three-dimensional flow can be driven by either the convection or the Reynolds stresses associated with the jet shear flow. When fluctuations are mainly driven by convection in the form of tall thin columns and the forcing is relatively weak, the horizontal temperature anomaly persists much deeper into the interior than when it is driven by shear flow. The zonal jets can therefore extend deep into the interior, consistent with the Juno gravity data.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Ratchet for Tracer Transport in a Soft Microchannel: A Detailed Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding surface-driven transport is of paramount importance from the perspective of biological applications and the synthesis of microfluidic devices. In this work, we develop an analysis of a local inversion symmetry broken fluid flow model through an undulating microchannel. Surface undulations of a few tens of Hertz in a soft microchannel keep the fluid flow in a low Reynolds number regime, allowing the advantage of a perturbation analysis of fluid flow. Using this, we develop a detailed analysis of the relationship between the fluid velocity and surface undulations, which is crucial for the subsequent numerical analysis of tracer motion. We used this information to study the dynamics of a tracer particle in the velocity field of an undulating microchannel. We show that the tracer particle can undergo ratcheting (which we call the hydrodynamics ratchet effect) in very specific, physically meaningful circumstances. We observe a ratcheting velocity of $\sim 0.15 \;\mu$m/sec for a micrometre-sized particle at room temperature in water when the undulations wavelength is of the order of 1 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Migration and spreading of a droplet driven by a chemical step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical step is an elementary pattern in chemically heterogeneous substrates, featuring two regions of different wettability separated by a sharp border. Within the framework of lubrication theory, we investigate droplet motion and the contact-line dynamics driven by a chemical step, with the contact-line singularity addressed by the Navier slip condition. For both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) droplets, two successive stages are identified: the migration stage, when the droplet traverses both regions, and the asymmetric spreading stage, when the droplet spreads on the hydrophilic region while being constrained by the border. For 2D droplets, we present a matched asymptotic analysis which agrees with numerical solutions. In the migration stage, a 2D droplet can exhibit translational motion with a constant speed. In the asymmetric spreading stage, the contact line at the droplet rear is pinned at the border. We show that a boundary layer still exists near the pinned contact line, across which the slope is approximately constant, whereas the curvature would diverge in the absence of slip. For 3D droplets, our numerical simulations show that the evolution is qualitatively analogous to the 2D case, while being significantly affected by the lateral flow. At early times, the contact line on the hydrophilic region advances linearly and spreads transversely according to a power law $t^{1/2}$. The droplet length and width exhibit non-monotonic variations due to the lateral flow. Eventually, the droplet detaches from the border and reaches equilibrium at the hydrophilic substrate.</description>

      <title>Low Reynolds number flow in a packed bed of rotated bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study focuses on the gas flow through an experiment-scale modular packed bed reactor consisting of square bars, arranged in layers. Each layer is rotated by $30^\circ$ resulting in a complex shape of the void spaces between the bars. Particle Image Velocimetry measurement results inside and on top of the studied system are presented for particle-based Reynolds numbers of 100 and 200, and used as validation data for two sets of particle-resolved numerical simulations, using boundary conforming meshing strategy and treating the solid boundaries via the blocked-off method. The flow inside the bed is largely independent from the Reynolds number and seems to be determined by the geometry of the void spaces. The flow in the freeboard is dominated by the presence of slowly dissipating jets downstream of the bed, which are characterized by unsteady oscillations at the higher Reynolds number. The numerical results obtained with both methods are in good agreement with the measurements, both inside and above the bed. However, stronger deviations between the results can be observed in the freeboard and can be traced to numerical properties of the current simulation approaches.</description>

      <title>Origin of pressure-flow non-linearity in two-phase intermittent flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a first-principles model to predict the two-phase pressure drop in gas-liquid intermittent flow through round capillaries, which serve as the simplest analogous of a porous medium. Building upon the classical capillary flow theory, we derive a model for a train of elongated bubbles, and rigorously quantify its validity in terms of the dimensionless parameters of the problem (capillary number, number of bubbles, gas volume fraction, and channel length-to-diameter ratio). The total two-phase pressure drop is found to be non-linear with respect to the mean liquid slug velocity, varying in discrete steps due to its explicit dependence on the number of bubbles, and also influenced by the motion of both phases. Moreover, formulating the model in dimensionless terms reveals key scaling laws that govern the two-phase flow rheology. Perturbation theory shows that a single bubble induces an excess pressure drop in a liquid-filled slender channel, enabling the introduction of a pressure-dependent effective viscosity to describe the system. Finally, our analytical framework is extended from a single capillary to a bundle of cylindrical tubes. In nearly homogeneous bundles, inviscid bubble trains exhibit a smooth transition from a Bretherton-like regime with an apparent flow exponent of 2/3 at low pressure drops to weaker sub-linear regimes (with exponents between 2/3 and 1) as the pressure drop increases. Introducing the smallest pores disrupts the monotonic scaling of the flow exponent, reflecting a more complex rheological response. Deviations in two-phase flow behavior from the Darcy law are examined across the model parameter space and in relation to geometrical heterogeneity, offering new insights into pore-scale multiphase transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent advances in the numerical modeling of turbulent flows and star formation. An overview of the most widely used simulation codes and their core capabilities is provided. We then examine methods for achieving the highest-resolution magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations to date, highlighting challenges related to numerical viscosity and resistivity. State-of-the-art approaches to modeling gravity and star formation are discussed in detail, including implementations of star particles and feedback from jets, winds, heating, ionization, and supernovae. We review the latest techniques for radiation hydrodynamics, including ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and moment methods, with comparisons between the flux-limited diffusion, moment-1, and variable Eddington tensor methods. The final chapter summarizes advances in cosmic-ray transport schemes, emphasizing their growing importance for connecting small-scale star formation physics with galaxy-scale evolution.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian filtering for wave-mean flow decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geophysical flows are typically composed of wave and mean motions with a wide range of overlapping temporal scales, making separation between the two types of motion in wave-resolving numerical simulations challenging. Lagrangian filtering - whereby a temporal filter is applied in the frame of the flow - is an effective way to overcome this challenge, allowing clean separation of waves from mean flow based on frequency separation in a Lagrangian frame. Previous implementations of Lagrangian filtering have used particle tracking approaches, which are subject to large memory requirements or difficulties with particle clustering. Kafiabad and Vanneste (2023, KV23) recently proposed a novel method for finding Lagrangian means without particle tracking by solving a set of partial differential equations alongside the governing equations of the flow. In this work, we adapt the approach of KV23 to develop a flexible, on-the-fly, PDE-based method for Lagrangian filtering using arbitrary convolutional filters. We present several different wave-mean decompositions, demonstrating that our Lagrangian methods are capable of recovering a clean wave-field from a nonlinear simulation of geostrophic turbulence interacting with Poincar\'e waves.</description>

      <title>Techniques for improved statistical convergence in quantification of eddy diffusivity moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent approaches, such as the macroscopic forcing method (MFM) or Green's function-based approaches, can be used to compute Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes closure operators using forced direct numerical simulations, MFM can also be used to directly compute moments of the effective nonlocal and anisotropic eddy diffusivities. The low-order spatial and temporal moments contain limited information about the eddy diffusivity but are often sufficient for quantification and modeling of nonlocal and anisotropic effects. However, when using MFM to compute eddy diffusivity moments, the statistical convergence can be slow for higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that using the same direct numerical simulation (DNS) for all forced MFM simulations improves statistical convergence of the eddy diffusivity moments. We present its implementation in conjunction with a decomposition method that handles the MFM forcing semi-analytically and allows for consistent boundary condition treatment, which we develop for both scalar and momentum transport. We demonstrate that for a two-dimensional Rayleigh--Taylor instability case study, using the same DNS for all forced MFM simulations results in convergence with O(100) simulations rather than O(1000) simulations. We then demonstrate the impacts of improved convergence on the quantification of the eddy diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Machine Learning Closures and Wall Models for Hypersonic Transition-Continuum Boundary Layer Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling rarefied hypersonic flows remains a fundamental challenge due to the breakdown of classical continuum assumptions in the transition-continuum regime, where the Knudsen number ranges from approximately 0.1 to 10. Conventional Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) models with empirical slip-wall boundary conditions fail to accurately predict nonequilibrium effects such as velocity slip, temperature jump, and shock structure deviations. We develop a physics-constrained machine learning framework that augments transport models and boundary conditions to extend the applicability of continuum solvers in nonequilibrium hypersonic regimes. We employ deep learning PDE models (DPMs) for the viscous stress and heat flux embedded in the governing PDEs and trained via adjoint-based optimization. We evaluate these for two-dimensional supersonic flat-plate flows across a range of Mach and Knudsen numbers. Additionally, we introduce a wall model based on a mixture of skewed Gaussian approximations of the particle velocity distribution function. This wall model replaces empirical slip conditions with physically informed, data-driven boundary conditions for the streamwise velocity and wall temperature. Our results show that a trace-free anisotropic viscosity model, paired with the skewed-Gaussian distribution function wall model, achieves significantly improved accuracy, particularly at high-Mach and high-Knudsen number regimes. Strategies such as parallel training across multiple Knudsen numbers and inclusion of high-Mach data during training are shown to enhance model generalization. Increasing model complexity yields diminishing returns for out-of-sample cases, underscoring the need to balance degrees of freedom and overfitting. This work establishes data-driven, physics-consistent strategies for improving hypersonic flow modeling for regimes in which conventional continuum approaches are invalid.</description>

      <title>Improving the robustness of the immersed interface method through regularized velocity reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust, broadly applicable fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithms remain a challenge for computational mechanics. In previous work, we introduced an immersed interface method (IIM) for discrete surfaces and an extension based on an immersed Lagrangia-Eulerian (ILE) coupling strategy for modeling FSI involving complex geometries. The ability of the method to sharply resolve stress discontinuities induced by singular immersed boundary forces in the presence of low-regularity geometrical representations makes it a compelling choice for three-dimensional modeling of complex geometries in diverse engineering applications. Although the IIM we previously introduced offers many desirable advantages, it also imposes a restrictive mesh factor ratio, requiring the surface mesh to be coarser than the fluid grid to ensure stability. This is because when the mesh factor ratio constraint is not satisfied, parts of the structure motion are not controlled by the discrete FSI system. This constraint can significantly increase computational costs, particularly in applications involving multiscale geometries with highly localized complexity or fine-scale features. To address this limitation, we devise a stabilization strategy for the velocity restriction operator inspired by Tikhonov regularization. This study demonstrates that using a stabilized velocity restriction operator in IIM enables a broader range of structure-to-fluid grid-size ratios without compromising accuracy or altering the flow dynamics. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of the method to real-world FSI problems involving complex geometries and dynamic conditions, offering a robust and practical solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interactions are commonly modeled using no-slip boundary conditions. However, small deviations from these conditions can significantly alter the dynamics of suspensions and particles, especially at the micro and nano scales. This work presents a robust implicit solvent method for simulating non-colloidal suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions. Our approach is based on a regularized boundary integral formulation, enabling accurate and efficient computation of hydrodynamic interactions. This makes the method well-suited for large-scale simulations. We validate the method by comparing computed drag forces on homogeneous and Janus particles with analytical results. Additionally, we consider the effective viscosity of suspensions with varying slip lengths, benchmarking against available analytical no-slip and partial-slip theories.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium evaporation of Lennard-Jones fluids: Enskog-Vlasov theory and Hertz-Knudsen model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enskog-Vlasov equation is currently the most sophisticated kinetic model for describing non-equilibrium evaporative flows. While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by both the assumptions underlying the Vlasov forcing term and the approximation introduced by the Enskog collision term for short-range molecular interactions. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, transport coefficients, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The results confirm that deviations from the Maxwellian distribution persist in the vapour region, indicating limitations of the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation under pronounced non-equilibrium conditions. This work represents a critical step towards the development of an accurate and efficient computational framework for modelling non-equilibrium liquid-vapour flows for real fluids, with direct relevance to practical applications such as flow cooling.</description>
