      <title>Forecasting Binary Economic Events in Modern Mercantilism: Traditional methodologies coupled with PCA and K-means Quantitative Analysis of Qualitative Sentimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines Modern Mercantilism, characterized by rising economic nationalism, strategic technological decoupling, and geopolitical fragmentation, as a disruptive shift from the post-1945 globalization paradigm. It applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to 768-dimensional SBERT-generated semantic embeddings of curated news articles to extract orthogonal latent factors that discriminate binary event outcomes linked to protectionism, technological sovereignty, and bloc realignments. Analysis of principal component loadings identifies key semantic features driving classification performance, enhancing interpretability and predictive accuracy. This methodology provides a scalable, data-driven framework for quantitatively tracking emergent mercantilist dynamics through high-dimensional text analytics</description>

      <title>The Market Effects of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there is excitement about the potential for algorithms to optimize individual decision-making, changes in individual behavior will, almost inevitably, impact markets. Yet little is known about such effects. In this paper, I study how the availability of algorithmic prediction changes entry, allocation, and prices in the US single-family housing market, a key driver of household wealth. I identify a market-level natural experiment that generates variation in the cost of using algorithms to value houses: digitization, the transition from physical to digital housing records. I show that digitization leads to entry by investors using algorithms, but does not push out investors using human judgment. Instead, human investors shift toward houses that are difficult to predict algorithmically. Algorithmic investors predominantly purchase minority-owned homes, a segment of the market where humans may be biased. Digitization increases the average sale price of minority-owned homes by 5% and reduces racial disparities in home prices by 45%. Algorithmic investors, via competition, affect the prices paid by owner-occupiers and human investors for minority homes; such changes drive the majority of the reduction in racial disparities. The decrease in racial inequality underscores the potential for algorithms to mitigate human biases at the market level.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Domain AI Readiness, and Firm Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise for enhancing innovation and productivity, many firms struggle to realize its benefits. We investigate why some firms and industries succeed with AI while others do not, focusing on the degree to which an industrial domain is technologically integrated with AI, which we term "domain AI readiness". Using panel data on Chinese listed firms from 2016 to 2022, we examine how the interaction between firm-level AI capabilities and domain AI readiness affects firm performance. We create novel constructs from patent data and measure the domain AI readiness of a specific domain by analyzing the co-occurrence of four-digit International Patent Classification (IPC4) codes related to AI with the specific domain across all patents in that domain. Our findings reveal a strong complementarity: AI capabilities yield greater productivity and innovation gains when deployed in domains with higher AI readiness, whereas benefits are limited in domains that are technologically unprepared or already obsolete. These results remain robust when using local AI policy initiatives as instrumental variables. Further analysis shows that this complementarity is driven by external advances in domain-AI integration, rather than firms' own strategic pivots. Time-series analysis of IPC4 co-occurrence patterns further suggests that improvements in domain AI readiness stem primarily from the academic advancements of AI in specific domains.</description>

      <title>A Characterization Framework for Stable Sets and Their Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of optimal choice sets offers a well-established solution framework in social choice and game theory. In social choice theory, decision-making is typically modeled as a maximization problem. However, when preferences are cyclic -- as can occur in economic processes -- the set of maximal elements may be empty, raising the key question of what should be considered a valid choice. To address this issue, several approaches -- collectively known as general solution theories -- have been proposed for constructing non-empty choice sets. Among the most prominent in the context of a finite set of alternatives are the Stable Set (also known as the Von Neumann-Morgenstern set) and its extensions, such as the Extended Stable Set, the socially stable set, and the $m$-, and $w$-stable sets. In this paper, we extend the classical concept of the stable set and its major variants - specifically, the extended stable set, the socially stable set, and the $m$- and $w$-stable sets - within the framework of irreflexive binary relations over infinite sets of alternatives. Additionally, we provide a topological characterization for the existence of such general solutions.</description>

      <title>How Exposed Are UK Jobs to Generative AI? Developing and Applying a Novel Task-Based Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We draw on Eloundou et al. (2024) to develop the Generative AI Susceptibility Index (GAISI), a task-based measure of UK job exposure to large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. GAISI is derived from probabilistic task ratings by LLMs and linked to worker-reported task data from the Skills and Employment Surveys. It reflects the share of job activities where an LLM or LLM-powered system can reduce task completion time by at least 25% beyond existing productivity tools. The index demonstrates high reliability, strong alignment with AI capabilities, and superior predictive power compared to existing exposure measures. By 2023-24, nearly all UK jobs exhibited some exposure, yet only a minority were heavily affected. Aggregate exposure has risen since 2017, primarily due to occupational shifts rather than changes in task profiles. The price premium for AI-exposed tasks declined relative to 2017, measuring approximately 12% lower in 2023-24. Job postings fell following the release of ChatGPT, with job postings 5.5% lower in 2025-Q2 than if pre-GPT hiring patterns had persisted. GAISI offers a robust framework for assessing AI's impact on work, providing early evidence that displacement effects may already outweigh productivity gains.</description>

      <title>Intergenerational Equitable Climate Change Mitigation: Negative Effects of Stochastic Interest Rates; Positive Effects of Financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate mitigation decisions today affect future generations, raising questions of intergenerational equity. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) rely on discounting to evaluate long-term policy costs and benefits. Using the DICE model, we quantify how optimal pathways distribute abatement and damage costs across cohorts. Unconstrained optimization creates intergenerational inequality, with future generations bearing higher costs relative to GDP. Extending the model with stochastic discount rates, we show that discount-rate uncertainty significantly amplifies this inequality. We consider two independent extensions: the financing of abatement costs and the modeling of nonlinear financing costs under large damages. Both extensions can materially improve intergenerational equity by distributing mitigation efforts more evenly. As an illustration, we present a modified DICE model whose optimal pathway limits generational costs to 3 % of GDP, leading to more equitable effort sharing. Our proposed model extensions are model-agnostic, applicable across IAMs, and compatible with alternative intergenerational equity metrics.</description>

      <title>ABIDES-Economist: Agent-Based Simulator of Economic Systems with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ABIDES-Economist, an agent-based simulator for economic systems that includes heterogeneous households, firms, a central bank, and a government. Agent behavior can be defined using domain-specific behavioral rules or learned through reinforcement learning by specifying their objectives. We integrate reinforcement learning capabilities for all agents using the OpenAI Gym environment framework for the multi-agent system. To enhance the realism of our model, we base agent parameters and action spaces on economic literature and real U.S. economic data. To tackle the challenges of calibrating heterogeneous agent-based economic models, we conduct a comprehensive survey of stylized facts related to both microeconomic and macroeconomic time series data. We then validate ABIDES-Economist by demonstrating its ability to generate simulated data that aligns with the relevant stylized facts for the economic scenario under consideration, following the learning of all agent behaviors via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we train our economic agents' policies under two broad configurations. The first configuration demonstrates that the learned economic agents produce system data consistent with macroeconomic and microeconomic stylized facts. The second configuration illustrates the utility of the validated simulation platform in designing regulatory policies for the central bank and government. These policies outperform standard rule-based approaches from the literature, which often overlook agent heterogeneity, shocks, and agent adaptability.</description>
