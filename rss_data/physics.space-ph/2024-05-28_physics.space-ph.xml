      <title>Identification of coupled Landau and anomalous resonances in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-particle resonance, a ubiquitous process in the plasma universe, occurs when resonant particles observe a constant wave phase to enable sustained energy transfer. Here, we present spacecraft observations of simultaneous Landau and anomalous resonances between oblique whistler waves and the same group of protons, which are evidenced, respectively, by phase-space rings in parallel-velocity spectra and phase-bunched distributions in gyro-phase spectra. Our results indicate the coupling between Landau and anomalous resonances via the overlapping of the resonance islands.</description>

      <title>Near subsonic solar wind outflow from an active region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During Parker Solar Probe (Parker) Encounter 15 (E15), we observe an 18-hour period of near subsonic ($\mathrm{M_S \sim}$ 1) and sub-Alfv\'enic (SA), $\mathrm{M_A}$ &lt;&lt;&lt; 1, slow speed solar wind from 22 to 15.6 R$_\odot$. As the most extreme SA interval measured to date and skirting the solar wind sonic point, it is the deepest Parker has probed into the formation and acceleration region of the solar wind in the corona. The stream is also measured by Wind and MMS near 1AU at times consistent with ballistic propagation of this slow stream. We investigate the stream source, properties and potential coronal heating consequences via combining these observations with coronal modeling and turbulence analysis. Through source mapping, in situ evidence and multi-point arrival time considerations of a candidate CME, we determine the stream is a steady (non-transient), long-lived and approximately Parker spiral aligned and arises from overexpanded field lines mapping back to an active region. Turbulence analysis of the Els\"{a}sser variables shows the inertial range scaling of the $\mathrm{\mathbf{z}^{+}}$ mode ($\mathrm{f \sim ^{-3/2}}$) to be dominated by the slab component. We discuss the spectral flattening and difficulties associated with measuring the $\mathrm{\mathbf{z}^{-}}$ spectra, cautioning against making definitive conclusions from the $\mathrm{\mathbf{z}^{-}}$ mode. Despite being more extreme than prior sub-Alfv\'enic intervals, its turbulent nature does not appear to be qualitatively different from previously observed streams. We conclude that this extreme low dynamic pressure solar wind interval (which has the potential for extreme space weather conditions) is a large, steady structure spanning at least to 1AU.</description>

      <title>3-Minute Oscillations in the Upper Corona: Evidence from Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) from around the Alfv\'en surface have shown that the trace magnetic power spectrum density (PSD) is often characterized by a shallow-inertial double power law, where in the low frequency energy injection range, the power spectrum is shallow (flatter than $1/f$), and in the inertial range the spectrum is steep, with a scaling index of [1.5, 1.67]. Consequently, close to the sun, the majority of the fluctuation energy concentrates in a small frequency range around the low frequency power spectral break. In this work, we conduct a systematic survey of PSP observations for the first 17 encounters to statistically study the energy behaviors of the magnetic fluctuations. Our results show that the center frequency of fluctuation energy systematically drifts to around 3-minute for the most pristine solar wind (smallest solar wind advection time). Moreover, the center frequency rapidly drifts to lower frequency as solar wind advection time increases, as expected for active turbulence. The concentration of fluctuation energy around 3-minutes suggests that Alfv\'enic fluctuations in solar wind might mostly be coming from resonant p-mode oscillations in the photosphere, though other potential sources are discussed.</description>

      <title>Parker Solar Probe Observations of Energetic Particles in the Flank of a Coronal Mass Ejection Close to the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16590</link>

Abstract: We present an event observed by Parker Solar Probe at $\sim$0.2 au on March 2, 2022 in which imaging and \emph{in situ} measurements coincide. During this event, PSP passed through structures on the flank of a streamer blowout CME including an isolated flux tube in front of the CME, a turbulent sheath, and the CME itself. Imaging observations and \emph{in situ} helicity and principal variance signatures consistently show the presence of flux ropes internal to the CME. In both the sheath, and the CME interval, the distributions are more isotropic, the spectra are softer, and the abundance ratios of Fe/O and He/H are lower than those in the isolated flux tube, and yet elevated relative to typical plasma and SEP abundances. These signatures in the sheath and the CME indicate that both flare populations and those from the plasma are accelerated to form the observed energetic particle enhancements. In contrast, the isolated flux tube shows large streaming, hard spectra and large Fe/O and He/H ratios, indicating flare sources. Energetic particle fluxes are most enhanced within the CME interval from suprathermal through energetic particle energies ($\sim$ keV to $&gt;10$ MeV), indicating particle acceleration, and confinement local to the closed magnetic structure. The flux-rope morphology of the CME helps to enable local modulation and trapping of energetic particles, particularly along helicity channels and other plasma boundaries. Thus, the CME acts to build-up energetic particle populations, allowing them to be fed into subsequent higher energy particle acceleration throughout the inner heliosphere where a compression or shock forms on the CME front.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy predictions from GREA: Background and linear perturbation theory</title>

Abstract: General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory provides a covariant formalism for out-of-equilibrium phenomena in GR, extending the Einstein equations with an entropic force that behaves like bulk viscosity with a negative effective pressure. In particular, the growth of entropy associated with the homogeneous causal horizon can explain the present acceleration of the Universe, without introducing a cosmological constant. The dynamics of the accelerated Universe is characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$, the ratio of the causal horizon to the curvature scale, which provides a unique history of the Universe distinguishable from that of LCDM. In particular, we explain the coincidence problem and the Hubble tension by shifting the coasting point to higher redshifts. All background observables are correlated among themselves due to their common dependence on $\alpha$. This scenario gives a specific evolution for the effective equation of state parameter, $w(a)$. Furthermore, we study the linear growth of matter perturbations in the context of a homogeneous expanding background driven by the entropy of the causal horizon. We find that the rate of growth of matter fluctuations in GREA slows down due to the accelerated expansion and alleviates the $\sigma_8$ tension of LCDM. We compute the growth function of matter fluctuations, the redshift space distortions in the galaxy correlation function, as well as the redshift evolution of the BAO scale, and find that the ISW effect is significantly larger than in LCDM. It is interesting to note that many of the tensions and anomalies of the standard model of cosmology are alleviated by the inclusion of this transient period of acceleration of the Universe based on known fundamental physics. In the near future we will be able to constrain this theory with present data from deep galaxy surveys.</description>
