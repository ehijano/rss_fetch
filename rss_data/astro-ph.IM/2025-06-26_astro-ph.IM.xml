      <title>A Bayesian approach to modelling spectrometer data chromaticity corrected using beam factors -- II. Model priors and posterior odds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable detection of the global 21-cm signal, a key tracer of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, requires meticulous data modelling and robust statistical frameworks for model validation and comparison. In Paper I of this series, we presented the Beam-Factor-based Chromaticity Correction (BFCC) model for spectrometer data processed using BFCC to suppress instrumentally induced spectral structure. We demonstrated that the BFCC model, with complexity calibrated by Bayes factor-based model comparison (BFBMC), enables unbiased recovery of a 21-cm signal consistent with the one reported by EDGES from simulated data. Here, we extend the evaluation of the BFCC model to lower amplitude 21-cm signal scenarios where deriving reliable conclusions about a model's capacity to recover unbiased 21-cm signal estimates using BFBMC is more challenging. Using realistic simulations of chromaticity-corrected EDGES-low spectrometer data, we evaluate three signal amplitude regimes -- null, moderate, and high. We then conduct a Bayesian comparison between the BFCC model and three alternative models previously applied to 21-cm signal estimation from EDGES data. To mitigate biases introduced by systematics in the 21-cm signal model fit, we incorporate the Bayesian Null-Test-Evidence-Ratio (BaNTER) validation framework and implement a Bayesian inference workflow based on posterior odds of the validated models. We demonstrate that, unlike BFBMC alone, this approach consistently recovers 21-cm signal estimates that align with the true signal across all amplitude regimes, advancing robust global 21-cm signal detection methodologies.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10x10 pixel map of a 1 R_Earth world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per "micro-pixel". We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based extremely large telescopes with extreme adaptive optics; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals - exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization - each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the astrometric resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits - but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens - providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once a spacecraft reaches &gt;=550 AU - remains the only near-term, scientifically and technologically viable means to acquire true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>In-flight calibration of the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), as a pathfinder of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, is the first lobster-eye focusing X-ray telescope with a considerably large field-of-view (FoV) ever flown. During the two and half years of operations, a series of calibration observations were performed, to fully characterize its performance and calibrate the instrumental properties. In this paper, we present the results of the in-flight calibration campaign of LEIA, focusing on the properties of the PSF, source positional accuracy, effective area, energy response and the instrumental background. The calibration sources used are the Crab nebula, Sco X-1 and Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Specifically, it is found that the spatial resolution remains almost unchanged compared to the pre-launch values, ranging from 3.6'-9.3' with a median of 5.9'. The post-calibration source positional accuracy is found to be ~2' (at the 90% C.L.). The Crab spectra can be well reproduced by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit parameters in large agreement with the literature values, indicating that the in-orbit effective area is overall consistent with the model predictions and ground measurements. The effective area exhibits a systematic of $\lesssim10\%$ (at the 68% C.L.), and a mild deterioration of ~15% at the lower energy end after one year of operation. The Cas A spectral analysis shows that the energy scale and spectral resolution of the detectors are generally consistent with ground values. The instrumental background is found to be largely consistent among the four detectors, with strong modulations by the geomagnetic activity and the spectrum qualitatively consistent with our previous simulations. These instrumental performances well meet the design requirements. This work paves the way for the in-orbit calibration of the EP-WXT.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Non-Gaussian Instrumental Noise in Perturbed Nulling Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the astrophysics community working towards the first observations and characterizations of Earth-like exoplanets, interest in space-based nulling interferometry has been renewed. This technique promises unique scientific and technical advantages by enabling direct mid-infrared observations. However, concept studies of nulling interferometers often overlook the impact of systematic noise caused by instrument perturbations. Earlier research introduced analytical and numerical models to address instrumental noise and, building on these results, we reproduce key simulations and report that the noise in the differential output of nulling interferometers follows a non-Gaussian distribution. The presence of non-Gaussian noise challenges the validity of classical hypothesis tests in detection performance estimates, as their reliance on Gaussian assumptions leads to overconfidence in detection thresholds. For the first time, we derive the true noise distribution of the differential output of a dual Bracewell nulling interferometer, demonstrating that it follows iterative convolutions of Bessel functions. Understanding this noise distribution enables a refined formulation of hypothesis testing in nulling interferometry, leading to a semi-analytical prediction of detection performance. This computationally efficient instrument model, implemented in a publicly available codebase, is designed for integration into science yield predictions for nulling interferometry mission concepts. It will play a key role in refining key mission parameters for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE).</description>

      <title>Hundreds of TESS exoplanets might be larger than we thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radius of a planet is a fundamental parameter that probes its composition and habitability. Precise radius measurements are typically derived from the fraction of starlight blocked when a planet transits its host star. The wide-field Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered hundreds of new exoplanets, but its low angular resolution means that the light from a star hosting a transiting exoplanet can be blended with the light from background stars. If not fully corrected, this extra light can dilute the transit signal and result in a smaller measured planet radius. In a study of hundreds of TESS planet discoveries using deblended light curves from our validated methodology, we show that systematically incorrect planet radii are common in the literature: studies using various public TESS photometry pipelines have underestimated the planet radius by a weighted median of $6.1\% \pm 0.3\%$, leading to a $\sim20\%$ overestimation of planet density. The widespread presence of these biases in the literature has profoundly shaped-and potentially misrepresented-our understanding of the exoplanet population. Addressing these biases will refine the exoplanet mass-radius relation, reshape our understanding of exoplanet atmospheric and bulk composition, and potentially inform prevailing planet formation theories.</description>

      <title>Waging a Campaign: Results from an Injection-Recovery Study involving 35 numerical Relativity Simulations and three Waveform Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Bayesian inference results from an extensive injection-recovery campaign to test the validity of three state of the art quasicircular gravitational waveform models: \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM}, the latter with the \textsc{SpinTaylorT4} implementation for its precession dynamics. We analyze 35 strongly precessing binary black hole numerical relativity simulations with all available harmonic content. Ten simulations have a mass ratio of $4:1$ and five, mass ratio of $8:1$. Overall, we find that \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM} is the most consistent model to numerical relativity, with the majority of true source properties lying within the inferred 90\% credible interval. However, we find that none of the models can reliably infer the true source properties for binaries with mass ratio $8:1$ systems. We additionally conduct inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) consistency tests to determine if our chosen state of the art waveform models infer consistent properties when analysing only the inspiral (low frequency) and ringdown (high frequency) portions of the signal. For the simulations considered in this work, we find that the IMR consistency test depends on the frequency that separates the inspiral and ringdown regimes. For two sensible choices of the cutoff frequency, we report that \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM} can produce false GR deviations. Meanwhile, we find that \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM} is the most reliable model under the IMR consistency test. Finally, we re-analyze the same 35 simulations, but this time we incorporate model accuracy into our Bayesian inference. Consistent with the work in Hoy et al. 2024 [arXiv: 2409.19404], we find this approach generally yields more accurate inferred properties for binary black holes with less biases compared to methods that combine model-dependent posterior distributions based on their evidence, or with equal weight.</description>

      <title>Development of an Open-Source Spacecraft Bus for the PULSE-A CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The undergraduate-led Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) at the University of Chicago seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of circular polarization shift keyed satellite-to-ground laser communication. PULSE-A's low-cost open-source bus serves as the backbone of the mission and has been designed in tandem with the Payload, with design driven by strict requirements for pointing accuracy, component alignment, power demand, and thermal stability. This work presents the design and testing of the PULSE-A bus.
  The spacecraft bus was designed to fill two major needs: (1) to meet the requirements of the PULSE-A mission, and (2) to be easily configurable for future missions that desire enhanced capabilities over other low-cost open-source designs. At its core, the bus features dual BeagleBone Black Industrial compute units, selected for their flight heritage, integrated via a PC/104 header standard. PULSE-A implements Goddard Space Flight Center's core Flight System (cFS), which takes a modular software architecture approach and is built in C. The use of C as the primary language aligns with the expertise of the University of Chicago's Computer Science department, allowing for ease of development by PULSE-A's undergraduate flight software team.
  The CubeSat structure utilizes Gran Systems' 3U frame, modified to accommodate openings for various ports and deployable components. Inside, the avionics stack uses the PC/104 standard quad rails, which terminate in PULSE-A's custom-designed Payload Box that houses all of the Payload components and optical fiber runs. This work also covers the techniques and iterative engineering processes used to develop the thermal control and dissipation mechanisms for the specific requirements, under volume, mass, and temperature-range constraints.</description>

      <title>Empirically Predicted Absolute Magnitudes for Red Clump Stars in Mephisto and CSST Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red clump (RC) stars are reliable standard candles for studying the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. In this study, we present empirical calibrations of RC absolute magnitudes in the Mephisto (v, g, r, i) and CSST (g, r, i) photometric systems using a high-purity sample of 25,059 RC stars cross-matched between APOGEE and Gaia DR3 XP spectra. Through synthetic photometry and polynomial fitting, we find that RC absolute magnitudes exhibit strong dependencies on effective temperature and metallicity, with the strongest variations observed in bluer bands and progressively decreasing towards redder wavelengths. In particular, the Mephisto v band exhibits the highest sensitivity, with variations reaching up to 2.0 mag across the metallicity range (-1.0 dex &lt;[Fe/H] &lt;0.5 dex) and the temperature range (4500-5200 K). The calibrations achieve high precision for all bands, enabling accurate determination of RC absolute magnitudes and distances. Furthermore, we evaluate the metallicity estimation capabilities of both systems using a Random Forest-based method, achieving a precision of 0.12 dex for Mephisto and 0.14 dex for CSST under typical photometric uncertainties (&lt; 0.01 mag). These results provide robust tools for distance and metallicity determinations, supporting future Galactic structure studies with Mephisto and CSST data.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Radio-frequency Interference Classification with Unsupervised Learning in Narrowband Radio Technosignature Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for radio technosignatures is an anomaly detection problem: Candidate signals represent needles of interest in the proverbial haystack of radio-frequency interference (RFI). Current search frameworks find an enormity of false-positive signals, especially in large surveys, requiring manual follow-up to a sometimes prohibitive degree. Unsupervised learning provides an algorithmic way to winnow the most anomalous signals from the chaff, as well as group together RFI signals that bear morphological similarities. We present GLOBULAR (Grouping Low-frequency Observations By Unsupervised Learning After Reduction) clustering, a signal processing method that uses HDBSCAN to reduce the false-positive rate and isolate outlier signals for further analysis. When combined with a standard narrowband signal detection and spatial filtering pipeline, such as turboSETI, GLOBULAR clustering offers significant improvements in the false-positive rate over the standard pipeline alone, suggesting dramatic potential for the amelioration of manual follow-up requirements for future large surveys. By removing RFI signals in regions of high spectral occupancy, GLOBULAR clustering may also enable the detection of signals missed by the standard pipeline. We benchmark our method against the Choza et al. turboSETI-only search of 97 nearby galaxies at the L band, demonstrating a false-positive hit reduction rate of 93.1% and a false-positive event reduction rate of 99.3%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of SpectrumMate LR, a broadband, low-resolution spectrograph for small telescope use. SpectrumMate LR is designed to offer affordable, accessible spectroscopic capabilities for amateur astronomers and educators, inspired by the need for versatile instruments in amateur and educational settings. Utilising a 300 grooves/mm grating, 80 mm collimator and objective lenses, SpectrumMate LR is optimised to perform analyses across the visible spectrum, enabling users to classify stars by spectral type, measure stellar temperatures, and test filter transmission ranges. Tests demonstrate SpectrumMate LR's ability to capture accurate spectral data, validating its efficacy in observing both celestial and terrestrial light sources. This instrument fills a niche for cost-effective spectroscopy, empowering a broader audience to engage in detailed observational astronomy.</description>

Abstract: We present the numerical lunar time ephemeris LTE440 based on the definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) given by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in IAU 2024 Resolution II. LTE440 can be used to obtain the numerical transformation between TCL and Solar System Barycentric Dynamical Time (TCL-TDB) or Solar System Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCL-TCB). The theoretical model, numerical method, and performance of LTE440 are discussed. The secular drifts between TCL and TDB and between TCL and TCB are respectively estimated as $\left&lt; d\mathrm{TCL}/d\mathrm{TDB}\right&gt;=1+6.798\,355\,238\times10^{-10}$, and $\left&lt; d\mathrm{TCL}/d\mathrm{TCB}\right&gt;=1-1.482\,536\,216\,67\times10^{-8}$. The most significant periodic terms have amplitudes of about 1651 microseconds for the annual term and 126 microseconds for the monthly term. The precision of LTE440 is estimated to be at the level of several picoseconds. LTE440 is freely available at https://github.com/xlucn/LTE440.</description>

      <title>Science Prospects for the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory: SWGO</title>

Abstract: Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is now well established as a key observational approach to address critical topics at the frontiers of astroparticle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Whilst the field of TeV astronomy was once dominated by arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, ground-level particle detection has now been demonstrated to be an equally viable and strongly complementary approach. Ground-level particle detection provides continuous monitoring of the overhead sky, critical for the mapping of extended structures and capturing transient phenomena. As demonstrated by HAWC and LHAASO, the technique provides the best available sensitivity above a few tens of TeV, and for the first time access to the PeV energy range. Despite the success of this approach, there is so far no major ground-level particle-based observatory with access to the Southern sky. HESS, located in Namibia, is the only major gamma-ray instrument in the Southern Hemisphere, and has shown the extraordinary richness of the inner galaxy in the TeV band, but is limited in terms of field of view and energy reach.
  SWGO is an international effort to construct the first wide-field instrument in the south with deep sensitivity from 100s of GeV into the PeV domain. The project is now close to the end of its development phase and planning for construction of the array in Chile has begun. Here we describe the baseline design, expected sensitivity and resolution, and describe in detail the main scientific topics that will be addressed by this new facility and its initial phase SWGO-A. We show that SWGO will have a transformational impact on a wide range of topics from cosmic-ray acceleration and transport to the nature of dark matter. SWGO represents a key piece of infrastructure for multi-messenger astronomy in the next decade, with strong scientific synergies with the nearby CTA Observatory.</description>
