      <title>PORTAL: Controllable Landscape Generator for Continuous Optimization-Part I: Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking is central to optimization research, yet existing test suites for continuous optimization remain limited: classical collections are fixed and rigid, while previous generators cover only narrow families of landscapes with restricted variability and control over details. This paper introduces PORTAL (Platform for Optimization Research, Testing, Analysis, and Learning), a general benchmark generator that provides fine-grained, independent control over basin curvature, conditioning, variable interactions, and surface ruggedness. PORTAL's layered design spans from individual components to block-wise compositions of multi-component landscapes with controllable partial separability and imbalanced block contributions. It offers precise control over the shape of each component in every dimension and direction, and supports diverse transformation patterns through both element-wise and coupling operators with compositional sequencing. All transformations preserve component centers and local quadratic structure, ensuring stability and interpretability. A principled neutralization mechanism prevents unintended component domination caused by exponent or scale disparities, which addresses a key limitation of prior landscape generators. On this foundation, transformations introduce complex landscape characteristics, such as multimodality, asymmetry, and heterogeneous ruggedness, in a controlled and systematic way. PORTAL enables systematic algorithm analysis by supporting both isolation of specific challenges and progressive difficulty scaling. It also facilitates the creation of diverse datasets for meta-algorithmic research, tailored benchmark suite design, and interactive educational use. The complete Python and MATLAB source code for PORTAL is publicly available at [https://github.com/EvoMindLab/PORTAL].</description>

      <title>Doppler-Enhanced Deep Learning: Improving Thyroid Nodule Segmentation with YOLOv5 Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer globally has led to the development of various computer-aided detection methods. Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses on instance segmentation of thyroid nodules using YOLOv5 algorithms on ultrasound images. We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate that doppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. The YOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\% dice score when doppler images were excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants. These findings suggest that instance segmentation with YOLOv5 provides an effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with potential clinical applications in automated diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>PARD: Accelerating LLM Inference with Low-Cost PARallel Draft Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) fundamentally limits inference speed, as each forward pass generates only a single token and is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising solution, adopting a draft-then-verify strategy to accelerate token generation. While the EAGLE series achieves strong acceleration, its requirement of training a separate draft head for each target model introduces substantial adaptation costs. In this work, we propose \textbf{PARD (PARallel Draft)}, a novel speculative decoding method featuring \textit{target-independence} and \textit{parallel token prediction}. Specifically, PARD enables a single draft model to be applied across an entire family of target models without requiring separate training for each variant, thereby minimizing adaptation costs. Meanwhile, PARD substantially accelerates inference by predicting multiple future tokens within a single forward pass of the draft phase. To further reduce the training adaptation cost of PARD, we propose a COnditional Drop-token (COD) mechanism based on the integrity of prefix key-value states, enabling autoregressive draft models to be adapted into parallel draft models at low-cost. Our experiments show that the proposed COD method improves draft model training efficiency by \textbf{3$\times$} compared with traditional masked prediction training. On the \texttt{vLLM} inference framework, PARD achieves up to \textbf{3.67$\times$} speedup on LLaMA3.1-8B, reaching \textbf{264.88} tokens per second, which is \textbf{1.15$\times$} faster than EAGLE-3. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AIG-AIMA/PARD.</description>
