      <title>On the hypothesis of a bi-isotropic plasma permeating the interstellar space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetized chiral plasma that pervades the interstellar space. The Maxwell equations, supplemented by bi-isotropic constitutive relations, are rewritten to describe a cold, uniform, and collisionless plasma model that yields new collective electromagnetic modes for distinct pairs of refractive indices associated with right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves. We have investigated the optical behavior through the rotatory power (RP) and dichroism coefficient, reporting that the finite chiral parameter induces double RP sign reversal, an exotic optical signature that takes place in chiral dielectrics and rotating plasmas. In the low-frequency regime, a modified propagating helicon with right-handed circular polarization is obtained. Next, supposing that the interstellar medium behaves as a bi-isotropic cold plasma, we employ Astrophysical data of radio pulsars to achieve upper limits on the magnetoelectric parameters magnitude. In particular, by using dispersion measure and rotation measure data from five pulsars, we constrain the magnitude of the chiral parameter to the order of $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-22}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spinning into the Gap: Direct-Horizon Collapse as the Origin of GW231123 from End-to-End GRMHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BH) merger observed to date, involves component BHs with masses inside the pair-instability mass gap and unusually high spins. This challenges standard formation channels such as classical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation and magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior models, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first self-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star from helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation accretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Starting from a $250\,M_\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse above the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields, drives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the formation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass correlation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH through magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion, resulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with weak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $ a\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic fields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for GW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may impart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the post-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse may power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic $\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such events in the early universe.</description>

      <title>What determines the $\gamma$-ray luminosities of classical novae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical novae in the Milky Way have now been well-established as high-energy GeV $\gamma$-ray sources. In novae with main-sequence companions, this emission is believed to result from shocks internal to the nova ejecta, as a later fast wind collides with an earlier slow outflow. To test this model and constrain the $\gamma$-ray production mechanism, we present a systematic study of a sample of recent Galactic novae, comparing their $\gamma$-ray properties ($\gamma$-ray luminosity and duration) with their outflow velocities, peak $V$-band magnitudes, and the decline times of their optical light curves ($t_2$). We uniformly estimate distances in a luminosity-independent manner, using spectroscopic reddening estimates combined with three-dimensional Galactic dust maps. Across our sample, $\gamma$-ray luminosities ($&gt;$100 MeV) vary by three orders of magnitude, spanning $10^{34}-10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Novae with larger velocity of the fast outflow (or larger differential between the fast and slow outflow) have larger $\gamma$-ray luminosities, but are detectable for a shorter duration. The optical and $\gamma$-ray fluxes are correlated, consistent with substantial thermal emission in the optical from shock-heated gas. Across six novae with $\gamma$-ray and infrared light curves, evidence for dust formation appears soon after the end of the detected $\gamma$-ray emission. Dusty and non-dusty novae appear to have similar $\gamma$-ray luminosities, though novae that have more material processed by the shocks may be more likely to form dust. We find that the properties of the $\gamma$-ray emission in novae depend heavily on the ejecta properties, and are consistent with expectations for internal shocks.</description>

      <title>$f$-mode Oscillations for Hyperons and H-dibaryons in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental ($f$-mode) oscillations of neutron stars are studied within the quark meson coupling model, a relativistic Hartree-Fock theory of dense nuclear matter, which takes into account the self-consistent modification of the valence quark structure of the bound baryons in the associated strong Lorentz scalar mean fields. For the first time, hyperons and H-dibaryons are included, along with the effects of potential additional short-range repulsion within this scheme, and their influence on $f$-modes is investigated. Universal relations are studied within the relativistic Cowling approximation and compared against those in the existing literature for potential applications in gravitational wave asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Large Area Telescope Detection of Very High Energy (&gt;100 GeV) Emission from Misaligned Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $&gt;$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray radiation from misaligned jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) challenges the emission models that primarily explain VHE emissions from beamed AGN, i.e., blazars. Using over 16 years of \textit{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (\textit{Fermi}-LAT) Pass 8 data in the energy range 0.1$-$2 TeV, we systematically explore the VHE emission from a recently published sample of 160 radio galaxies. We identify 12 sources detected at $&gt;4\sigma$ confidence level (test statistic or TS$&gt;$16), including nine with TS$&gt;$25 and two Fanaroff-Riley type II objects. This detected sample includes seven out of eight previously known VHE objects. Two radio galaxies are detected in the VHE band for the first time, and we identify three promising candidates with 16$&lt;$TS$&lt;$25. Additionally, 13 objects are identified as candidate VHE emitters with at least one VHE photon detected with the \textit{Fermi}-LAT. These findings expand the sample of known VHE-emitting radio galaxies, whose multiwavelength follow-up observations can help provide insights into the emission mechanisms, jet physics, and the contribution of misaligned AGN to the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background.</description>

      <title>Methods for Estimating Neutron Star Parameters using Multiple Mechanisms for Gravitational Wave Emission Associated with Pulsar Glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several mechanisms for gravitational wave (GW) emission are believed to be associated with pulsar glitches. This emission may be split between long duration continuous waves and short duration bursts. In the Advanced LIGO era, searches for GWs associated with pulsar glitches have only considered continuous wave emission. The increasing sensitivity of the detectors and the prospects for future detectors suggest that astrophysically motivated analyses involving multiple mechanisms may be possible. Here, we present a framework for combining two simple models for GW emission - long duration continuous waves and short duration bursts - to derive more constraining astrophysical implications than a single model would allow. The best limits arise from using models that predict a specific amount of GW emission; however, there are relatively few models that make such predictions. We apply these methods to the December 2016 Vela pulsar glitch and make predictions for how well future observing runs and detectors would improve results. As part of this analysis, we performed a targeted search for GW bursts associated with this glitch and find no signal.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Direction Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Radio Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observatories require unbiased direction reconstruction to enable multi-messenger astronomy with sparse, nanosecond-scale radio pulses. Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the \textit{Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference} framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68\% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\% \pm 2\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, IceCube-Gen2, RNO-G, and BEACON.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry energy at subnuclear densities in protoneutron star crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of matter properties at subnuclear densities on the evolution of protoneutron stars is investigated. Several models of nuclear equation of state (EOS) are constructed with varying saturation parameters, particularly the symmetry energy $S_0$ and its density slope $L$. Using the Thomas--Fermi approximation, the mass and proton numbers of heavy nuclei at subnuclear densities are systematically evaluated, along with their dependence on the EOS. Cooling simulations of protoneutron stars reveal that EOSs with smaller $L$ values lead to a longer cooling timescale and higher average neutrino energies. This behavior is attributed to the enhanced neutrino scattering caused by larger mass numbers, which increases the thermal insulation. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature, marking the onset of crust formation, is found to be higher for EOSs with smaller values of $L$. This is due to the enhanced Coulomb energy associated with larger proton numbers. As a result, despite slower cooling, crust formation occurs earlier for smaller-$L$ EOSs. These findings indicate that the timing of crust formation is sensitive to the EOS and highlight the importance of late-time neutrino observations as probes of the matter properties at subnuclear densities.</description>

      <title>Attenuation Models for Extensive Air Showers Derived from Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At ultra-high energies, the flux of cosmic rays is too low for direct measurements to be meaningful. When a cosmic ray enters the atmosphere, it initiates an extensive air shower, producing a cascade of secondary particles that propagate toward the ground. Large arrays of surface detectors are used to measure these secondary particles upon arrival.
  The signal detected at a specific reference distance from the shower core serves as a proxy for the shower size and, consequently, as a reliable estimator of the energy of primary cosmic ray. However, shower development is influenced by attenuation effects: measured signals at the ground depend on the amount of traversed atmospheric density (column density) through which the shower evolves. Since the column density varies with the inclination of the shower, it is important to account for these attenuation effects to ensure accurate energy estimation.
  In this study, we derive physics-and-geometry-based functional forms to describe attenuation and propose appropriate expansion terms using simple one-dimensional shower-development models, incorporating one or two main particle-cascade components. We then evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of these functional forms using a Monte-Carlo dataset that includes various primary cosmic-ray particles. By directly calibrating the the shower size derived from ground signals to the Monte-Carlo energy, we characterize attenuation behavior across different primary particles, assess the energy dependence of attenuation, and quantify systematic uncertainties introduced by different functional forms.</description>

      <title>Probing the emission geometry of the X-ray pulsar 2S 1417$-$624 during a weak outburst with NICER, IXPE, and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from a multi-mission observational campaign of the transient X-ray pulsar 2S~1417$-$624 during its 2025 outburst, using data from NICER, IXPE, and NuSTAR. Phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectroscopy with NICER and NuSTAR reveal that a typical power-law model with a high-energy cut-off well describes the broadband spectra. Several spectral parameters, however, show clear and systematic modulations with pulse phase, indicating variations in the physical conditions of the emitting plasma over the neutron star's rotation. In particular, IXPE provides the first polarimetric measurements of this source, yielding a phase-averaged polarization degree of $3.3 \pm 1.7\%$ and a polarization angle of ${18}^{\circ} \pm {15}^{\circ}$, both at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. Fitting with the rotating vector model yields a magnetic obliquity of $\theta = 64_{-26}^{+17}$ deg, indicating a significantly inclined magnetic geometry that may approach a quasi-orthogonal configuration. Together, these findings demonstrate pronounced phase-dependent spectral and polarization variability, offering valuable constraints on the geometry and emission processes within the accretion region of this transient X-ray pulsar.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Targeted Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first catalog of targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are on average 2.6$\times$ more constraining than sky-averaged limits. Bayesian model comparisons against a common uncorrelated red noise for the gravitational wave background (GWB) disfavor a CW signal for almost all targets, yielding a mean Bayes factor of $0.87 \pm 0.31$. There are two notable exceptions: SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, ``Rohan'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 3.37(5)$, and SDSS J072908.71+400836.6, ``Gondor'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 2.44(3)$. These Bayes factors correspond to p-values of $0.01$--$0.03$ ($1.9\sigma$--$2.3\sigma$) and $0.05$--$0.08$ ($1.4\sigma$--$1.6\sigma$), respectively, depending on the empirical null distribution. We outline the beginnings of a detection protocol by identifying and carrying out a battery of tests on Rohan and Gondor to verify their binary nature. Notably, when replacing the common uncorrelated red noise model with a Hellings--Downs correlated GWB, Rohan's Bayes factor drops to $1.25(7)$, while Gondor's increases to $3.2(1)$. Both have rich electromagnetic datasets, including optical and infrared variability and spectroscopic features that support their classification as SMBHB candidates, though this was discovered after the targeted searches were complete. Our results suggest more simulations are needed to confirm or refute the nature of these and future SMBHB candidates, while creating a roadmap for targeted CW detection.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensates in Astrophysics and Cosmology: From Quantum Statistics to Cosmic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and their manifestations in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved spacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme gravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and early universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star interiors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial dependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3 pc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in galactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence effects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than previously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Constraining light dark matter in vector-scalar portals with COSI and AMEGO-X</title>

Abstract: Detecting gamma-ray signals that could be due to dark matter (DM) particles would give us invaluable information about the nature of DM. In particular, gamma-ray lines could provide a way to measure the DM mass. The excellent energy resolution of the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) will allow us to probe underexplored regions of the DM parameter space while being sensitive to distinctive spectral features of potential DM signals. In this work, we consider a fermionic sub-GeV DM charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry. Both the DM and the new gauge boson $Z'$ acquire mass from a new singlet scalar. The masses of the new particles in this class of vector-scalar portal models are naturally at the MeV scale, enabling detectable gamma-ray lines in the bandpasses of COSI and proposed missions such as the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X). We estimate the sensitivity of COSI and AMEGO-X to sub-GeV DM in this context, considering a B-L and a purely axial $Z'$ as benchmark examples. We find regions of the parameter space where COSI will provide leading constraints, beyond the strong CMB limits. On the other hand, AMEGO-X would probe most of the viable parameter space leading to continuum gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the extreme mass-ratio inspiral population from LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes, are predicted to be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). A sufficiently large number of EMRI observations will provide unique insights into the massive black hole population. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework capable of constraining the parameters of the EMRI population, accounting for selection biases. We leverage the capacity of a feed-forward neural network as an emulator, enabling detectability calculations of $\sim10^5$ EMRIs in a fraction of a second, speeding up the likelihood evaluation by $\gtrsim6$ orders of magnitude. We validate our framework on a phenomenological EMRI population model. This framework enables studies of how well we can constrain EMRI population parameters, such as the slope of both the massive and stellar-mass black hole mass spectra and the branching fractions of different formation channels, allowing further investigation into the evolution of massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Scalar non-standard neutrino interactions in Galactic supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the prospects for studying scalar non-standard interactions (SNSI) using the neutrino burst from a Galactic supernova. SNSI modify the resonant flavor conversion and, correspondingly, the neutronization burst signal, and may be identifiable in future multi-tonne-scale experiments such as DUNE. We show that, in the presence of SNSI, neutrinos propagating out of the dense supernova environment acquire a density-squared-dependent contribution to their mass-squared differences, which in turn modifies the energy levels of the neutrino mass eigenstates. This phenomenon is not present in less dense environments like the Earth or the Sun. For a given mass ordering, supernova neutrinos can improve the sensitivity to SNSI parameters by up to four orders of magnitude compared to that achievable with solar or terrestrial neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>The influence of the 3D Galactic gas structure on cosmic-ray transport and $\gamma$-ray emission</title>

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) play a major role in the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM). Their interactions and transport ionize, heat, and push the ISM thereby coupling different regions of it. The spatial distribution of CRs depends on the distribution of their sources as well as the ISM constituents they interact with, such as gas, starlight, and magnetic fields. Particularly, gas influences CR fluxes and $\gamma$-ray emission. We illustrate the influence of realistic and largely structured 3D gas distributions on CR transport and $\gamma$-ray emission, by studying their correlation using the PICARD code and multiple samples of recent 3D reconstructions of the HI and H2 Galactic gas constituents. We adjust the diffusion coefficient $D_{xx}$ and Alfv\'en speed $v_{\text{A}}$ to reproduce local measurements of B/C abundances and find that these parameters depend non-linearly on the local distribution of gas. When simulating CR transport, the distributions of CR fluxes exhibit energy-dependent structures that vary for all CR species due to their corresponding loss processes. Regions of enhanced secondary (primary) species are spatially correlated (anti-correlated) with the gas density. Furthermore, we show that the morphology of gas clouds alone impacts CR flux predictions. For $\gamma$-ray emission, we observe a high sensitivity of the $\gamma$-ray emissivities to gas structures, as these determine the spatial distributions of hadronic interactions and bremsstrahlung. This way, we have for the first time calculated how well-defined uncertainties in a structured gas model propagate to CR transport and $\gamma$-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Measurement of separate electron and positron spectra from 10 GeV to 20GeV with the geomagnetic field on DAMPE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and positrons in space are of great significance for studying the origin and propagation of cosmic-rays. The satellite-borne experiment DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) has been used to measure the separate electron and positron spectra, as well as the positron fraction. In this work, the Earth's magnetic field is used to distinguish CR electrons and positrons, as the DAMPE detector does not carry an onboard magnet. The energy range for the measurements is from 10 to 20 GeV, being currently limited at high energy by the zenith pointing orientation of DAMPE. The results are consistent with previous measurements based on the magnetic spectrometer by AMS-02 and PAMELA, while the results of Fermi-LAT seem then to be systematically shifted to larger values.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the structure of the stratified ultra-fast outflows in PDS 456 with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple clumpy wind components ($v_{out}\sim0.2-0.3c$) in the luminous quasar PDS 456 have recently been resolved by XRISM in the Fe-K band for the first time. In this paper, we investigate the structure of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) using coordinated observations from XRISM, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, along with the self-consistently calculated photoionization model \texttt{PION}. Our results reveal a stratified ionization structure, characterized by a relation between wind velocity and ionization parameter $v_{out}\propto\xi^{(0.14\pm0.04)}$. To evaluate the impact of the screening effect, we tested all possible order permutations of six \texttt{PION} components. We find that highly ionized UFOs ($\log\xi&gt;4.5$) are insensitive to their relative positions, whereas the soft X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim3$ and $v_{out}\sim0.27c$) and the lowest-ionized hard X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim4.1$ and $v_ {out}\sim0.23c$) are statistically favored -- based on the evidence from both the C-statistic and Bayesian analysis -- to occupy the middle and innermost layers, respectively. This suggests a possible trend where slower UFOs are launched from regions closer to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The soft X-ray UFO is found to be thermally unstable, regardless of its relative position. However, its location remains unclear. Our sequence analysis and its similarity to hard X-ray UFOs suggest that they may be co-spatial, while variability constraints support its location within the broad-line region at sub-parsec scales. Simulations with the gate-valve opened XRISM show that high-resolution soft X-ray data can enhance the reliability of our results. Furthermore, simulations with the future X-ray mission NewAthena demonstrate its capability to resolve the absorber sequence and spatial distributions, enabling the determination of UFO structures and their roles in AGN feedback.</description>

Abstract: The eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) and eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) data have already revealed a remarkable number of undiscovered X-ray sources. Using Bayesian inference and generative modeling techniques for X-ray imaging, we aim to increase the sensitivity and scientific value of these observations by denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing the X-ray sky. Leveraging information field theory, we can exploit the spatial and spectral correlation structures of the different physical components of the sky with non-parametric priors to enhance the image reconstruction. By incorporating instrumental effects into the forward model, we develop a comprehensive Bayesian imaging algorithm for eROSITA pointing observations. Finally, we apply the developed algorithm to EDR data of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SN1987A, fusing data sets from observations made by five different telescope modules. The final result is a denoised, deconvolved, and decomposed view of the LMC, which enables the analysis of its fine-scale structures, the identification of point sources in this region, and enhanced calibration for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with BEC Dark Matter density profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of Traversable Wormhole (TW) in the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) gravity is explored with phenomenological Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) dark matter density profile. In the framework of 4D EGB gravity, which one obtains by regularizing the higher-dimensional EGB gravity in the limit $D \to 4$ is considered to obtain a spherically symmetric TW. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter ($\alpha$) in this case is rescaled to $\alpha \to \frac{\alpha}{D-4}$. Considering the energy density profile of non-relativistic BEC matter, the shape function of the WH geometry and the Null energy condition (NEC) are determined with a constant redshift function. The applicability of realistic flaring-out condition and asymptotic flatness conditions are studied here and the domain of model parameters for realistic scenario is determined. We analyze the embedding diagram of the WH obtained here with proper radial distance, volume integral quantifier, and anisotropy. We obtained WH which is stable at the throat when $\alpha = -0.0512471$ for a set of model parameters, which is estimated from sound speed measurement. The energy conditions are investigated, and it is noted that there is a range of Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha \in [-4,-4.222]$, at which the energy conditions, including NEC, are obeyed at the throat. We explore NEC for other values of $\alpha$ and found that it is not satisfied. The other energy conditions are also violated. A new result is thus obtained with 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with BEC Dark Matter profile. We determine the parameter space for which the WH solution exists in the proposed modified gravity model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. For this work, we discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. We show that our GB inflationary scenario is consistent with present PTA and cosmological data. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. Using observational constraints, we derive general conditions for the inflaton potential and the GB coupling function, suggesting that in GB inflation, the inflaton must climb up the potential before rolling downhill and reaching the end of inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary models to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Parametric and Magnetorotational Instabilities in Oscillatory Shear Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear flows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be vigorously unstable to a hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped systems, this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability (MRI). The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the internal flows has not been studied. To this end, we perform three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory radial forcing function to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the hydrodynamic study, we find that the parametric instability manifests as strong, vertical `elevator' flows that resist the sloshing motion. Above a critical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and dominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI, and hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this critical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In all cases, we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and better described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows. Unfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global simulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable models. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent, viscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response and inevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.</description>

Open clusters in particular are more abundant over cosmic time than globular clusters, however, previous research on low-mass clusters with $\lesssim 10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ has focused on binary black holes (BBHs) or black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries. Binary mergers of other compact objects, such as white dwarfs (WDs), are also crucial as progenitors of transient phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae and Fast Radio Bursts. We present simulations of three types of open clusters with masses of $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In massive clusters with $\gtrsim 10^4~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$, BBHs are dynamically formed, however, less massive compact binaries such as WD-WD and WD-NS are perturbed inside the star clusters, causing them to evolve into other objects. We further find BH-NS mergers only in $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Considering star clusters with a typical open cluster mass, we observe that WD-WD merger rates slightly increase for $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters but decrease for $10^2~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Since the host clusters are tidally disrupted, most of them merge outside of the clusters. Our WD-WD merger results have further implications for two classes of transients. Super-Chandrasekhar WD-WD mergers are present in our simulations, demonstrating potential sources of Fast Radio Bursts at a rate of 70-780 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, higher than the rate estimated for globular clusters. Additionally, we find that Carbon-Oxygen WD-WD mergers in our open clusters (34-640 $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$) only account for 0.14-2.6% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate in our local Universe.</description>
