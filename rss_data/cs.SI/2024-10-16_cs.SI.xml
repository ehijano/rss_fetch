      <title>SHyPar: A Spectral Coarsening Approach to Hypergraph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art hypergraph partitioners utilize a multilevel paradigm to construct progressively coarser hypergraphs across multiple layers, guiding cut refinements at each level of the hierarchy. Traditionally, these partitioners employ heuristic methods for coarsening and do not consider the structural features of hypergraphs. In this work, we introduce a multilevel spectral framework, SHyPar, for partitioning large-scale hypergraphs by leveraging hyperedge effective resistances and flow-based community detection techniques. Inspired by the latest theoretical spectral clustering frameworks, such as HyperEF and HyperSF, SHyPar aims to decompose large hypergraphs into multiple subgraphs with few inter-partition hyperedges (cut size). A key component of SHyPar is a flow-based local clustering scheme for hypergraph coarsening, which incorporates a max-flow-based algorithm to produce clusters with substantially improved conductance. Additionally, SHyPar utilizes an effective resistance-based rating function for merging nodes that are strongly connected (coupled). Compared with existing state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning methods, our extensive experimental results on real-world VLSI designs demonstrate that SHyPar can more effectively partition hypergraphs, achieving state-of-the-art solution quality.</description>

      <title>Understanding U.S. Racial Segregation Through Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Racial segregation is a widespread social and physical phenomenon present in every city across the United States. Although prevalent nationwide, each city has a unique history of racial segregation, resulting in distinct "shapes" of segregation. We use persistent homology, a technique from applied algebraic topology, to investigate whether common patterns of racial segregation exist among U.S. cities. We explore two methods of constructing simplicial complexes that preserve geospatial data, applying them to White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic demographic data from the U.S. census for 112 U.S. cities. Using these methods, we cluster the cities based on their persistence to identify groups with similar segregation "shapes". Finally, we apply cluster analysis techniques to explore the characteristics of our clusters. This includes calculating the mean cluster statistics to gain insights into the demographics of each cluster and using the Adjusted Rand Index to compare our results with other clustering methods.</description>

      <title>GCLS$^2$: Towards Efficient Community Detection using Graph Contrastive Learning with Structure Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to powerful ability to learn representations from unlabeled graphs, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown excellent performance in community detection tasks. Existing GCL-based methods on the community detection usually focused on learning attribute representations of individual nodes, which, however, ignores structure semantics of communities (e.g., nodes in the same community should be close to each other). Therefore, in this paper, we will consider the semantics of community structures for the community detection, and propose an effective framework of graph contrastive learning under structure semantics (GCLS$^2$) for detecting communities. To seamlessly integrate interior dense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive learning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level structural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment the original structural feature representation. Moreover, we formulate the structure contrastive loss to optimize the feature representation of nodes, which can better capture the topology of communities. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various real-world graph datasets and confirmed that GCLS$^2$ outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the accuracy and modularity of the detected communities.</description>

      <title>Modelling advection on distance-weighted directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a model for describing advection dynamics on distance-weighted directed graphs. To this end we establish a set of key properties, or axioms, that a discrete advection operator should satisfy, and prove that there exists an essentially unique operator satisfying all such properties. Both infinite and finite networks are considered, as well as possible variants and extensions. We illustrate the proposed model through examples, both analytical and numerical, and we describe an application to the simulation of a traffic network.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair Graph Representation Learning in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning from network data, the fairness of GNN models has raised great attention lately. Fair GNNs aim to ensure that node representations can be accurately classified, but not easily associated with a specific group. Existing advanced approaches essentially enhance the generalisation of node representation in combination with data augmentation strategy, and do not directly impose constraints on the fairness of GNNs. In this work, we identify that a fundamental reason for the unfairness of GNNs in social network learning is the phenomenon of social homophily, i.e., users in the same group are more inclined to congregate. The message-passing mechanism of GNNs can cause users in the same group to have similar representations due to social homophily, leading model predictions to establish spurious correlations with sensitive attributes. Inspired by this reason, we propose a method called Equity-Aware GNN (EAGNN) towards fair graph representation learning. Specifically, to ensure that model predictions are independent of sensitive attributes while maintaining prediction performance, we introduce constraints for fair representation learning based on three principles: sufficiency, independence, and separation. We theoretically demonstrate that our EAGNN method can effectively achieve group fairness. Extensive experiments on three datasets with varying levels of social homophily illustrate that our EAGNN method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across two fairness metrics and offers competitive effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the MrDeepFakes Sexual Deepfake Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of sexual deepfake material has exploded over the past several years. Attackers create and utilize deepfakes for many reasons: to seek sexual gratification, to harass and humiliate targets, or to exert power over an intimate partner. In tandem with this growth, several markets have emerged to support the buying and selling of sexual deepfake material. In this paper, we systematically characterize the most prominent and mainstream marketplace, MrDeepFakes. We analyze the marketplace economics, the targets of created media, and user discussions of how to create deepfakes, which we use to understand the current state-of-the-art in deepfake creation. Our work uncovers little enforcement of posted rules (e.g., limiting targeting to well-established celebrities), previously undocumented attacker motivations, and unexplored attacker tactics for acquiring resources to create sexual deepfakes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of personal relationships remain largely unexplored due to the inherent difficulties of the longitudinal data collection process. In this paper, we analyse a dataset tracking the temporal evolution of a network of personal relationships among 900 people over the course of four years. We search for evidence that the network is in equilibrium, meaning that all macroscopic properties remain constant, fluctuating around stable values, while the internal microscopic dynamics are active. We find that the probabilities governing the network dynamics are stationary over time and that the degree distributions, as well as edge and triangle abundances match the theoretical equilibrium distributions expected under these dynamics. Furthermore, we verify that the system satisfies the detailed balance condition, with only minor point deviations, confirming that it is indeed in equilibrium. Remarkably, this equilibrium persists despite a high turnover in network composition, suggesting that it is an inherent characteristic of human social interactions rather than a trait of the individuals themselves. We argue that this equilibrium may be a general feature of human social networks arising from the competition between different dynamical mechanisms and also from the cognitive and material resources management of individuals. From a practical perspective, the fact that networks are in equilibrium could simplify data collection processes, validate the use of cross-sectional data-based methods like Exponential Random Graph Models, and inform the design of interventions. Our findings advance the understanding of collective human behaviour predictability and our ability to describe it using simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>AI Rules? Characterizing Reddit Community Policies Towards AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How are Reddit communities responding to AI-generated content? We explored this question through a large-scale analysis of subreddit community rules and their change over time. We collected the metadata and community rules for over 300,000 public subreddits and measured the prevalence of rules governing AI. We labeled subreddits and AI rules according to existing taxonomies from the HCI literature and a new taxonomy we developed specific to AI rules. While rules about AI are still relatively uncommon, the number of subreddits with these rules almost doubled over the course of a year. AI rules are also more common in larger subreddits and communities focused on art or celebrity topics, and less common in those focused on social support. These rules often focus on AI images and evoke, as justification, concerns about quality and authenticity. Overall, our findings illustrate the emergence of varied concerns about AI, in different community contexts.</description>

      <title>Framing the Fray: Evaluating Conflict and Game Frames in Indian Election News Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Journalists often use conflict frames when reporting on election news stories. A conflict frame depicts events and issues as contentious or adversarial, often highlighting confrontations between opposing parties or groups. In this work, we examine the use of conflict frames in online news articles published by seven major news outlets in the 2014 and 2019 Indian general elections. We find that the use of conflict frames in Indian online media is not linked to the media outlets' ideological biases but is associated with TV-based (rather than print-based) media. Further, the majority of news outlets do not exhibit ideological biases in portraying parties as aggressors or targets in articles with conflict frames. Finally, we find while these outlets consistently report on mentions of the opposition party, they underreport more substantive electoral issues such as farmers' issues and infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Relationship Between News Source Sharing and Political Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an era marked by an abundance of news sources, access to information significantly influences public opinion. Notably, the bias of news sources often serves as an indicator of individuals' political leanings. This study explores this hypothesis by examining the news sharing behavior of politically active social media users, whose political ideologies were identified in a previous study. Using correspondence analysis, we estimate the Media Sharing Index (MSI), a measure that captures bias in media outlets and user preferences within a hidden space. During Argentina's 2019 election on Twitter, we observed a predictable pattern: center-right individuals predominantly shared media from center-right biased outlets. However, it is noteworthy that those with center-left inclinations displayed a more diverse media consumption, which is a significant finding. Despite a noticeable polarization based on political affiliation observed in a retweet network analysis, center-left users showed more diverse media sharing preferences, particularly concerning the MSI. Although these findings are specific to Argentina, the developed methodology can be applied in other countries to assess the correlation between users' political leanings and the media they share.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trigger points, introduced by Mau et al . [30], are rooted in theories of affective political identity and relate to deeply lying beliefs about moral expectations and social dispositions. Examining trigger points in online discussions helps understand why and when social media users engage in disagreements or affective political deliberations. This opens the door to modelling social media user engagement more effectively and studying the conditions and causal mechanisms that lead to adverse reactions, hate speech, and abusive language in online debates.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Based Graph Neural Networks for Complementary Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling complementary relationships greatly helps recommender systems to accurately and promptly recommend the subsequent items when one item is purchased. Unlike traditional similar relationships, items with complementary relationships may be purchased successively (such as iPhone and Airpods Pro), and they not only share relevance but also exhibit dissimilarity. Since the two attributes are opposites, modeling complementary relationships is challenging. Previous attempts to exploit these relationships have either ignored or oversimplified the dissimilarity attribute, resulting in ineffective modeling and an inability to balance the two attributes. Since Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can capture the relevance and dissimilarity between nodes in the spectral domain, we can leverage spectral-based GNNs to effectively understand and model complementary relationships. In this study, we present a novel approach called Spectral-based Complementary Graph Neural Networks (SComGNN) that utilizes the spectral properties of complementary item graphs. We make the first observation that complementary relationships consist of low-frequency and mid-frequency components, corresponding to the relevance and dissimilarity attributes, respectively. Based on this spectral observation, we design spectral graph convolutional networks with low-pass and mid-pass filters to capture the low-frequency and mid-frequency components. Additionally, we propose a two-stage attention mechanism to adaptively integrate and balance the two attributes. Experimental results on four e-commerce datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, with SComGNN significantly outperforming existing baseline models.</description>

      <title>Information propagation dynamics in Deep Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a highly expressive abstraction for modeling entities and their relations, such as molecular structures, social networks, and traffic networks. Deep Graph Networks (DGNs) have emerged as a family of deep learning models that can effectively process and learn such structured information. However, learning effective information propagation patterns within DGNs remains a critical challenge that heavily influences the model capabilities, both in the static domain and in the temporal domain (where features and/or topology evolve). Given this challenge, this thesis investigates the dynamics of information propagation within DGNs for static and dynamic graphs, focusing on their design as dynamical systems. Throughout this work, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architectures in propagating and preserving long-term dependencies between nodes, and in learning complex spatio-temporal patterns from irregular and sparsely sampled dynamic graphs. In summary, this thesis provides a comprehensive exploration of the intersection between graphs, deep learning, and dynamical systems, offering insights and advancements for the field of graph representation learning and paving the way for more effective and versatile graph-based learning models.</description>
