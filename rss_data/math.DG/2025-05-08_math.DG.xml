      <title>Conformal Holonomy of the Bivariate Gaussian Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical manifolds, the parameter spaces of smooth families of probability density functions, are the central objects of study in information geometry. While the elementary differential geometry of Riemannian statistical manifolds is well-known, their conformal geometry remains entirely unexplored. In this article, we begin this programme of exploration by determining some invariants of the conformal structure of the Fisher-Rao metric. Specifically, we study the holonomy of a conformally-invariant connection on the standard tractor bundle of the bivariate Gaussian manifold. It is found that for a generic pair of random variables, the conformal holonomy group is the identity-connected component of the indefinite special orthogonal group, $SO^{0}(1,6)$. Remarkably, however, when the random variables are statistically independent, the conformal holonomy representation is reducible and the conformal holonomy group is $SO^{0}(1,4)$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic characterization of projective special complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of an $S^1$-bundle of projective special complex base type and construct a conical special complex manifold from it. Consequently the base space of such an $S^{1}$-bundle can be realized as $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$-quotient of a conical special complex manifold. As a corollary, we give an intrinsic characterization of a projective special complex manifold generalizing Mantegazza's characterization of a projective special K\"ahler manifold. Our characterization is in the language of c-projective structures. As an application, a non-trivial $S^1$-family of Obata-Ricci-flat hypercomplex structures (given by a generalization of the rigid c-map) on the tangent bundle of the total space of a $\mathbb{C}^*$-bundle over a complex manifold with certain kind of c-projective structure is constructed. Finally, we show that the quaternionic structure underlying any of these hypercomplex structures is in general not flat and that its flatness implies the vanishing of the c-projective Weyl tensor of the base of the $\mathbb{C}^*$-bundle. Conversely, any c-projectively flat complex manifold satisfying a cohomological integrality condition gives rise to a flat quaternionic structure.</description>

      <title>Existence of metrics maximizing the first Laplace eigenvalue on closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on seminal work of Nadirashvili and previous work of the authors, we prove the existence of metrics maximizing the area-normalized first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on every closed nonorientable surface, and give a simple new proof of existence in the orientable case complementing that of [Pet24b], thus resolving the long-standing existence problem for $\lambda_1$-maximizing metrics on closed surfaces of any topology. Namely, we prove by contradiction that the supremum $\Lambda_1(M)$ of the normalized first eigenvalue over all metrics on $M$ obeys the strict monotonicity $\Lambda_1(M\#\mathbb{RP}^2)&gt;\Lambda_1(M)$ and $\Lambda_1(M\#\mathbb{T}^2)&gt;\Lambda_1(M)$ under the attachment of cross-caps and handles, via a substantial refinement of techniques introduced in [KKMS24].</description>

      <title>Prime scattering geodesic theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modular surface, given by the quotient $\mathcal{M} = \Ha/\text{PSL}(2,\Z)$, can be partitioned into a compact subset $\Mm$ and an open neighborhood of the unique cusp in $\mathcal{M}$. We consider scattering geodesics in $\mathcal{M}$, first introduced by Victor Guillemin in \cite{Guillemin1976-xr} for hyperbolic surfaces with cusps. These are geodesics in $\mathcal{M}$ that lie in $\mathcal{M} \setminus \Mm$ for both large positive and negative times. Associated with such a scattering geodesic in $\mathcal{M}$, a finite \textit{sojourn time} is defined in \cite{Guillemin1976-xr}. In this article, we study the distribution of these scattering geodesics in $\mathcal{M}$ and their associated \textit{sojourn times}. In this process, we establish a connection between the counting of scattering geodesics on the modular surface and the study of positive integers whose prime divisors lie in arithmetic progression. This article is the first such result for scattering geodesics.</description>

      <title>Point vortex on surfaces with continuous symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.09523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an analytic formula for the hydrodynamic Green function and the Robin function on every orientable surface admitting a hydrodynamic Killing vector field. Closed-form expressions are provided for all fourteen canonical Riemann surfaces, covering both compact and non-compact cases; the formulae satisfy the slip boundary condition and generate complete Hamiltonian vector fields. As an application, we clarify the mechanism whereby the curvature affects a point vortex in both qualitative and quantitative viewpoints. Qualitatively, we show a single point vortex is governed by a Hamiltonian flow whose vorticity is given by the curvature up to area constant. Quantitatively, on a rectangular torus with periodic curvature we use the analytic formula to describe two regimes: linear response that mirrors the curvature wave when the mean component is small, and a nonlinear response with amplitude resonance. The results supply a unified tool for detailed studies of point vortex dynamics and Euler-Arnold flows on surfaces with continuous symmetry.</description>

      <title>Static manifolds with boundary: Their geometry and some uniqueness theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static manifolds with boundary were recently introduced to mathematics. This kind of manifold appears naturally in the prescribed scalar curvature problem on manifolds with boundary when the mean curvature of the boundary is also prescribed. They are also interesting from the point of view of general relativity. For example, the (time-slice of the) photon sphere on the Riemannian Schwarzschild manifold splits it into static manifolds with boundary. In this paper, we prove a number of theorems that relate the topology and geometry of a given static manifold with boundary to some properties of the zero-level set of its potential (such as connectedness and closedness). Also, we characterize the round ball in the Euclidean 3-space with standard potential as the only scalar-flat static manifold with mean-convex boundary whose zero-level set of the potential has Morse index one. This result follows from a general isoperimetric inequality for 3-dimensional static manifolds with boundary, whose zero-level set of the potential has Morse index one. Finally, we prove some uniqueness theorems for the domains bounded by the photon sphere on the Riemannian Schwarzschild manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abundant second-order maximally conformally superintegrable Hamiltonian systems are re-examined, revealing their underlying natural Weyl structure and offering a clearer geometric context for the study of St\"ackel transformations (also known as coupling constant metamorphosis). This also allows us to naturally extend the concept of conformal superintegrability from the realm of conformal geometries to that of Weyl structures. It enables us to interpret superintegrable systems of the above type as semi-Weyl structures, a concept related to statistical manifolds and affine hypersurface theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the framework of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry to Riemann-Cartan geometry, which addresses connections with torsion. This procedure naturally introduces a 2-form on submanifolds associated with the nontrivial ambient torsion, whose Hodge dual plays the role of an imaginary counterpart to mean curvature for surfaces in a Riemann-Cartan 3-manifold. We observe that this complex-valued geometric quantity interacts with a number of other geometric concepts including the Hopf differential and the Gauss map, which generalizes classical minimal surface theory.</description>

Abstract: We extend the topological results of Lytchak-Nagano and Lytchak-Nagano-Stadler for CAT(0) spaces to the setting of Busemann spaces of nonpositive curvature, i.e., BNPC spaces. We give a characterization of locally BNPC topological manifolds in terms of their links and show that the singular set of a locally BNPC homology manifold is discrete. We also prove that any (globally) BNPC topological 4-manifold is homeomorphic to Euclidean space. Applications include a topological stability theorem for locally BNPC G-spaces. Our arguments also apply to spaces admitting convex geodesic bicombings.</description>

      <title>Flow lines on the moduli space of rank $2$ twisted Higgs bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the gradient flow lines for the $L^2$ norm square of the Higgs field defined on the moduli space of semistable rank $2$ Higgs bundles twisted by a line bundle of positive degree over a compact Riemann surface $X$. The main result is that these spaces of flow lines have an algebro-geometric classification in terms of secant varieties for different embeddings of $X$ into the projectivisation of the negative eigenspace of the Hessian at a critical point. The Morse-theoretic compactification of spaces of flow lines given by adding broken flow lines then has a natural algebraic interpretation via a projection to Bertram's resolution of secant varieties.</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows II: geometric structures for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a non-compact semisimple real Lie group $G$ and an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$, we utilize the correspondence between $\mathbb R$-valued additive characters on Levi subgroups $L$ of $G$ and $\mathbb R$-affine homogeneous line bundles over $G/L$ to systematically construct families of non-empty domains of proper discontinuity for the $\Gamma$-action. If $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, the analytic dynamical systems on the quotients are Axiom A, and assemble into a single partially hyperbolic multiflow. Each Axiom A system admits global analytic stable/unstable foliations with non-wandering set a single basic set on which the flow is conjugate to Sambarino's refraction flow, establishing that all refraction flows arise in this fashion. Furthermore, the $\mathbb R$-valued additive character is regular if and only if the associated Axiom A system admits a compatible pseudo-Riemannian metric and contact structure, which we relate to the Poisson structure on the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. In particular, it admits a good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely, the existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local behaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such singular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric cone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical (local) $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric rescaling. Our theory also fits well to singularities on many hyperKahler reductions.</description>
