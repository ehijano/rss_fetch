      <title>Predicting Parkinson's disease trajectory using clinical and functional MRI features: a reproduction and replication study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology. In clinical practice, challenges are encountered in the diagnosis of early stages and in the prediction of the disease progression due to the absence of established biomarkers. Several biomarkers obtained using neuroimaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have been studied recently. However, the reliability and generalizability of neuroimaging-based measurements are susceptible to several different sources of variability, including those introduced by different analysis methods or population sampling. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to reproduce (same data, same method) and replicate (different data or method) the models described in Nguyen et al. 2021 to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We used the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in  Nguyen et al. 2021 and tried to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. Using the reproduction workflow, we managed to obtain better than chance performance for all our models (R2&gt;0), but this performance remained very different from the ones reported in the original study. The challenges encountered while reproducing and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future, for instance with the use of version control tools, standardization of pipelines and publication of analysis code and derived data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Videogames have been a catalyst for advances in many research fields, such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction or virtual reality. Over the years, research in fields such as artificial intelligence has enabled the design of new types of games, while games have often served as a powerful tool for testing and simulation. Can this also happen with neuroscience? What is the current relationship between neuroscience and games research? what can we expect from the future? In this article, we'll try to answer these questions, analysing the current state-of-the-art at the crossroads between neuroscience and games and envisioning future directions.</description>

      <title>Towards auditory attention decoding with noise-tagging: A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) aims to extract from brain activity the attended speaker amidst candidate speakers, offering promising applications for neuro-steered hearing devices and brain-computer interfacing. This pilot study makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch speech stimuli that were amplitude modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to decode noise-codes. Our pilot study revealed higher performances for the conventional method with 70 to 100 percent modulation depths compared to unmodulated audio. The noise-code decoder did not further improve these results. These fundamental insights highlight the potential of integrating noise-codes in speech to enhance auditory speaker detection when multiple speakers are presented simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Altered patterning of neural activity in a tauopathy mouse model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that manifests at multiple levels and involves a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from the cellular to cognitive. Here, we investigate the impact of AD-related tau-pathology on hippocampal circuits in mice engaged in spatial navigation, and study changes of neuronal firing and dynamics of extracellular fields. While most studies are based on analyzing instantaneous or time-averaged characteristics of neuronal activity, we focus on intermediate timescales -- spike trains and waveforms of oscillatory potentials, which we consider as single entities. We find that, in healthy mice, spike arrangements and wave patterns (series of crests or troughs) are coupled to the animal's location, speed, and acceleration. In contrast, in tau-mice, neural activity is structurally disarrayed: brainwave cadence is detached from locomotion, spatial selectivity is lost, the spike flow is scrambled. Importantly, these alterations start early and accumulate with age, which exposes progressive disinvolvement the hippocampus circuit in spatial navigation. These features highlight qualitatively different neurodynamics than the ones provided by conventional analyses, and are more salient, thus revealing a new level of the hippocampal circuit disruptions.</description>

      <title>An image-computable model of speeded decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are the dominant framework for modeling response time (RT) data from speeded decision-making tasks. While providing a good quantitative description of RT data in terms of abstract perceptual representations, EAMs do not explain how the visual system extracts these representations in the first place. To address this limitation, we introduce the visual accumulator model (VAM), in which convolutional neural network models of visual processing and traditional EAMs are jointly fitted to trial-level RTs and raw (pixel-space) visual stimuli from individual subjects. Models fitted to large-scale cognitive training data from a stylized flanker task captured individual differences in congruency effects, RTs, and accuracy. We find evidence that the selection of task-relevant information occurs through the orthogonalization of relevant and irrelevant representations, demonstrating how our framework can be used to relate visual representations to behavioral outputs. Together, our work provides a probabilistic framework for both constraining neural network models of vision with behavioral data and studying how the visual system extracts representations that guide decisions.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain</title>

Abstract: Effective learning in neuronal networks requires the adaptation of individual synapses given their relative contribution to solving a task. However, physical neuronal systems -- whether biological or artificial -- are constrained by spatio-temporal locality. How such networks can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In Machine Learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space (BP) and time (BPTT). However, BP(TT) is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatiotemporal (non-)locality, while forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) suffer from prohibitive memory constraints. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of BPTT in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, performing an effective spatiotemporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint states necessary for useful parameter updates.</description>

      <title>A Number Sense as an Emergent Property of the Manipulating Brain</title>

Abstract: The ability to understand and manipulate numbers and quantities emerges during childhood, but the mechanism through which humans acquire and develop this ability is still poorly understood. We explore this question through a model, assuming that the learner is able to pick up and place small objects from, and to, locations of its choosing, and will spontaneously engage in such undirected manipulation. We further assume that the learner's visual system will monitor the changing arrangements of objects in the scene and will learn to predict the effects of each action by comparing perception with a supervisory signal from the motor system. We model perception using standard deep networks for feature extraction and classification, and gradient descent learning. Our main finding is that, from learning the task of action prediction, an unexpected image representation emerges exhibiting regularities that foreshadow the perception and representation of numbers and quantity. These include distinct categories for zero and the first few natural numbers, a strict ordering of the numbers, and a one-dimensional signal that correlates with numerical quantity. As a result, our model acquires the ability to estimate numerosity, i.e. the number of objects in the scene, as well as subitization, i.e. the ability to recognize at a glance the exact number of objects in small scenes. Remarkably, subitization and numerosity estimation extrapolate to scenes containing many objects, far beyond the three objects used during training. We conclude that important aspects of a facility with numbers and quantities may be learned with supervision from a simple pre-training task. Our observations suggest that cross-modal learning is a powerful learning mechanism that may be harnessed in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Bayesian inference emerge from energy efficient synapses</title>

Abstract: Biological synaptic transmission is unreliable, and this unreliability likely degrades neural circuit performance. While there are biophysical mechanisms that can increase reliability, for instance by increasing vesicle release probability, these mechanisms cost energy. We examined four such mechanisms along with the associated scaling of the energetic costs. We then embedded these energetic costs for reliability in artificial neural networks (ANN) with trainable stochastic synapses, and trained these networks on standard image classification tasks. The resulting networks revealed a tradeoff between circuit performance and the energetic cost of synaptic reliability. Additionally, the optimised networks exhibited two testable predictions consistent with pre-existing experimental data. Specifically, synapses with lower variability tended to have 1) higher input firing rates and 2) lower learning rates. Surprisingly, these predictions also arise when synapse statistics are inferred through Bayesian inference. Indeed, we were able to find a formal, theoretical link between the performance-reliability cost tradeoff and Bayesian inference. This connection suggests two incompatible possibilities: evolution may have chanced upon a scheme for implementing Bayesian inference by optimising energy efficiency, or alternatively, energy efficient synapses may display signatures of Bayesian inference without actually using Bayes to reason about uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces surged extraordinary developments in recent years, and a significant discrepancy now exists between the abundance of available data and the limited headway made in achieving a unified theoretical framework. This discrepancy becomes particularly pronounced when examining the collective neural activity at the micro- and meso-scale, where a coherent formalization that adequately describes neural interactions is still lacking. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework to analyze systems of natural neurons and interpret the related empirical observations in terms of lattice field theory, an established paradigm from theoretical particle physics and statistical mechanics. Our methods are tailored to interpret data from chronic neural interfaces, especially spike rasters from measurements of single neurons activity, and generalize the maximum entropy model for neural networks so that also the time evolution of the system is taken into account. This is obtained by bridging particle physics and neuroscience, paving the way to particle physics-inspired models of neocortex.</description>

      <title>The neuron as a temporal electroacoustic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain is one of the most complex and intriguing scientific topics. The most established theory on neuronal communication is a pure electrical model based on the propagation of intracell cationic charges along the neurons. Here we propose a complementary model based on two properties of brain communication: A) The Coulomb interaction associated to the Action Potential (AP) pulse induces a deformation of the neuron membrane which travels as an acoustic signal, i.e.: The ions play an essential role and the electric and acoustic signals, composing the AP, are strongly correlated. B) As brain communication is stablished through a periodic train of AP pulses it induces a time periodic modulation of the acoustic parameters. In this framework we propose envisaging the neuron as a temporal electro-acoustic medium. The temporal varying media framework could help understanding brain conundrums such as propagation routes involved in the neuronal plasticity in the consolidation of the memory, as well as on the generation of the signals associated to the brain field theory.</description>
