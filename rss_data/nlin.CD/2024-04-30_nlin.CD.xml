      <title>Fractional damping enhances chaos in the nonlinear Helmholtz oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to study both the underdamped and the overdamped dynamics of the nonlinear Helmholtz oscillator with a fractional order damping. For that purpose, we use the Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivative algorithm in order to get the numerical simulations. Here, we investigate the effect of taking the fractional derivative in the dissipative term in function of the parameter a. Our main findings show that the trajectories can remain inside the well or can escape from it depending on a which plays the role of a control parameter. Besides, the parameter a is also relevant for the creation or destruction of chaotic motions. On the other hand, the study of the escape times of the particles from the well, as a result of variations of the initial conditions and the undergoing force F, is reported by the use of visualization techniques such as basins of attraction and bifurcation diagrams, showing a good agreement with previous results. Finally, the study of the escape times versus the fractional parameter a shows an exponential decay which goes to zero when a is larger than one. All the results have been carried out for weak damping where chaotic motions can take place in the non-fractional case and also for a stronger damping (overdamped case), where the influence of the fractional term plays a crucial role to enhance chaotic motions. We expect that these results can be of interest in the field of fractional calculus and its applications.</description>

      <title>Vision-based Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics for 3D Moving Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations has kindled significant interests in many science and engineering areas. Existing studies primarily focus on uncovering equations that govern nonlinear dynamics based on direct measurement of the system states (e.g., trajectories). Limited efforts have been placed on distilling governing laws of dynamics directly from videos for moving targets in a 3D space. To this end, we propose a vision-based approach to automatically uncover governing equations of nonlinear dynamics for 3D moving targets via raw videos recorded by a set of cameras. The approach is composed of three key blocks: (1) a target tracking module that extracts plane pixel motions of the moving target in each video, (2) a Rodrigues' rotation formula-based coordinate transformation learning module that reconstructs the 3D coordinates with respect to a predefined reference point, and (3) a spline-enhanced library-based sparse regressor that uncovers the underlying governing law of dynamics. This framework is capable of effectively handling the challenges associated with measurement data, e.g., noise in the video, imprecise tracking of the target that causes data missing, etc. The efficacy of our method has been demonstrated through multiple sets of synthetic videos considering different nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>DIRESA, a distance-preserving nonlinear dimension reduction technique based on regularized autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In meteorology, finding similar weather patterns or analogs in historical datasets can be useful for data assimilation, forecasting, and postprocessing. In climate science, analogs in historical and climate projection data are used for attribution and impact studies. However, most of the time, those large weather and climate datasets are nearline. They must be downloaded, which takes a lot of bandwidth and disk space, before the computationally expensive search can be executed. We propose a dimension reduction technique based on autoencoder (AE) neural networks to compress those datasets and perform the search in an interpretable, compressed latent space. A distance-regularized Siamese twin autoencoder (DIRESA) architecture is designed to preserve distance in latent space while capturing the nonlinearities in the datasets. Using conceptual climate models of different complexities, we show that the latent components thus obtained provide physical insight into the dominant modes of variability in the system. Compressing datasets with DIRESA reduces the online storage and keeps the latent components uncorrelated, while the distance (ordering) preservation and reconstruction fidelity robustly outperform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other dimension reduction techniques such as UMAP or variational autoencoders.</description>

      <title>The Role of Normal and Non-Normal Contributions to Enstrophy Production in the Near-Wall Region of a Turbulent Channel Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The turbulent boundary-layer is a region where both preferential dissipation of energy and the production of significant vorticity arises as a consequence of the strong velocity gradients. Previous work has shown that, following a Reynolds decomposition of the enstrophy production, the purely fluctuating contribution is the dominant term and that near the wall this varies in a complex manner with height. In this study we additionally decompose the strain rate and vorticity terms into normal and non-normal components using a Schur decomposition and are able to explain all these features in terms of contributions at different heights from constituents involving different combinations of normal and non-normal quantities. What is surprising about our results is that while the mean shear and the action of larger scale structures should mean that non-normal effects are of over-riding importance, the most important individual term involves the fluctuating, normal straining in the transverse direction. Furthermore, the reason that the term that involves only non-normal contributions is smaller on average than that involving normal straining coupled to non-normal vorticity is that in the former case there are individual constituents that are negative in the mean. Hence, we not only explain the nature of near-wall enstrophy production in greater detail, but highlight how local straining that is orthogonal to the direction of the dominant mean and fluctuating shear plays a crucial role in amplifying vorticity that is yet to have developed sufficiently to gain a solid body rotational component.</description>

      <title>Transition to anomalous dynamics in a simple random map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Bernoulli shift (or dyadic transformation) is perhaps the simplest deterministic dynamical system exhibiting chaotic dynamics. It is a piecewise linear time-discrete map on the unit interval with a uniform slope larger than one, hence expanding, with a positive Lyapunov exponent and a uniform invariant density. If the slope is less than one the map becomes contracting, the Lyapunov exponent is negative, and the density trivially collapses onto a fixed point. Sampling from these two different types of maps at each time step by randomly selecting the expanding one with probability $p$, and the contracting one with probability $1-p$, gives a prototype of a random dynamical system. Here we calculate the invariant density of this simple random map, as well as its position autocorrelation function, analytically and numerically under variation of $p$. We find that the map exhibits a non-trivial transition from fully chaotic to completely regular dynamics by generating a long-time anomalous dynamics at a critical sampling probability $p_c$, defined by a zero Lyapunov exponent. This anomalous dynamics is characterised by an infinite invariant density, weak ergodicity breaking and power law correlation decay.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Class Fluctuation Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trajectory Class Fluctuation Theorem (TCFT) substantially strengthens the Second Law of Thermodynamics -- that, in point of fact, can be a rather weak bound on resource fluxes. Practically, it improves empirical estimates of free energies, a task known to be statistically challenging, and has diagnosed successful and failed information processing in experimentally-implemented Josephson-junction information engines. The development here justifies that empirical analysis, explicating its mathematical foundations.
  The TCFT reveals the thermodynamics induced by macroscopic system transformations for each measurable subset of system trajectories. In this, it directly combats the statistical challenge of extremely rare events that dominate thermodynamic calculations. And, it reveals new forms of free energy -- forms that can be solved for analytically and practically estimated. Conceptually, the TCFT unifies a host of previously-established fluctuation theorems, interpolating from Crooks' Detailed Fluctuation Theorem (single trajectories) to Jarzynski's Equality (trajectory ensembles).</description>

      <title>Synthetic Lagrangian Turbulence by Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian turbulence lies at the core of numerous applied and fundamental problems related to the physics of dispersion and mixing in engineering, bio-fluids, atmosphere, oceans, and astrophysics. Despite exceptional theoretical, numerical, and experimental efforts conducted over the past thirty years, no existing models are capable of faithfully reproducing statistical and topological properties exhibited by particle trajectories in turbulence. We propose a machine learning approach, based on a state-of-the-art diffusion model, to generate single-particle trajectories in three-dimensional turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, thereby bypassing the need for direct numerical simulations or experiments to obtain reliable Lagrangian data. Our model demonstrates the ability to reproduce most statistical benchmarks across time scales, including the fat-tail distribution for velocity increments, the anomalous power law, and the increased intermittency around the dissipative scale. Slight deviations are observed below the dissipative scale, particularly in the acceleration and flatness statistics. Surprisingly, the model exhibits strong generalizability for extreme events, producing events of higher intensity and rarity that still match the realistic statistics. This paves the way for producing synthetic high-quality datasets for pre-training various downstream applications of Lagrangian turbulence.</description>

      <title>Dynamic learning of synchronization in coupled nonlinear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena are pervasive in coupled nonlinear systems across the natural world and engineering domains. Understanding how to dynamically identify the parameter space (or network structure) of coupled nonlinear systems in a synchronized state is crucial for the study of system synchronization. To address the challenge of achieving stable synchronization in coupled nonlinear systems, we develop a set of mathematical optimization techniques for dynamic learning of synchronization (DLS) inspired by machine learning. This technology captures the state differences between nodes within the system and dynamically adjusts weights, allowing coupled nonlinear systems to maintain a stable state of synchronization after appropriate weight adjustments. We introduce several variants of the DLS technique, including adaptive, supervised, and hybrid methods, effectively promoting synchronization in heterogeneous networks such as small-world, scale-free, and random networks. The efficacy of this technique is validated through its application to simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neural networks and complex Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks, examining its impact on both global and local synchronization. The DLS technique proposed in this study offers a new solution to synchronization problems in dynamic network environments, addressing the deficiencies in adaptability and flexibility of existing technologies and providing a fresh perspective for understanding and implementing synchronization phenomena in coupled nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Optical next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks with internal dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises its physical openness, posing challenges for neuromorphic realizations. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with large-scale computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delayed inputs. Much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, we show that the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and large-scale Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, increased interpretability and fewer hyperparameters compared to conventional optical RC, while achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Given its scalability and versatility, our optical NGRC framework also paves the way for other next generation physical reservoirs, new applications and architectures in a broad sense.</description>
