      <title>On the ambiguity of solutions of the system of the Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work, that is devoted to the memory of Dr. Andrew Chubykalo and his legacy, is the improved version of the paper published in Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie journal.
  In this article, methods for solving the Maxwell equations are analyzed. First, a method based on the direct differentiation of Maxwell's equations and their reduction to the wave equation for an electric field is considered in detail. It is shown that this method cannot give a closed-form solution that does not contain integrals.
  The other method, which is most often used by scientists, is based on the introduction of auxiliary quantities such as electromagnetic potentials. But rewriting the Maxwell equations via potentials requires the introduction of an additional constraint - the gauge condition. Some analysis of the expressions for the electric field obtained in two gauges, Coulomb and Lorenz gauges, shows that, contrary to the generally accepted opinion that expressions for the electromagnetic field should be identical in any gauge, the final expressions for the electric field differ in different gauges. Consequently, the uniqueness of the solution of the Maxwell equations is absent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics in an Electrolyte Medium Driving Entanglement Between Graphene Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum entanglement phenomenon was demonstrated to operate on a bipartite entangled system composed of two single layers of graphene embedded in an electrolytic medium (which did not permit the transport of electrons) and subjected to an external time-dependent electric perturbation driven by a potentiostat equipped with a frequency response analyser. Time-dependent perturbation-mediating entanglement was hypothesised because of the equivalent quantum resistive-capacitive circuit frequency of each single-layer graphene system that obeys quantum electrodynamics principles. \textit{De facto}, quantum electrodynamics, associated with the massless fermionic characteristics in graphene sheets, was observed at room temperature and electrolyte medium under a time-dependent modulation, and the entanglement between the two sheets is consistent with a Hilbertian subspace mathematical examination of the phenomenon. Remarkably, this experiment, among numerous other quantum electrochemical experiments conducted by this research group that follow quantum electrodynamics principles, highlights the generality of the methodology for studying entanglement phenomena, leading to alternative methods for investigating Weyl semi-metal structures and designing room-temperature quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal mass creation by metricized accelerations in Euclidean matterspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic four-acceleration in metrically organized motions can introduce the nonlocal mechanism for the local generation of active and reactive mass densities in the monistic geometrodynamics of correlated matterspace. Four Hilbert variations for geometrized matterspace with Euclidean subgeometry maintain the universal equivalence of active and reactive mass densities. The vector counterbalance in the contracted Bianchi identities with the acceleration-based curvatures prevents the gravitational collapse of non-local self-organizations.</description>
