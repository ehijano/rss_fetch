      <title>Generalized Maximum Entropy: When and Why you need it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Maximum-Entropy Principle (MEP) based on Shannon entropy is widely used to construct least-biased probability distributions from partial information. However, the Shore-Johnson axioms that single out the Shannon functional hinge on strong system independence, an assumption often violated in real-world, strongly correlated systems. We provide a self-contained guide to when and why practitioners should abandon the Shannon form in favour of the one-parameter Uffink-Jizba-Korbel (UJK) family of generalized entropies. After reviewing the Shore and Johnson axioms from an applied perspective, we recall the most commonly used entropy functionals and locate them within the UJK family. The need for generalized entropies is made clear with two applications, one rooted in economics and the other in ecology. A simple mathematical model worked out in detail shows the power of generalized maximum entropy approaches in dealing with cases where strong system independence does not hold. We conclude with practical guidelines for choosing an entropy measure and reporting results so that analyses remain transparent and reproducible.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Quantum Internet Using Complex Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication is a growing area of research, with quantum internet being one of the most promising applications. Studying the statistical properties of this network is essential to understanding its connectivity and the efficiency of the entanglement distribution. However, the models proposed in the literature often assume homogeneous distributions in the connections of the optical fiber infrastructure, without considering the heterogeneity of the network. In this work, we propose new models for the quantum internet that incorporate this heterogeneity of node connections in the optical fiber network, analyzing how this characteristic influences fundamental metrics such as the degree distribution, the average clustering coefficient, the average shortest path and assortativity. Our results indicate that, compared to homogeneous models, heterogeneous networks efficiently reproduce key structural properties of real optical fiber networks, including degree distribution, assortativity, and hierarchical behavior. These findings highlight the impact of network structure on quantum communication and can contribute to more realistic modeling of quantum internet infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Information theory for hypergraph similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing networks is essential for a number of downstream tasks, from clustering to anomaly detection. Despite higher-order interactions being critical for understanding the dynamics of complex systems, traditional approaches for network comparison are limited to pairwise interactions only. Here we construct a general information theoretic framework for hypergraph similarity, capturing meaningful correspondence among higher-order interactions while correcting for spurious correlations. Our method operationalizes any notion of structural overlap among hypergraphs as a principled normalized mutual information measure, allowing us to derive a hierarchy of increasingly granular formulations of similarity among hypergraphs within and across orders of interactions, and at multiple scales. We validate these measures through extensive experiments on synthetic hypergraphs and apply the framework to reveal meaningful patterns in a variety of empirical higher-order networks. Our work provides foundational tools for the principled comparison of higher-order networks, shedding light on the structural organization of networked systems with non-dyadic interactions.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture, at once, dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability. This paper is complemented by a GitHub repository at https://github.com/FlaGer99/SLR-Spatio-Temporal-GNN.git providing additional interactive tools to further explore the presented findings.</description>
