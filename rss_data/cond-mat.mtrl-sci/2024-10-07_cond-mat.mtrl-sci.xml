      <title>Postmortem analysis and possible rebirth of LK-99</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LK-99 hype came and went but the great potential of the apatite class of materials as platform for flat bands research must not be swept away in the process. A heuristic reinterpretation of the atomic structure of LK-99 is offered, including electronic signatures from the fully oxidized to the fully reduced. Here, copper is proposed to reside in the apatite channel rather than doping the Lead sublattice. Contact is made with the experimental x-ray powder diffractogram. The electronic signatures are found to reflect those of local [O-Cu-O] and [O-Cu-Vo**] molecular ions, where Vo** is a 2+ charged vacant oxygen site in the apatite channel. The local nature warrants flat bands. Charge carrier concentration is controlled by the oxygen content. Fully reduced LK-99 is a wide band gap insulator with a well-developed intermediate band. Fully oxidized LK-99 is a magnetic insulator, while the partially reduced LK-99 allows for hopping of holes between anti bonding pi orbitals of non-magnetic and magnetic [O-Cu-O] moieties. The findings are extended to include the case where half of the Cu atoms are replaced by Ni and half by Zn. For [O-Ni-O] +[O-Zn-Vo**] inter-site accidental near degeneracy among states at EF is reported, while for [O-Zn-O] + [O-Ni-Vo**] the near-degeneracy at EF on hole doping is among intra-site valence states exclusively on [O-Ni-Vo**]. The apatite platform is ideal for the study of flat bands associated phenomena. The reinterpreted fully reduced LK-99 system invites intrinsic intermediate band solar cells applications. Sites with variable oxygen occupation allow for holes doping, the consequences of which include strong correlations between electrons and lattice that suggest the emergence of (rebuilt) phonons mediated intra- as well as inter- bands (virtual) electron transfer-based phenomena, feeding the quest for ambient conditions superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Triplet Exciton Sensitization of Silicon Mediated by Defect States in Hafnium Oxynitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singlet exciton fission has the potential to increase the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells beyond the conventional single junction limit. Perhaps the largest obstacle to achieving this enhancement is uncertainty about energy coupling mechanisms at the interfaces between silicon and exciton fission materials such as tetracene. Here, the previously reported silicon-hafnium oxynitride-tetracene structure is studied and a combination of magnetic-field-dependent silicon photoluminescence measurements and density functional theory calculations is used to probe the influence of the interlayer composition on the triplet transfer process across the hafnium oxynitride interlayer. It is found that hafnium oxide interlayers do not show triplet exciton sensitization of silicon, and that nitrogen content in hafnium oxynitride layers is correlated with enhanced sensitization. Calculation results reveal that defects in hafnium oxynitride interlayers with higher nitrogen content introduce states close to the band-edge of silicon, which can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process. Some defects introduce additional deleterious mid-gap states, which may explain observed silicon photoluminescence quenching. These results show that band-edge states can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process, potentially through a sequential charge transfer mechanism.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of the energetics and the local chemical ordering of tungsten-based alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten (W) is considered a leading candidate for structural and functional materials in future fusion energy devices. The most attractive properties of tungsten for magnetic and inertial fusion energy reactors are its high melting point, high thermal conductivity, low sputtering yield, and low long-term disposal radioactive footprint. However, tungsten also presents a very low fracture toughness, primarily associated with inter-granular failure and bulk plasticity, limiting its applications. In recent years, several families of tungsten-based alloys have been explored to overcome the aforementioned limitations of pure tungsten. These might include tungsten-based high-entropy alloys (W-HEAs) and the so-called tungsten-based \textquote{smart alloys}. In this work, we present a computational approach that uses first-principles DFT electronic structure calculations to understand the effect of the chemical environment on tungsten-based alloys. In particular, we compared the Special Quasi-random Structure (SQS) and the DFT-coupled Monte Carlo (MC-DFT) methods when investigating the short-range order and elastic properties of two equimolar WCrTaTi and WVTaTi W-HEAs, and two WCrTi and WCrY W-SAs. We found that structures after MC-DFT calculation have lower cohesive energies than SQS structures, with shorter lattice constants, and large elastic properties values. Furthermore, distinct element segregation was studied by calculating the SRO parameter and radius distribution function. The total density of states suggested that the existence of SRO could improve the stability of the structure.</description>

      <title>An atomic-scale view at Fe4N as hydrogen barrier material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen, while a promising sustainable energy carrier, presents challenges such as the embrittlement of materials due to its ability to penetrate and weaken their crystal structures. Here we investigate Fe4N nitride layers, formed on iron through a cost-effective gas nitriding process, as an effective hydrogen permeation barrier. A combination of screening using advanced characterization, density functional theory calculations, and hydrogen permeation analysis reveals that a nitride layer reduces hydrogen diffusion by a factor of 20 at room temperature. This reduction is achieved by creating energetically unfavorable states due to stronger H-binding at the surface and high energy barriers for diffusion. The findings demonstrate the potential of Fe4N as a cost-efficient and easy-to-process solution to protecting metallic materials exposed to hydrogen, with great advantages for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic cloaking: concealing a region from diffusive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel class of cloaking in which a region of space is concealed from an ensemble of diffusing particles whose individual trajectories are governed by a stochastic (Langevin) equation. In particular, we simulate how different interpretations of the Langevin equation affect the cloaking performance of an annular single-layer invisibility cloak of smoothly varying diffusivity in two dimensions. Near-perfect cloaking is achieved under the Ito convention, indicated by the cloak preventing particles from accessing an inner core while simultaneously preserving the particle density outside the cloak relative to simulations involving no protected region (and no cloak). Even better cloaking performance can be achieved by regularising the singular behaviour of the cloak -- which we demonstrate through two different approaches. These results establish the foundations of ``stochastic cloaking'', which we believe to be a significant milestone following that of optical and thermal cloaking.</description>

      <title>Determining local mobility variation along recrystallization boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding recrystallization boundary migration mechanisms is crucial for materials design. However, the lack of comprehensive mobility data for high-angle grain boundaries in typical polycrystalline samples has impeded gaining insights into the factors that govern boundary migration. In this work, we develop a fitting methodology to determine mobility values for individual recrystallization boundaries in partially recrystallized samples. This methodology involves optimizing mobility inputs in a phase field model by aligning simulated microstructure with time-series recrystallization experiments. We first validate this method on synthetic data and then apply it to real experimental data. For the first time, we reveal a three-order-magnitude variation in local mobility along individual recrystallization boundaries. Additionally, we provide detailed analytical and computational analyses to explore the effect of this local mobility variation on boundary migration. The results show that mobility variation significantly influences boundary dynamics, shedding light on the interplay of factors that impact the observed boundary migration behavior. This methodology offers a new framework for interpreting experimental recrystallization behavior and can be broadly applied to other materials using in situ experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of Biaxial Strain on Cation Octahedral Rotations and the Electronic Band Structure of the Antiperovskite Mn$_{3}$GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory is used to study the effect of compressive and tensile biaxial strain on Mn$_{3}$GaN. Mn$_{3}$GaN is a non-collinear antiferromagnetic antiperovskite with a similar structure to that of an ideal cubic oxide perovskite, but with cations at the octahedral sites while the anion, nitrogen, is found at the B site. The present study explores the response of Mn$_{3}$GaN to (001) strain, considering biaxial strain levels ranging from -5\% to 5\%. It is found that the electron structure is insensitive to tensile strain. The study supports previous results in that a spin-canted antiferromagnetic order emerges due to tensile strain, inducing net magnetization. Compressive strain collapses the non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin structure and induces a ferrimagnetic order at -2\% strain. Notably, in contrast with oxide perovskites, Mn$_{3}$GaN does not respond to strain by octahedral tilt, but rather by intraband redistributions of charge between Mn $d$ states. Despite the similar structure to oxide perovskites, the bonds between the B site anion and octahedral site cations in Mn$_{3}$GaN bonds are less rigid, such that strain is instead accommodated by a change in bond length rather than a change in bond angles.</description>

      <title>Growth of compositionally uniform $\mathrm{In}_{x}\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\mathrm{N}$ layers with low relaxation degree on GaN by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 500-nm-thick $\mathrm{In}_{x}\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\mathrm{N}$ layers with $x=$ 0.05-0.14 are grown using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy, and their properties are assessed by a comprehensive analysis involving x-ray diffraction, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and cathodoluminescence as well as photoluminescence spectroscopy. We demonstrate low degrees of strain relaxation (10% for $x=0.12$), low threading dislocation densities ($\mathrm{1\times10^{9}\,cm^{-2}}$ for $x=0.12$), uniform composition both in the growth and lateral direction, and a narrow emission band. The unique sum of excellent materials properties make these layers an attractive basis for the top-down fabrication of ternary nanowires.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Gaussian Process-Based Bayesian Optimization for Materials Discovery in High Entropy Alloy Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful and data-efficient method for iterative materials discovery and design, particularly valuable when prior knowledge is limited, underlying functional relationships are complex or unknown, and the cost of querying the materials space is significant. Traditional BO methodologies typically utilize conventional Gaussian Processes (cGPs) to model the relationships between material inputs and properties, as well as correlations within the input space. However, cGP-BO approaches often fall short in multi-objective optimization scenarios, where they are unable to fully exploit correlations between distinct material properties. Leveraging these correlations can significantly enhance the discovery process, as information about one property can inform and improve predictions about others. This study addresses this limitation by employing advanced kernel structures to capture and model multi-dimensional property correlations through multi-task (MTGPs) or deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs), thus accelerating the discovery process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MTGP-BO and DGP-BO in rapidly and robustly solving complex materials design challenges that occur within the context of complex multi-objective optimization -- carried out by leveraging the pyiron workflow manager over FCC FeCrNiCoCu high entropy alloy (HEA) spaces, where traditional cGP-BO approaches fail. Furthermore, we highlight how the differential costs associated with querying various material properties can be strategically leveraged to make the materials discovery process more cost-efficient.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Comment on "Reconsidering the nonlinear emergent inductance: time-varying Joule heating and its impact on the AC electrical response""</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We respond to the "Comment on "Reconsidering the nonlinear emergent inductance: time-varying Joule heating and its impact on the AC electrical response"", submitted by Yokouchi et al. (arXiv:2407.15682), which refers to our preprint by Furuta et al (arXiv:2407.00309). In our preprint, we argued that the nonlinear impedance reported for materials with noncollinear magnetic textures, Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$, YMn$_6$Sn$_6$, and FeSn$_2$, can be attributed to the considerable contribution of Joule-heating-induced AC electrical response, rather than the emergent electric field (EEF) due to the current-induced-dynamics of magnetic textures. In the comment by Yokouchi et al., the authors presented new data and concluded that the nonlinear impedance previously reported for Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ and YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ was not due to Joule heating but to the EEF. After reviewing their data and arguments, we found that (i) they misunderstood the applicability of the Joule heating model discussed in our preprint (arXiv:2407.00309), (ii) the data they presented in the comment are affected by extrinsic superconductivity caused during the microfabrication of specimens using focused ion beam (FIB) methods, and (iii) they misinterpreted their new data regarding the magnetic-field-angle dependence of the nonlinear impedance. Thus, we maintain that the nonlinear impedance reported in the literature and the comment includes a considerable impact from Joule heating. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$, the cross-sectional area dependence of the nonlinear impedance refutes the EEF scenario, and that the sign change of nonlinear resistance observed by Yokouchi \textit{et al.}~is not allowed from the perspective of stability associated with the current-driven EEF.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Algebra Made Simple for Thermoelectric Generator Module Performance Prediction under Constant Seebeck-Coefficient Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While thermoelectric material performances can be estimated using the ZT, predicting the performance of thermoelectric generator modules (TGMs) is complex due to the non-linearity and non-locality of the thermoelectric differential equations. Here, we present a simplified thermoelectric algebra framework for predicting TGM performance within the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA). First, we revisit the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Model (CSM) to transform the differential equations into exact algebraic equations for thermoelectric heat flux and conversion efficiency in terms of the load resistance ratio and relative Fourier heat flux. Next, we introduce the CSA, where the Thomson term is neglected, and the device parameters are assumed to be fixed. We define average thermoelectric properties and device parameters at the zero-current condition using a simple temperature integral. Finally, we derive approximate thermoelectric algebraic equations for voltage, resistance, heat flux, and conversion efficiency as functions of current. We numerically validate that the CSA formalism is superior to other single-parameter theories, such as peak-ZT, integral-ZT, and the generic engineering-ZT, in predicting efficiency. The relative standard error in optimal efficiency is less than 11% for average ZT values not exceeding 2. By combining CSM and CSA, TGM performance can be easily estimated without the need for calculus or solving differential equations.</description>

      <title>Ferro-ionic States and Domains Morphology in Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unique polar properties of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia oxides (Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$) are of great interest for condensed matter physics, nanophysics and advanced applications. These properties are connected (at least partially) to the ionic-electronic and electrochemical phenomena at the hafnia surface, interfaces and/or internal grain boundaries. Here we calculated the phase diagrams, dielectric permittivity, spontaneous polar and antipolar ordering, and domain structure morphology in Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ nanoparticles covered by ionic-electronic charge, originated from the surface electrochemical adsorption. We revealed that the ferro-ionic coupling supports the polar long-range order in the nanoscale Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$, induces and/or enlarges the stability region of the labyrinthine domains towards smaller sizes and smaller environmental dielectric constant at low concentrations of the surface ions, and causes the transition to the single-domain ferro-ionic state at high concentrations of the surface ions. We predict that the labyrinthine domain states, being multiple-degenerated, may significantly affect the emergence of the negative differential capacitance state in the nanograined/nanocrystalline Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ films.</description>

      <title>Phase-field thermo-electromechanical modelling of lead-free BNT-based piezoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent yerars, Bismuth sodium titanate (BNT) and BNT-based piezoelectric materials have proved potential for lead-free piezoelectric technologies. Such materials' complicated phase structure is crucial to their thermo-electromechanical behaviour. Pure BNT has a rhombohedral (R3c) lattice structure at room temperature. The phase transition to an orthorhombic phase (Pnma) at 200\textcelsius is mainly due to octahedral tilting. This transition is called the depolarization temperature ($T_{d}$). The R3c phase ferroelectric domains have a higher spontaneous polarization, which declines with increasing temperature and reaches a local minimum at $T_{d}$, causing a phase change. Additionally, BNT transitions from Pnma to P4bm at 320\textcelsius and from P4bm to Pm3m at 520\textcelsius. These transitions also result in the changes in the spontaneous polarization. Therefore, the investigation of domain switching and phase change dynamics in relation to temperature and electromechanical coupling has acquired considerable importance. The complex phase regimes and their activation under different temperature settings will be examined to improve the use of these materials in sensors, actuators, energy harvesting devices, and haptic technologies. The micro-sized BNT inclusions are implanted in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to reperesent the practical scenario. A two-dimensional phase-field thermo-electromechanical computational model has been created to investigate the complex phase transition and domain switching behaviour of BNT-PDMS composite under varying temperature conditions. The model uses Landau-Ginzburg and thermo-electromechanical free energy to accurately simulate phase shift and domain switching. Data from pure BNT experiments validated the model. It can predict thermo-electromechanical response in different phase regimes and temperature-induced phase coexistence.</description>

      <title>Spotting structural defects in crystals from the topology of vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the inevitably disordered background, structural defects are not well-defined concepts in amorphous solids. In order to overcome this difficulty, it has been recently proposed that topological defects can be still identified in the pattern of vibrational modes, by looking at the corresponding eigenvector field at low frequency. Moreover, it has been verified that these defects strongly correlate with the location of soft spots in glasses, that are the regions more prone to plastic rearrangements. Here, we show that the topology of vibrational modes predicts the location of structural defects in crystals as well, including the cases of dislocations, disclinations and Eshelby inclusions. Our results suggest that in crystalline solids topological defects in the vibrational modes are directly connected to the well-established structural defects governing plastic deformations and present characteristics very similar to those observed in amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Chemical Orders in Formation of Striped Patterns in Metamorphic Rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The striped patterns in rocks, characterized by thin dark bands and thick light bands, are a result of the natural processes that have shaped the rocks through in situ metamorphism. Notably, the dark and light bands are composed of similar minerals, with the dark bands containing additional trapped materials such as fluid pockets or extra mineral grains. Here we employed the Gray-Scott Reaction Diffusion model to investigate the interaction between two sets of virtual chemicals, denoted as 'u' and 'v'. The differing diffusion and reaction rates of 'u' and 'v' chemical orders lead to the formation of 180 degree out-of-phase chemical domains, resulting in striped patterns. Utilizing the Gray-Scott model in this manner, we gain valuable insights into the early microscopic stages of these geologically significant striped patterns in metamorphic rocks.</description>

      <title>Molecular topological deep learning for polymer property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of polymer properties is of key importance for polymer design. Traditional experimental tools and density function theory (DFT)-based simulations for polymer property evaluation, are both expensive and time-consuming. Recently, a gigantic amount of graph-based molecular models have emerged and demonstrated huge potential in molecular data analysis. Even with the great progresses, these models tend to ignore the high-order and mutliscale information within the data. In this paper, we develop molecular topological deep learning (Mol-TDL) for polymer property analysis. Our Mol-TDL incorporates both high-order interactions and multiscale properties into topological deep learning architecture. The key idea is to represent polymer molecules as a series of simplicial complices at different scales and build up simplical neural networks accordingly. The aggregated information from different scales provides a more accurate prediction of polymer molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Activation entropy of dislocation glide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that the entropy of activation associated with dislocation glide, a process controlling body-centered cubic metals strength, is either constant or related to the enthalpy and stress through the empirical Meyer-Neldel (MN) law. We present an atomistic investigation revealing that while both cases can be encountered depending on the refinement of simulation methodology, the MN law for this process is an artifact of simple radial models of interatomic interaction which predict a rugged energy landscape, and is not necessarily connected to the temperature-evolution of the bulk modulus as historically thought. Comparing a classical and a dedicated machine-learning (ML) interatomic potential, we show surprisingly large differences between the classical harmonic theory and anharmonic calculations with the classical model, impacting dislocation velocities by orders of magnitude, while both predictions are in excellent agreement using the ML, which predicts a constant activation entropy. Simulations based on classical potentials, a cornerstone of materials modelling, could be broadly affected by these over-estimated entropic effects.</description>

      <title>Observation of converse flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Tuning of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Bi-substituted yttrium iron garnet films by He$^+$ ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the continuous tuning of magnetic anisotropy in perpendicularly magnetized bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Bi-YIG) films via He$^+$ ion irradiation. Our findings indicate that the magnetization direction of epitaxial Bi-YIG films on sGGG substrates transitions from out-of-plane in the as-grown state to in-plane after He+ ion irradiation at a fluence exceeding $2\times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$. The reorientation is attributed to the relaxation of tensile film strain, which reduces the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy without affecting the saturation magnetization. The Gilbert damping parameter and the inhomogeneous broadening of the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth show only minimal increases with ion irradiation. Additionally, at a fluence of $5\times 10^{13}$ ions/cm$^2$, we observe the formation of magnetic bubble domains in the Bi-YIG films. Micromagnetic simulations estimate a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction of 0.006 mJ/m$^2$, which is insufficient for stabilizing N\'eel-type skyrmions. Finally, we demonstrate that the effects of He$^+$ ion irradiation can be largely reversed through thermal annealing in an oxygen atmosphere.</description>

      <title>The initial stages of silver fluorination: a scanning tunneling microscopy investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM) to characterize the early stages of silver fluorination. On Ag(100), we observe only one adsorbate species, which shows a bias-dependent STM topography. Notably, at negative bias voltages, $V_{\rm B}&lt;0$, the apparent shape can be described as a round protrusion surrounded by a moat-like depression (sombrero). As the voltage increases, the apparent shape changes, eventually evolving into a round depression. From the STM images, we determine the adsorption site to be the hollow position. On Ag(110) we find adsorbates with three distinct STM topographies. One type exhibits the same shape change with $V_{\rm B}$ as observed on Ag(100), that is, from a sombrero shape to a round depression as the voltage changes from negative to positive values; the other two types are observed as round depressions regardless of $V_{\rm B}$. From the STM images, we find the three adsorbates to be sitting on the short-bridge, hollow and top position on the Ag(110) surface, with a relative abundance of 60\%, 35\% and 5\%.</description>

      <title>High temperature and pressure thermoelasticity of hcp metals from ab initio quasi-harmonic free energy calculations: the beryllium case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic ab initio study of the temperature and pressure dependent thermoelastic properties of hcp beryllium within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). The accuracy of the Zero Static Internal Stress Approximation (ZSISA) and of the volume-constrained ZSISA that are widely applied in ab initio thermodynamic calculations are quantified. Particularly, the effect of ZSISA for the calculation of $C_{11}$ and $C_{12}$ is compared with a novel numerical approach which minimizes the free energy with respect to the atomic positions at each strain. In beryllium, minor deviations are found within ZSISA, which gives ECs in good agreement with the full free energy minimization (FFEM). A substantial difference is found between QHA and the quasi-static approximation (QSA), with the former closer to experiments. Within QSA, we compare the ECs obtained by interpolating from a set of geometries along the "stress-pressure" isotherm at $0$ K (within V-ZSISA) with a more general interpolation on a two-dimensional grid of crystal parameters which allows the calculation of the ECs along the $0$ kbar isobar. This paper provides a practical approach for the investigation of the thermoelastic properties of hcp metals at extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Nanoconfined Water Phase Transitions in Infinite Graphene Slits: Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Mean-Field Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental and computational studies have demonstrated that nanoconfinement profoundly alters the phase behavior of water, facilitating complex phase transitions at pressures and temperatures far lower than typically observed in bulk systems. When combined with adsorption, nanoconfinement substantially enhances water uptake, primarily due to condensation occurring at the onset of the isotherm curve-a phenomenon intimately related to the facilitated formation of hydrogen bond networks. In this study, we adopt a dual approach to investigate water confined within infinite graphene slits. Our Molecular Dynamics simulations reveal hysteresis across all investigated temperatures. Unlike in finite slits, where hysteresis arises due to surface tension effects at the edges, in the case of infinite slits, the hysteresis is the result of a genuine phase transition at the nanoscale. We analyze the spatial and orientational arrangements of the water molecules, demonstrating how the graphene surface promotes the formation of a hydrogen bond network in the adjacent water layers. The remarkably low pressure required for water uptake in this nano-environment is explained at the mean-field level using a simple interacting lattice model. This is attributed to the exponential dependence of the critical pressure on the adsorbate-adsorbent interaction.</description>

      <title>Influence of the microstructure on the mechanical behavior of nanoporous materials under large strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous materials are characterized by their complex porous morphology illustrated by the presence of a solid network and voids. The fraction of these voids is characterized by the porosity of the structure, which influences the bulk mechanical properties of the material. Most literature on the mechanics of porous materials has focused on the density-dependence of their elastic properties. In addition to porosity, other pore characteristics, namely pore-size and shape described by the pore-size distribution, and pore-wall size and shape, also influence the bulk response of these materials. In this work, the mechanical structure-property relation of nanoporous materials is studied under large deformations using a computational framework. The interdependent microstructural parameters are identified. After a successful correlation between the synthesis and microstructural parameters, the synthesis of porous materials can be guided and optimized by controlling these parameters.</description>

      <title>Formation of Anisotropic Polarons in Antimony Selenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimony Selenide (Sb$_2$Se$_3$) is an attractive candidate of photovoltaics with not yet satisfying efficiency. Beside defects, polaron formation originated from lattice distortion was proposed to account for trapping free carriers, and the subsequent photoexcitation dynamics and optoelectronic properties, but such a mechanism is still lack of structural observations. Here we directly track the pathways of carrier and lattice evolutions after photoexcitation through optical and electron diffraction pump-probe methods, revealing the temporal correlations between dynamics of both degrees of freedom. The observed opposite separation changes of Se2-Sb2 and Sb2-Sb1 atom pairs in a few picoseconds, and the intermediate state induced by local structural distortions lasting several tens of picoseconds, coinciding with the optical phonons population and coupling, and the trapping process of carriers, respectively, together with the analyses of modulation on diffuse scattering by the atomic displacement fields of polaron model, indicate the formation of anisotropic polarons with large size. Our findings provide carrier and structural information for helping the elucidation of polaron scenario in Sb2Se3, and probably in materials with anisotropic structure and soft lattice which are popular in developing novel optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Emissive Surface Traps Lead to Asymmetric Photoluminescence Line Shape in Spheroidal CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of quantum dots plays an important role in governing their photophysics. Here, we explore the photoluminescence of spheroidal CsPbBr3 quantum dots synthesized via the room-temperature trioctlyphosphine oxide/PbBr2 method. Despite photoluminescence quantum yields nearing 100%, these spheroidal quantum dots exhibit an elongated red photoluminescence tail not observed in typical cubic quantum dots synthesized via hot injection. We explore this elongated red tail through structural and optical characterization including small-angle x-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy and time-resolved, steady-state, and single quantum dot photoluminescence. From these measurements we conclude that the red tail originates from emissive surface traps. We hypothesize that these emissive surface traps are located on the (111) surfaces and show that the traps can be passivated by adding phenethyl ammonium bromide, resulting in a more symmetric line shape</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extensions of the classical Debye model of susceptibility of dielectric materials to the well-known Cole-Cole, Davidson- Cole, or the Havriliak-Negami models is done by introducing non-integer power parameters to the frequency-domain function. This is very often necessary in order to account for anomalous deviations of the experimental data from the ideal case. The corresponding time-domain descriptions expressed in terms of the relaxation or response functions are in the form of first-order differential equations for the case of Debye model, but involves relatively complex integro-differential operators for the modified ones. In this work, we study the extension of the time-domain kinetic equation describing the Debye polarization function to include two extra degrees of freedom; one to transform the first-order time derivative of the polarization function to the Caputo fractional-order time derivative and another to change the linear term to a power term. From an electrical perspective, it results in a constant-phase element with two fractional parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is pivotal in revealing intricate micro- and nanoscale features across various research fields. However, obtaining high-resolution SEM images presents challenges, including prolonged scanning durations and potential sample degradation due to extended electron beam exposure. This paper addresses these challenges by training and applying a deep learning based super-resolution algorithm. We show that the chosen algorithm is capable of increasing the resolution by a factor of 4, thereby reducing the initial imaging time by a factor of 16. We benchmark our method in terms of visual similarity and similarity metrics on two different materials, a dual-phase steel and a case-hardening steel, improving over standard interpolation methods. Additionally, we introduce an experimental pipeline for the study of rare events in scanning electron micrographs, without losing high-resolution information.</description>

Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors ($Q_m$) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase $Q_m$. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from 45nm to 295nm, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below 200nm thickness exhibit the highest $Q_m\cdot f_m$-product, on the order of $10^{12}$Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher $Q_m\cdot f_m$-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of the noncentrosymmetric magnet Sr2MnSi2O7 through irreducible representation and magnetic space group analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic structures of the noncentrosymmetric magnet Sr$_2$MnSi$_2$O$_7$ were examined through neutron diffraction for powder and single-crystalline samples, as well as magnetometry measurements. All allowed magnetic structures under the space group $P\bar{4}2_1 m$ with the magnetic wavevector $\vec{q}_{\rm m}=(0,0,1/2)$~r.l.u., were analysed via irreducible representation and magnetic space group approaches. The compound is refined to have in-plane magnetic moments within the magnetic space group $Cmc2_1.1^{\prime}_c$ (\#36.177) under zero field, which can be altered to $P2_1 2_1 2_1.1^{\prime}_c$ (\#19.28) above $\mu_0 H=0.067(5)$~T to align induced weak-ferromagnetic components within one layer on the $ab$-plane. All refined parameters are provided following the recent framework based upon the magnetic space group, which better conveys when exchanging crystallographic information for commensurate magnetic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets in the presence of crystalline lattice dislocations are investigated. We show the existence of topologically protected non-propagative modes that localize at dislocations. These in-gap states, coined as {\it magnonic zero-modes}, are characterized by the $Z_2$ topological invariant that derives from parity symmetry broken induced by sublattice magnetic anisotropy. We uncover that bulk topology existing in the perfect crystal is robust under the influence of lattice defects, which is monitored by the real-space Bott index. It is also revealed that the topology of zero-modes remains unaffected when bulk topology becomes trivial and is remarkably resilient against magnetic disorder. Our findings point to the intriguing relationship between topological lattice defects and the spectrum of topological spin excitations.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent conductivity of nanometric semiconductor thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanomenters thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

Abstract: We report the synthesis of a new functional molecule, a quater-tiophene based surfactant, which can both adsorb at the water / gas interface (surface active molecule) and aggregates through pi-pi stacking interactions. We assess then the ability of this molecule to create these functionalities at interfaces. This interfacial functional aggregation, characterized here in situ for the first time, is probed thanks to Langmuir trough experiments and spectrometric ellipsometry. These results open some new routes for the design of new water based opto-electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spins in strongly frustrated systems are of intense interest due to the emergence of intriguing quantum states including superconductivity and quantum spin liquid. Herein we report the discovery of cascade of phase transitions and large magnetic anisotropy in the averievite CsClCu5P2O10 single crystals. Under zero field, CsClCu5P2O10 undergoes a first-order structural transition at around 225 K from high temperature centrosymmetric P-3m1 to low temperature noncentrosymmetric P321, followed by an AFM transition at 13.6 K, another structural transition centering at ~3 K, and another AFM transition at ~2.18 K. Based upon magnetic susceptibility and magnetization data with magnetic fields perpendicular to the ab plane, a phase diagram, consisting of a paramagnetic state, two AFM states and four field-induced states including two magnetization plateaus, has been constructed. Our findings demonstrate that the quasi-2D CsClCu5P2O10 exhibits rich structural and metamagnetic transitions and the averievite family is a fertile platform for exploring novel quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Solution-based soft matter self-assembly (SA) promises unique materials properties from approaches including additive manufacturing/three-dimensional (3D) printing. We report direct ink writing derived, hierarchically porous transition metal nitride superconductors (SCs) and precursor oxides, structure-directed by Pluronics-family block copolymer (BCP) SA and heat treated in various environments. SCs with periodic lattices on three length scales show record nanoconfinement-induced upper critical field enhancements correlated with BCP molar mass, attaining values of 50 T for NbN and 8.1 T for non-optimized TiN samples, the first mapping of a tailorable SC property onto a macromolecular parameter. They reach surface areas above 120 m$^2$/g, the highest reported for compound SCs to date. Embedded printing enables the first BCP directed mesoporous non-self-supporting helical SCs. Results suggest that additive manufacturing may open pathways to mesoporous SCs with not only a variety of macroscopic form factors but enhanced properties from intrinsic, SA-derived mesostructures with substantial academic and technological promise.</description>

      <title>Phase segregation lubricates paste extrusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extrusion is a critical process in the manufacturing of various organic materials, including animal feed, human food, pharmaceuticals, and biomass for bioenergy. During extrusion, a dense particle-fluid mixture, or paste, is pushed through a narrow channel under high pressure. Despite its widespread use, many questions remain about how particle-fluid interactions and frictional forces at the wall influence high-pressure paste flow, particularly whether laboratory-scale findings translate to more complex industrial settings. Here, we quantify for the first time how a micrometer thin fluid lubrication layer emerges from particle-fluid interactions during the extrusion of organic biomass, controlling friction at the paste-channel interface. This lubrication layer forms through a pressure-induced phase segregation process and is significantly thinner than the particle size, affecting their contact dynamics, making friction at the interface tunable. Our results reveal how the thickness of the lubrication layer is influenced by paste composition, enhancing our fundamental understanding of phase segregation during industrial extrusion processes and offering potential pathways for reducing energy consumption and product failure in the industrial material production.</description>

      <title>Focused helium ion beam nanofabrication by near-surface swelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focused helium ion beam microscope is a versatile imaging and nanofabrication instrument enabling direct-write lithography with sub-10-nm resolution. Subsurface damage and swelling of substrates due to helium ion implantation is generally unwanted. However, these effects can also be leveraged for specific nanofabrication tasks. To explore this, we investigate focused helium ion beam induced swelling of bulk crystalline silicon and free-standing amorphous silicon nitride membranes using various irradiation strategies. We show that the creation of near-surface voids due to helium ion implantation can be used to induce surface nanostructure and create subsurface nanochannels. By tailoring the ion dose and beam energy, the size and depth of the swollen features can be controlled. Swelling heights of several hundred nanometers are demonstrated and for the embedded nanochannels, void internal diameters down to 30nm are shown. Potential applications include the engineering of texturized substrates and the prototyping of on-chip nanofluidic transport devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport and attracted tremendous interest. We show that the quantum metric is only a tip of the iceberg, by deriving unknown 11 out of 14 formulas of the quadratic nonlinear conductivity under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges. The formulas allow us to determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for the magnetic point groups, calculate the quadratic nonlinear conductivity for arbitrary Hamiltonian, e.g., the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films with and without the $C_{3}$ symmetry, and formulate scaling laws at the order of quantum metric to distinguish different mechanisms in the recent experiments. The theory is a comprehensive description of the quadratic nonlinear transport and will facilitate future experiments and applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of illumination of bicircularly polarized light (BCL) on topological semimetals, namely multifold fermion and line-node semimetals. We demonstrate, by means of both low-energy and lattice models, that the band-structures of both multifold fermions and line-node semimetal exhibit rich features with BCL illumination. For multifold fermions, we show that if the relative amplitude, $r$, between the two frequency components of the BCL is related to the relative frequency, $\eta$, in such a way that $r^2 = \eta$, then the band touching points remain unchanged without any shift or band gap opening for any choice of the material-dependent parameters. For other choices of the BCL parameters, we find both gapped phases as well as gapless phases with shifted band touching points. Line-node semimetals also exhibit diverse phases, ranging from protected line-nodes under illumination to point nodes, by tuning the BCL parameters $r$ and $\eta$. Overall, our analytical and numerical results establish BCL as a versatile tool for obtaining tunable topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient ab initio framework to compute the Gibbs energy of the transition state in vacancy-mediated diffusion including the relevant thermal excitations at density-functional-theory level. With the aid of a bespoke machine-learning interatomic potential, the temperature-dependent vacancy formation and migration Gibbs energies of the prototype system body-centered cubic (BCC) tungsten are shown to be strongly affected by anharmonicity. This finding explains the physical origin of the experimentally observed non-Arrhenius behavior of tungsten self-diffusion. A remarkable agreement between the calculated and experimental temperature-dependent self-diffusivity and, in particular, its curvature is revealed. The proposed computational framework is robust and broadly applicable, as evidenced by the first tests for a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) multicomponent high-entropy alloy. The successful applications underscore the attainability of an accurate ab initio diffusion database.</description>

Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is a powerful theoretical approach that is capable to accurately treat electron-hole interactions in materials in an excited state. We developed an ab initio framework based on the BSE to describe a pump-probe experiment, in which an x-ray pulse probes solid-state valence excitons by means of x-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our theoretical framework is of relevance for an accurate modeling of pump-probe experiments of photo-excited materials that utilize novel capabilities offered by x-ray science.</description>

      <title>Transport resistance strikes back: unveiling its impact on fill factor losses in organic solar cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fill factor (FF) is a critical parameter for solar cell efficiency, but its analytical description is challenging due to the interplay between recombination and charge extraction processes. An often overlooked yet significant factor contributing to FF losses, beyond recombination, is the influence of charge transport. In most state-of-the-art organic solar cells, the primary limitations of the FF arise not just from non-radiative recombination but also from low conductivity. A closer look reveals that even in the highest efficiency cells, performance losses due to transport resistance are significant, highlighting the need for refined models to predict the FF accurately.
  Here, we extend the analytical model for transport resistance to a more general case. Drawing from a large set of experimental current-voltage and light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage data, we systematically incorporate crucial details previously omitted in the model. Consequently, we introduce a straightforward set of equations to predict the FF of a solar cell, enabling the differentiation of losses attributed to recombination and transport resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into strategies for mitigating FF losses based on the experimentally validated analytical model, guiding the development of more efficient solar cell designs and optimisation strategies.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary segregation prediction with a dual-solute model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15513v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solute segregation along grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly affects their thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors in polycrystalline materials. Recently, the spectral approach has emerged as a powerful tool to predict GB segregation. However, previous GB segregation predictions using this method relied heavily on single-solute segregation energy spectrum without solute-solute interactions, which were often incorporated through a fitting parameter. In this work, we developed a dual-solute model whose segregation energy spectrum intrinsically incorporates solute-solute interactions. It was first validated for GB segregation prediction in the Al-Mg system and then extended to several other distinct binary alloy systems. The dual-solute model shows significant improvement over the single-solute model and can accurately predict the real segregation states obtained by hybrid Molecular Dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations within a broad temperature range with different solute concentrations before forming secondary phases. This dual-solute model provides an effective method for accurately predicting GB segregation in nanocrystalline metals.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potential-driven prediction of high-entropy ceramics with ultra-high melting points</title>

Abstract: Developing high-entropy ceramics (HECs) with ultra-high melting points (Tm) is crucial for their applications in ultra-high-temperature environments. However, related research has seldom been reported. Here, taking high-entropy diborides (HEBs) as an example, we develop a data-driven method to efficiently explore HEBs with ultra-high Tm via transferable machine-learning-potential-based molecular dynamics (MD). Specifically, a moment tensor potential (MTP) for HEBs with nine transition metal elements of group IVB, VB, and VIB is first constructed based on unary and binary diborides. Further studies on the performance of our constructed MTP have confirmed its remarkable accuracy, transferability, and reliability across both equimolar and non-equimolar HEB systems. Tm of HEBs are then accurately simulated through MD simulations based on the constructed MTP, and 24 features are simultaneously collected to enable reliable machine learning training. Five descriptors with the gradient boosting regression model are derived as the optimal combination for accurate Tm predictions in HEBs with genetic algorithms. Based on our established model, Tm of 32563 HEBs are eventually determined, achieving the maximum Tm of 3688 K in (Ti0.1Zr0.1Hf0.6Ta0.2)B2. The work presents a feasible approach to develop HECs with ultra-high Tm.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Topological Ferroelectric Metal with Giant Shift Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit for "ferroelectric metal" which combines seemingly incompatible spontaneous electric polarization and metallicity, has been assiduously ongoing but remains elusive. Unlike traditional ferroelectrics with a wide band gap, ferroelectric (FE) metals can naturally incorporate nontrivial band topology near the Fermi level, endowing them with additional exotic properties. Here, we show first-principles evidence that the metallic PtBi2 monolayer is an intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) topological FE metal, characterized by out-of-plane polarization and a moderate switching barrier. Moreover, it exhibits a topologically nontrivial electronic structure with Z2 invariant equal to 1, leading to a significant FE bulk photovoltaic effect. A slight strain can further enhance this effect to a remarkable level, which far surpass that of previously reported 2D/3D FE materials. Our work provides an important step towards realizing intrinsic monolayer topological FE metals and paves a promising way for future nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic hardness of hexagonal and orthorhombic Fe$_{3}$C, Co$_{3}$C, (Fe-Co)$_{3}$C, and their alloys with boron, nitrogen, and transition metals: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we considered a large set of materials that are closely related to orthorhombic Fe$_3$C (cementite) with the aim of characterizing trends in their intrinsic magnetic properties and identifying alloys that are optimal for applications. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the full concentration ranges of hexagonal ($\epsilon$) and orthorhombic ($\theta$) phases of (Fe-Co)$_3$C, (Fe-Co)$_3$(B-C), (Fe-Co)$_3$(C-N), and their alloys with 3$d$, 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals. The calculations were performed using the density functional theory implemented in the full-potential local-orbital code (FPLO). Calculated properties included formation energies, Curie temperatures, magnetic moments, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE), and magnetic hardnesses. The considered compositions exhibit a range of magnetic properties, including soft, semi-hard, and hard magnetic. The materials most promising for hard-magnetic applications are orthorhombic Co$_3$C compound, together with selected Co-rich orthorhombic (Fe,Co)$_3$C and hexagonal (Fe,Co)$_3$C alloys. The calculation results do not indicate that substituting with transition metals increases the potential of the alloys for permanent magnet applications. A significant drawback of alloying orthorhombic $\theta$-Fe$_3$C (cementite) with transition metals is the notable decline in the Curie temperature. We found that a considerable proportion of the orthorhombic Co$_3$(B-C-N) alloys are magnetically hard, of which boron substitution raises the Curie temperature and improves stability. By mapping the dependence of MAE on the concentration of elements covering both the 3$d$ (from Fe to Co) and 2$p$ (from B, through C, to N) positions, we have demonstrated for the first time the near isoelectronic nature of MAE. The latter observation may be particularly useful in designing compositions of new magnetically hard materials.</description>

Abstract: Uniaxially strained Fe--Co disordered alloys have emerged as promising candidates for cost-effective rare-earth-free permanent magnets due to their high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Using first-principles, fully relativistic calculations within the coherent potential approximation and PBE exchange-correlation potential, we explore the MAE of tetragonal Fe--Co alloys under uniaxial compression. Our results reveal a previously uncharted high-MAE region, distinct from known structures and accessible through uniaxial compression.</description>

      <title>Phase Composition of AlTiNbMoV, AlTiNbTaZr and AlTiNbMoCr Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys: A Correlation of Predictions and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing complex concentrated alloys (CCA), also known as high entropy alloys (HEA), requires reliable and accessible thermodynamic predictions due to vast space of possible compositions. Numerous semiempirical parameters have been developed for phase predictions over the years. However, in this paper we show that none of these parameters is a robust indicator of phase content in various refractory CCA. CALPHAD proved to be a more powerful tool for phase predictions, however, the predictions face several limitations. AlTiNbMoV, AlTiNbTaZr and AlTiNbMoCr alloys were prepared using blended elemental powder metallurgy. Their phase and chemical composition were investigated by the means of scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Apart from the minor contamination phases (Al2O3 and Ti(C,N,O)), AlTiNbMoV and AlTiNbMoCr exhibited single-phase solid solution microstructure at the homogenization temperature of 1400 {\deg}C, while Al3Zr5 based intermetallics were present in the AlTiNbTaZr alloy. None of the simple semiempirical parameter was able to predict phase content correctly in all three alloys. Predictions by CALPHAD (TCHEA4 database) were able to predict the phases with limited accuracy only. Critical limitation of the TCHEA4 database is that only binary and ternary phase diagrams are assessed and some more complex phases cannot be predicted.</description>

      <title>Accessing Numerical Energy Hessians with Graph Neural Network Potentials and Their Application in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access to the potential energy Hessian enables determination of the Gibbs free energy, and certain approaches to transition state search and optimization. Here, we demonstrate that off-the-shelf pretrained Open Catalyst Project (OCP) machine learned potentials (MLPs) determine the Hessian with great success (58 cm$^{-1}$ mean absolute error (MAE)) for intermediates adsorbed to heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. This enables the use of OCP models for the aforementioned applications. The top performing model, with a simple offset correction, gives good estimations of the vibrational entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy with an MAE of 0.042 eV at 300 K. The ability to leverage models to capture the translational entropy was also explored. It was determined that 94% of randomly sampled systems had a translational entropy greater than 0.1 eV at 300 K. This underscores the need to go beyond the harmonic approximation to consider the entropy introduced by adsorbate translation, which increases with temperature. Lastly, we used MLP determined Hessian information for transition state search and found we were able to reduce the number of unconverged systems by 65% to 93% overall convergence, improving on the baseline established by CatTSunami.</description>

      <title>Finite-element methods for noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in real-space pseudopotential density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient finite-element approach for large-scale real-space pseudopotential density functional theory (DFT) calculations incorporating noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling. The approach, implemented within the open-source DFT-FE computational framework, fills a significant gap in real-space DFT calculations using finite element basis sets, which offer several advantages over traditional DFT basis sets. In particular, we leverage the local reformulation of DFT electrostatics to derive the finite-element (FE) discretized governing equations involving two-component spinors. We subsequently utilize an efficient self-consistent field iteration approach based on Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration procedure exploiting the sparsity of local and non-local parts of FE discretized Hamiltonian to solve the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem based on a two-grid strategy. Furthermore, we propose using a generalized functional within the framework of noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling with a stationary point at the minima of the Kohn-Sham DFT energy functional to develop a unified framework for computing atomic forces and periodic unit-cell stresses. Validation studies against plane-wave implementations show excellent agreement in ground-state energetics, vertical ionization potentials, magnetic anisotropy energies, band structures, and spin textures. The proposed method achieves up to 8x-11x speed-ups for semi-periodic and non-periodic systems with $\sim$5000-7000 electrons in terms of minimum wall times compared to widely used plane-wave implementations on CPUs in addition to exhibiting significant computational advantage on GPUs.</description>

      <title>Gate control of superconducting current: Mechanisms, parameters and technological potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13734v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, the logic state of a device is set by a gate voltage (VG). The superconducting equivalent of such effect had remained unknown until it was recently shown that a VG can tune the superconducting current (supercurrent) flowing through a nanoconstriction in a superconductor. This gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) effect can lead to superconducting logics like CMOS logics, but with lower energy dissipation. The physical mechanism underlying the GCS effect, however, remains under debate. In this review article, we illustrate the main mechanisms proposed for the GCS effect, and the material and device parameters that mostly affect it based on the evidence reported. We will come to the conclusion that different mechanisms are at play in the different studies reported so far. We then outline studies that can help answer open questions on the effect and achieve control over it, which is key for applications. We finally give insights into the impact that the GCS effect can have towards high-performance computing with low-energy dissipation and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Isotropic atomic layer etching of MgO-doped lithium niobate using sequential exposures of H$_2$ and SF$_6$ plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a ferroelectric crystal of interest for integrated photonics owing to its large second-order optical nonlinearity and the ability to impart periodic poling via an external electric field. However, on-chip device performance based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by propagation losses arising from surface roughness and corrugations. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially smooth these features and thereby increase photonic performance, but no ALE process has been reported for LN. Here, we report an isotropic ALE process for $x$-cut MgO-doped LN using sequential exposures of H$_2$ and SF$_6$/Ar plasmas. We observe an etch rate of $1.59 \pm 0.02$ nm/cycle with a synergy of $96.9$%. We also demonstrate ALE can be achieved with SF$_6$/O$_2$ or Cl$_2$/BCl$_3$ plasma exposures in place of the SF$_6$/Ar plasma step with synergies of $99.5$% and $91.5$% respectively. The process is found to decrease the sidewall surface roughness of TFLN waveguides etched by physical Ar$^+$ milling by 30% without additional wet processing. Our ALE process could be used to smooth sidewall surfaces of TFLN waveguides as a post-processing treatment, thereby increasing the performance of TFLN nanophotonic devices and enabling new integrated photonic device capabilities.</description>

      <title>Electron correlations in the kagome flat band metal $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals offer a unique platform for investigating robust electron-correlation effects because of their lattice geometry, flat bands and multi-orbital nature. In the cases with active flat bands, recent theoretical studies have pointed to a rich phase diagram that contains not only electronic orders but also quantum criticality. Very recently, $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$ has emerged as a strong candidate for exploring such new physics. Here, using effective tight-binding models obtained from ab initio calculations, we study the effects of electronic correlations and symmetries on the electronic structure of $\rm CsCr_3 Sb_5$. The effective tight-binding model and Fermi surface comprise multiple Cr-$d$ orbitals and Sb-$p$ orbitals. The introduction of Hubbard-Kanamori interactions leads to orbital-selective band renormalization dominated by the $d_{xz}$ band, concurrently producing emergent flat bands very close to the Fermi level. Our analysis sets the stage for further investigations into the electronic properties of $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$, including electronic orders, quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity, which promise to shed much new light into the electronic materials with frustrated lattices and bring about new connections with the correlation physics of a variety of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Exponential Wall: Accelerating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts Screening using Local Surface Energy Descriptors from Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold considerable potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, making even machine learning-based screening calculations time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a rapid method for predicting HEA properties using data from monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). Central to our approach is the newly introduced local surface energy (LSE) descriptor, which captures local surface reactivity at atomic resolution. By applying linear regression, we successfully screened adsorption energies of molecules on HEAs based on LSEs derived from monometallic systems. Furthermore, we developed high-precision models by employing both classical and quantum machine learning. Our method enabled CO adsorption-energy calculations for 1000 quinary nanoparticles, comprising 201 atoms each, within a few days, considerably faster than density functional theory, which would require hundreds of years or neural network potentials, which would have taken hundreds of days. The proposed approach accelerates the exploration of the vast HEA chemical space, facilitating the design of novel catalysts.</description>

The latter contains a mixture of molecules with molecularly different structures.Inspired by the "chemical space"concept, I recently reported a study of the single-molecule mixture state that combines model construction and mathematical analysis,obtaining some interesting results.(Int.

      <title>Fundamental nature of the self-field critical current in superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to conduct electric current without dissipating energy is a property of superconductors that is used in magnetic systems utilized in healthcare, natural sciences, and ongoing global projects in nuclear fusion and aviation. The highest dissipation-less current is named the critical current, and this is one of the prime practical properties of superconductors (together with the critical current density, Jc). Recently, Goyal et al reported a record high Jc~190 MA/cm2 at 4.2 K in (RE)BCO films, exceeding the highest Jc in the best commercial (RE)BCO wires by a factor of five. Based on the huge potential practical impact of this high Jc, we examined the raw experimental data and found that this high value originates from an error in the conversion of units. The real Jc is 10 times smaller than the reported Jc, consistent with values currently achieved by many manufacturers.</description>
