      <title>Hereditary Graph Product Structure Theory and Induced Subgraphs of Strong Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16789v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the celebrated Planar Product Structure Theorem by Dujmovic et al, and also related graph product structure results, can be formulated with the induced subgraph containment relation. Precisely, we prove that if a graph G is a subgraph of the strong product of a graph Q of bounded maximum degree (such as a path) and a graph M of bounded tree-width, then G is an induced subgraph of the strong product of Q and a graph M' of bounded tree-width being at most exponential in the maximum degree of Q and the tree-width of M. In the course of proving this result, we introduce and study H-clique-width, a new single structural measure that captures a hereditary analogue of the traditional product structure (where, informally, the strong product has one factor from the graph class H and one factor of bounded clique-width).</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities and prove the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>
