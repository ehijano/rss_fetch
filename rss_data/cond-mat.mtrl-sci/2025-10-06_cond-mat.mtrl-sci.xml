      <title>Slow-phonon control of spin Edelstein effect in Rashba $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have zero net magnetization yet feature spin-split bands that host spin-polarized states. Here, we investigate how slow lattice vibrations (phonons) influence both the intrinsic and externally induced spin polarizations in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. For the induced spin polarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling (EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein effect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that moderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via both intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the onset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition arises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split bands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete collapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the Rashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of altermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry between spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling, rendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications. We further investigate how the phonon coupling to the altermagnetic order, Rashba spin-orbit strength, and carrier doping collectively tune the depolarization transition. Our findings demonstrate that phonon scattering (e.g., through various substrates) offers a powerful means for on-demand control of spin polarization, enabling reversible switching between spin-polarized and depolarized states -- a key functionality for advancing spin logic architectures and optimizing next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization engineering in $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets host unconventional spin-polarized bands despite zero net magnetization, but controlling their spin structure remains challenging. We propose a multi-field approach to engineer spin polarization in $d$-wave altermagnets using gating, optical driving, and in-plane electric fields, which enable tunable and switchable polarizations along multiple directions. Optical driving induces out-of-plane ($z$) polarization, while gating and in-plane fields generate $x$- and $y$-polarizations via the Edelstein effect, all of which are experimentally detectable. We further find that spin- and band-selective doping induces chiral optical activity, a feature unique to altermagnets. Our approach provides a versatile route for full control of spin polarization in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Epitaxially-stabilized growth of w\"ustite FeO on 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron(II) monoxide (FeO) is thermodynamically stable in the halite (w\"ustite) structure only at elevated temperatures in a typically non-stoichiometric, Fe-deficient, Fe$_{1-z}$O form that tends to phase separate and/or transform into metallic $\alpha$-Fe and magnetite Fe$_3$O$_4$ at ambient conditions. Here we report on the successful growth of up to 180 nm thick $(111)$-oriented FeO heteroepitaxial films on slightly lattice-matched 4H-SiC$(0001)$ using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The films have flat, terraced surfaces with tall multi-layer steps. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) collectively confirm the epilayer as phase-pure w\"ustite FeO, with atomically sharp FeO/SiC interfaces. The films are found to exhibit a slight misfit strain-induced rhombohedral distortion that does not appear to vary over the range of thicknesses examined. These results demonstrate the power of epitaxial stabilization for integrating a thermodynamically unstable, yet functionally interesting material with a commercially available and technologically important semiconductor platform.</description>

      <title>Active-Learning Inspired Ab Initio Theory-Experiment Loop Approach for Management of Material Defects: Application to Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</description>

      <title>The line bundle regime and the scale-dependence of continuum dislocation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD) has become the state-of-the-art theoretical approach for mesoscale dislocation plasticity of metals. Within this approach, there are multiple CDD theories that can all be derived from the principles of statistical mechanics. In these theories density-based measures are used to represent dislocation lines. Establishing these density measures requires some level of coarse graining with the result of losing track of some parts of the dislocation population due to cancellation in the tangent vectors of unaligned dislocations. The leading CDD theories either treat dislocations as nearly parallel or distributed locally over orientation space. The difference between these theories is a matter of the spatial resolution at which the definition of the relevant dislocation density field holds: for fine resolutions, single dislocations are resolved and there is no cancellation; for coarse resolutions, whole dislocation loops could contribute at a single point and there is complete cancellation. In the current work, a formulation of the resolution-dependent transition between these limits is presented in terms of the statistics of dislocation line orientation fluctuations about a local average line direction. From this formulation, a study of the orientation fluctuation behavior in intermediate resolution regimes is conducted. Two possible closure equations for truncating the moment sequence of the fluctuation distributions relating the two theories mentioned above are evaluated from data, the newly introduced line bundle closure and the previous standard maximum entropy closure relations. The line bundle closure relation is shown to be accurate for coarse-graining lengths up to half the dislocation spacing and the maximum entropy closure is found to poorly agree with the data at all coarse-graining lengths.</description>

      <title>Improper-proper ferroelectric competition as a mechanism for multistate polarisation and ferrielectric-like behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we re-explore a simple textbook Landau model describing improper ferroelectricity and show that in the limit where both proper and improper instabilities exist and compete, improper ferroelectrics can display switching between multiple polarisation states. Using first principles calculations we highlight how the hexagonal tungsten bronze materials may be an archetypal case, with the possibility to switch between improper and proper phases. The resulting functional characteristics are akin to "ferrielectrics", with switching behaviour in the form of a triple hysteresis loop. Such functionality could be ideal for creating non-volatile multistate systems for use in memory devices or as a backbone for neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Thermoelectric Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric materials requires models that are both accurate and interpretable. Traditional machine learning approaches, while effective at property prediction, often act as black boxes and provide limited physical insight. In this work, we introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) for the prediction of thermoelectric properties, focusing on the Seebeck coefficient and band gap. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs achieve comparable predictive accuracy while offering explicit symbolic representations of structure--property relationships. This dual capability enables both reliable predictions and the extraction of physically meaningful functional forms. Benchmarking against literature models further highlights the robustness and generalisability of the approach. Our findings demonstrate that KANs provide a powerful framework for reverse engineering materials with targeted thermoelectric properties, bridging the gap between predictive performance and scientific interpretability.</description>

      <title>Photovoltaic Performance of a Rotationally Faulted Multilayer Graphene/n-Si Schottky Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and photovoltaic performance of a rotationally faulted multilayer graphene (rf-MLG)/n-Si Schottky junction device. A thickness-controlled rf-MLG is synthesized using a 5 {\mu}m Ni foil catalyst via the chemical vapor deposition method and transferred to the n-Si substrate via a polymer-free process, enabling facile and cost-effective fabrication. The device demonstrates an ideality factor of 1.67, a rectification factor of approximately 4x10^5 at {\pm}1.0 V, and a Schottky barrier height of 0.83 eV. A strong linear relationship between light intensity and photocurrent is also observed. Furthermore, the device exhibits a peak external quantum efficiency of ~26% at 540 nm and a peak internal quantum efficiency of ~97% at 410 nm. Transient photocurrent and photovoltaic measurements show approximately one-microsecond extraction and several-millisecond recombination times, respectively, revealing effective charge collection for photovoltaic applications. These results indicate that the rf-MLG/n-Si Schottky junction is well-formed and achieves performance comparable to that of SLG devices, demonstrating its potential for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network approach to the point defect model for electrochemical oxide film growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, and robust enforcement of boundary conditions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINN simulations in electrochemical physics, highlighting the novelty and practical impact of our approach.</description>

      <title>Redox Chemistry of LiCoO$_2$, LiNiO$_2$, and LiNi$_{1/3}$Mn$_{1/3}$Co$_{1/3}$O$_2$ Cathodes: Deduced via XPS, DFT+DMFT, and Charge Transfer Multiplet Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of the physicochemical bulk properties during the Li deintercalation (charging) process is critical for optimizing battery cathode materials. In this study, we combine X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, and charge transfer multiplet (CTM) model simulations to investigate how hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen 2p orbitals evolves with Li deintercalation. Based on the presented approach combining theoretical calculations and experimental studies of pristine and deintercalated cathodes, two important problems of ion batteries can be addressed: i) the detailed electronic structure and involved changes with deintercalation providing information of the charge compensation mechanism, and ii) the precise experimental analysis of XPS data which are dominated by charge transfer coupled to final-state effects affecting the satellite structure. As main result for the investigated Li TM oxides, it can be concluded that the electron transfer coupled to the Li$^{+}$-ion migration does not follow a rigid band model but is modified due to changes in TM 3d and O 2p states hybridization. Furthermore, this integrated approach identifies the 2p XPS satellite peak intensity of TM as an effective indicator of the redox chemistry. With that the redox chemistry of cathodes can be deduced, thus offering a foundation for designing more efficient battery materials.</description>

      <title>Subthermal Mean Transverse Energies Induced by Electron Refraction on the Jump in Mass at the Surface of Multialkali Photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for photocathode materials with low mean transverse energies (MTEs) and, hence, low intrinsic emittance is of crucial importance for various fields of particle and solid state physics. Here, we demonstrate that polycrystalline multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes with negative effective electron affinity (NEA) have MTE values at room temperature by a factor of 2 lower than those of monocrystalline \textit{p}-GaAs(Cs,O) photocathodes. These low MTE values are due to the electron refraction on the jump in mass, between a small effective mass in Na$_{2}$KSb and free electron mass in vacuum. It is proved that, at the NEA state, up to half of photoelectrons are emitted in a narrow-angle cone with the fractional MTE of 9\,meV at room temperature. We also showed that the transition from NEA to positive effective affinity results in the subthermal total MTE of the Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathode, along with quantum efficiency of about 10$^{-2}$. The physical reasons for the manifestation of the refraction effect in multialkali photocathodes are discussed, opening up opportunities for the development of high-brightness and ultracold robust electron sources.</description>

      <title>Structural Chirality and Natural Optical Activity across the $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ Phase Transition in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural optical activity (NOA), the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, has traditionally been associated with structural chirality. However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to conceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly correlate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the relationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can arise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the rotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group. %
In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical activity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic structural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$) to low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups. This transition, driven by the condensation of a zone-center $\Gamma_3$ phonon mode, reverses the screw axis type given by the space group symbol while leaving the sign of the optical activity unchanged. By following the evolution of the structure and the optical response along the transition pathway, we clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior. We demonstrate that the sense of optical rotation is determined not by the nominal helicity of the screw axis given in the space group symbol, but by the atomic-scale helicity of the most polarizable atoms of the structure.</description>

      <title>Electrically modulated light-emitting diodes driven by resonant and antiresonant tunneling between Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the electron tunneling mechanisms in diverse materials systems constitutes a versatile strategy for tailoring the properties of optoelectronic devices. In this domain, bipolar vertical tunneling junctions composed of van der Waals materials with vastly different electronic band structures enable simultaneous injection of electrons and holes into an optically active material, providing a universal blueprint for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Efficient modulation of the injection efficiency has previously been demonstrated by creating resonant states within the energy barrier formed by the luminescent material. Here, we present an alternative approach towards resonant tunneling conditions by fabricating tunneling junctions composed entirely from gapped materials: Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as electrodes, hBN as a tunneling barrier, and monolayer WSe$_2$ as a luminescent medium. The characterization of such LEDs revealed a nonmonotonous evolution of the electroluminescence intensity with the tunneling bias. The dominant role driving the characteristics of the electron tunneling was associated with the relative alignment of the density of states in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ electrodes. The unique device architecture introduced here presents a universal pathway towards LEDs operating at room temperature with electrically modulated emission intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of excitonic transport in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers have attracted increasing interest in recent years in order to develop nano-optoelectronic devices made with 2D materials. These studies began with low to moderate optical excitation regimes, and more recently have focused on high injection regimes where nonlinear effects appear. This article is focused on the transport of biexcitons by spatially and temporally resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy at high excitation flux. The study is carried out on a high-quality WSe$_2$ monolayer encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. The results show that a Seebeck current affects transport in connection with the presence of hot biexcitons. In particular, we observe the formation of spatial rings, also called halos, which have been observed in other excitonic gases. These results tend to generalize the importance of high-energy populations in excitonic transport in TMD, even for complex and heavy excitonic particles.</description>

      <title>Sliding multiferroicity in hexagonal stacked CrI3</title>

Abstract: Developing new multiferroics at the two-dimensional (2D) limit with energy-efficient magnetoelectric coupling can inform the interplay physics of novel orders and advance on-chip high-performance computing applications. Here we apply stacking order engineering to create a new type of 2D multiferroics, namely sliding multiferroics, based on polar hexagonal stacked (H-stacked) CrI3. This new stacking order removes structural inversion symmetry and gives rise to room temperature sliding ferroelectricity, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, second harmonic generation spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Building upon the gate-dependent reflective magnetic circular dichroism, first-principles calculations, and modeling, sliding ferroelectricity is shown to interplay with an emergent interfacial ferromagnetism via interlayer spin-polarized charge transfer. This coupling mechanism results in non-volatile magnetic switching by as low as 0.4V across the H-stacked CrI3. Our demonstration introduces polar stacking order engineering of 2D magnets as a general approach to create non-volatile 2D multiferroics with efficient magnetoelectric coupling, paving the way for low-power electronics and spintronics at the atomically thin limit.</description>

      <title>Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of carbon capture in periodic metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon capture is vital for decarbonizing heavy industries such as steel and chemicals. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high surface area and structural tunability, are promising materials for CO2 capture. This study focuses on Fe-MOF-74, a magnetic Mott insulator with exposed metal sites that enhance CO2 adsorption. Its strongly correlated electronic structure challenges standard DFT methods, which often yield inconsistent predictions. We initially benchmark adsorption energies using various DFT functionals, revealing substantial variability and underscoring the need for more accurate approaches, such as those provided by quantum computing. However, practical quantum algorithms are far less established for simulations of periodic materials, particularly when the plane-wave basis set, often comprising tens of thousands of basis vectors, is used. To address this, we employ an active space reduction strategy based on Wannier functions and natural orbital selection. Localized orbitals around the adsorption site are identified, and MP2 natural orbitals are used to improve convergence of correlation energies. Adsorption energies are then computed using a quantum number-preserving ansatz within the variational quantum eigensolver framework. In addition to classical simulations, we conduct quantum experiments using the sample-based quantum diagonalization method. Although current hardware limits the size of feasible simulations, our approach offers a more efficient and scalable path forward. These results advance the applicability of quantum algorithms to realistic models of carbon capture and periodic materials more broadly.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau theory of spin pumping through an antiferromagnetic layer near the N\'{e}el temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin pumping is a microwave-driven means for injecting spins from a ferromagnet into the adjacent target material. The insertion of a thin antiferromagnetic layer between the ferromagnet and the target material is known to enhance the spin pumping signal. Here, in view of describing dynamic fluctuations of the N\'{e}el order parameter, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin pumping in a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/heavy metal trilayer in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$. When there exists an interfacial exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic spins and the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el order parameter at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, we find a strongly frequency-dependent enhancement of the pumped spin current that is peaked at $T_{\rm N}$. The present finding offers an explanation for the enhanced spin pumping with strong frequency dependence observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/CoO/Pt system.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect for the altermagnetic candidate MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate magnetocaloric effect for single crystals of MnTe altermagnet at the transition to the state with spontaneous spin polarization, i.e. well below the N\'eel temperature of MnTe. The isothermal magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$ is calculated from the experimental magnetization curves by using Maxwell relation. We observe well-defined magnetocaloric effect as a narrow $\Delta S$ peak around the cricital temperature $T_c\approx 81$~K, which is accompanied by sharp magnetization jump. This behavior is unusual for standard ferromagnetic transitions, so it confirms the predicted spin-orbit-induced spin polarization in the MnTe altermagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Heterogenous Dynamics in a Polymer Solution Revealed through Measurement of Ultraslow Convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding solution-phase aggregation and dynamics in complex fluids is critical for material processing, yet widely used dynamic light scattering (DLS) fails for strongly attenuating systems such as conjugated polymers. We use X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to probe the dynamics of a polymer, PM7, in toluene, revealing unexpected oscillations in the autocorrelation function that show vertical flow during measurement. Despite the relatively low X-ray absorption, measured flow velocities scale with X-ray beam power and suggest convective transport. Our analyses reveal both mobile and static scatterers that together produce oscillatory, heterodyne features in the measured correlation functions. Finite element simulations predict flow velocities much larger than observed, suggesting that entanglements of the aggregates slow their motion. These results provide a direct measurement of ultra-slow convection and highlight the need to explicitly account for even modest beam heating in interpreting XPCS results. Moreover, the observation of distinct scatterer populations underscores the structural complexity of conjugated polymer solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-dense domain walls are increasingly important for many devices but their microscopic properties are so far not fully understood. Here we use molecular dynamic simulations to study the domain wall stability in the prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO3 combining core-shell pair potentials and a coarse-grained effective Hamiltonian. We transfer the discussion of the field-driven nucleation and motion of domain walls to thermally induced modifications of the wall without an external driving force. Our simulations show that domain wall dynamics and stability depend crucially on microscopic thermal fluctuations. Enhanced fluctuations at domain walls may result in the formation of critical nuclei for the permanent shift of the domain wall. If two domain walls are close - put in other words, when domains are small - thermal fluctuations can be sufficient to bring domain walls into contact and lead to the annihilation of small domains. This is even true well below the Curie temperature and when domain walls are initially as far apart as 6 unit cells. Such small domains are, thus, not stable and limit the maximum achievable domain wall density in nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Excess energy and countercurrents after a quantum kick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum system of interacting particles under the effect of a static external potential is hereby described as kicked when that potential suddenly starts moving with a constant velocity v. If initially in a stationary state, the excess energy at any time after the kick equals $v \langle P \rangle (t)$, with P being the total momentum of the system. If the system is finite and remains bound, the long time average of the excess energy tends to $Mv^2$, with M the system's total mass, or a related expression if there is particle emission. $Mv^2$ is twice what expected from an infinitely smooth onset of motion, and any monotonic onset is expected to increase the average energy to a value within both limits. In a macroscopic system, a particle flow emerges countering the potential's motion when electrons stay partially behind. For charged particles the described kinetic kick is equivalent to the kick given by the infinitely short electric-field pulse $E = \frac{m}{q} v \delta (t)$ to the system at rest, useful as a formal limit in ultrafast phenomena. A linear-response analysis of low-v countercurrents in kicked metals shows that the coefficient of the linear term in v is the Drude weight. Non-linear in v countercurrents are expected for insulators through the electron-hole excitations induced by the kick, going as $v^3$ at low v for centrosymmetric ones. First-principles calculations for simple solids are used to ratify those predictions, although the findings apply more generally to systems such as Mott insulators or cold lattices of bosons or fermions.</description>

      <title>Achieving accurate entropy and melting point by ab initio molecular dynamics and zentropy theory: Application to fluoride and chloride molten salts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10692v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have recently developed a breakthrough methodology for rapidly computing entropy in both solids and liquids by integrating a multiscale entropy approach (known as zentropy theory) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables entropy estimation from a single MD trajectory by analyzing the probabilities of local structural configurations and atomic distributions, effectively addressing the long-standing challenge of capturing configurational entropy. Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Tuning Thermal Conductivity and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Carbon and Boron Nitride Moir\'e Diamanes via Twist Angle Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of interlayer twist angle on lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) and band gap renormalization in boron nitride and carbon Moir\'e diamanes. Moment tensor potentials were used for calculating energies and forces of interatomic interactions. The methods based on the solution of Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons and the GreenKubo (GK) formula were utilized to calculate LTC. The 20-40 % difference in LTC values obtained with GK and BTE-based methods showed the importance of high-order anharmonic contributions to LTC. Significant reduction (by 4.5 - 9 times) of the in-plane LTC with the twist angle increase caused by the growth of structural disorder was observed in the Moir\'e diamanes. This growth of disorder also leads to higher band gap renormalization (induced by classical nuclei motion) in the structures with higher twist angles. Significant band gap renormalization values obtained considering the quantum nuclear effects are caused by the high phonon frequencies related to the bonds with hydrogen atoms on the Moir\'e diamanes surfaces. Understanding of the twist angle effect on LTC and electron-phonon coupling in the Moir\'e diamanes provides a fundamental basis for manipulating their thermal and electronic properties, making these materials promising for thermoelectrics, microelectronics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>AstroECP: towards more practical Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based technique that enables bulk-sample characterization of crystallographic defects (e.g. dislocations, stacking faults, low angle boundaries). Despite its potential, ECCI remains underused for quantitative defect analysis as compared to transmission electron microscope (TEM) based methods. Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.</description>

      <title>Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The V2O3 phase diagram contains two insulating phases and one metallic phase with different lattice structures. The stability of these phases is very sensitive to pressure, offering a mechanism to tune phase transitions by inducing strain in thin films. The most studied source of strain is lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. In this work, however, we find that the film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch can be made to play a dominant role by modifying the substrate morphology. When grown on sapphire, the lattice mismatch induces compressive strain in the V2O3 films, whereas thermal expansion mismatch induces tensile strain. We find that minute changes in substrate morphology may relax the compressive strain component, allowing the thermally-induced tensile component to overcome it. Thus, by simple annealing of the substrates to create either a flat or stepped morphology, strongly compressive or tensile strains may be induced in the films. This results in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases at all temperatures, exhibiting many orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. To elucidate the strain relaxation mechanism, we use high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent crystallographic defects in the V2O3. These findings offer a hitherto underexplored mechanism to tune strain in thin films, deepen our understanding of the effects of structural degrees of freedom on phase stability of a canonical Mott insulator and may allow for applications requiring insulator-metal switching above room temperature.</description>
