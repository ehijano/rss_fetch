      <title>Topoi of automata I: Four topoi of automata and regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both topos theory and automata theory are known for their multi-faceted nature and relationship with topology, algebra, logic, and category theory. This paper aims to clarify the topos-theoretic aspects of automata theory, particularly demonstrating through two main theorems how regular (and non-regular) languages arise in topos-theoretic calculation. First, it is shown that the four different notions of automata form four types of Grothendieck topoi, illustrating how the technical details of automata theory are described by topos theory. Second, we observe that the four characterizations of regular languages (DFA, Myhill-Nerode theorem, finite monoids, profinite words) provide Morita-equivalent definitions of a single Boolean-ringed topos, situating this within the context of Olivia Caramello's 'Toposes as Bridges.'
  This paper also serves as a preparation for follow-up papers, which deal with the relationship between hyperconnected geometric morphisms and algebraic/geometric aspects of formal language theory.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence Problem of E-Pattern Languages with Length Constraints is Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. Length constraints restrict valid substitutions of variables by associating the variables of a pattern with a system (or disjunction of systems) of linear diophantine inequalities. Pattern languages with length constraints contain only words in which all variables are substituted to words with lengths that fulfill such a given set of length constraints. We consider membership, inclusion, and equivalence problems for erasing and non-erasing pattern languages with length constraints. Our main result shows that the erasing equivalence problem, one of the most prominent open problems in the realm of patterns-becomes undecidable if length constraints are allowed in addition to variable equality. Additionally, it is shown that the terminal-free inclusion problem-another prominent open problem in the realm of patterns-is also undecidable in this setting. It is also shown that considering regular constraints, i.e., associating variables also with regular languages as additional restrictions together with length constraints for valid substitutions, results in undecidability of the non-erasing equivalence problem. This sets a first upper bound on constraints to obtain undecidability in this case, as this problem is trivially decidable in the case of no constraints and as it has unknown decidability if only regular- or only length-constraints are considered.</description>

      <title>Querying Perception Streams with Spatial Regular Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception in fields like robotics, manufacturing, and data analysis generates large volumes of temporal and spatial data to effectively capture their environments. However, sorting through this data for specific scenarios is a meticulous and error-prone process, often dependent on the application, and lacks generality and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce SpREs as a novel querying language for pattern matching over perception streams containing spatial and temporal data derived from multi-modal dynamic environments. To highlight the capabilities of SpREs, we developed the STREM tool as both an offline and online pattern matching framework for perception data. We demonstrate the offline capabilities of STREM through a case study on a publicly available AV dataset (Woven Planet Perception) and its online capabilities through a case study integrating STREM in ROS with the CARLA simulator. We also conduct performance benchmark experiments on various SpRE queries. Using our matching framework, we are able to find over 20,000 matches within 296 ms making STREM applicable in runtime monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Program Analysis via Multiple Context Free Language Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context-free language (CFL) reachability is a standard approach in static analyses, where the analysis question is phrased as a language reachability problem on a graph $G$ wrt a CFL L. While CFLs lack the expressiveness needed for high precision, common formalisms for context-sensitive languages are such that the corresponding reachability problem is undecidable. Are there useful context-sensitive language-reachability models for static analysis?
  In this paper, we introduce Multiple Context-Free Language (MCFL) reachability as an expressive yet tractable model for static program analysis. MCFLs form an infinite hierarchy of mildly context sensitive languages parameterized by a dimension $d$ and a rank $r$. We show the utility of MCFL reachability by developing a family of MCFLs that approximate interleaved Dyck reachability, a common but undecidable static analysis problem.
  We show that MCFL reachability be computed in $O(n^{2d+1})$ time on a graph of $n$ nodes when $r=1$, and $O(n^{d(r+1)})$ time when $r&gt;1$. Moreover, we show that when $r=1$, the membership problem has a lower bound of $n^{2d}$ based on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, while reachability for $d=1$ has a lower bound of $n^{3}$ based on the combinatorial Boolean Matrix Multiplication Hypothesis. Thus, for $r=1$, our algorithm is optimal within a factor $n$ for all levels of the hierarchy based on $d$.
  We implement our MCFL reachability algorithm and evaluate it by underapproximating interleaved Dyck reachability for a standard taint analysis for Android. Used alongside existing overapproximate methods, MCFL reachability discovers all tainted information on 8 out of 11 benchmarks, and confirms $94.3\%$ of the reachable pairs reported by the overapproximation on the remaining 3. To our knowledge, this is the first report of high and provable coverage for this challenging benchmark set.</description>

      <title>Extended Stone Duality via Monoidal Adjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensions of Stone-type dualities have a long history in algebraic logic and have also been instrumental for proving results in algebraic language theory. We show how to extend abstract categorical dualities via monoidal adjunctions, subsuming various incarnations of classical extended Stone and Priestley duality as special cases. Guided by these categorical foundations, we investigate residuation algebras, which are algebraic models of language derivatives, and show the subcategory of derivation algebras to be dually equivalent to the category of profinite ordered monoids, restricting to a duality between boolean residuation algebras and profinite monoids. We further refine this duality to capture relational morphisms of profinite ordered monoids, which dualize to natural morphisms of residuation algebras. As a special case of the discrete version of the duality between monoids and complete residuation algebras, we obtain a novel concrete description for the dual of the category of all small categories and functors.</description>

      <title>Bisimulations and Logics for Higher-Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-dimensional automata (HDAs) are models of non-interleaving concurrency for analyzing concurrent systems. There is a rich literature that deals with bisimulations for concurrent systems, and some of them have been extended to HDAs. However, no logical characterizations of these relations are currently available for HDAs.
  In this work, we address this gap by introducing Ipomset modal logic, a Hennessy-Milner type logic over HDAs, and show that it characterizes Path-bisimulation, a variant of the standard ST-bisimulation. We also define a notion of Cell-bisimulation, using the open-maps framework of Joyal, Nielsen, and Winskel, and establish the relationship between these bisimulations (and also their "strong" variants, which take restrictions into account). In our work, we rely on the new categorical definition of HDAs as presheaves over concurrency lists and on track objects.</description>
