      <title>An Invertible All-optical Logic Gate on Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an invertible all-optical gate on chip, with the roles of control and signal switchable by slightly adjusting their relative arrival time at the gate. It is based on quantum Zeno blockade driven by sum-frequency generation in a periodic-poled lithium niobate microring resonator. For two nearly-identical nanosecond pulses, the later arriving pulse is modulated by the earlier arriving one, resulting in 2.4 and 3.9 power extinction between the two, respectively, when their peak power is 1 mW and 2 mW. Our results, while to be improved and enriched, herald a new paradigm of logical gates and circuits for exotic applications.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate optomechanics in the sub-terahertz regime. An optical racetrack resonator, patterned from thin-film lithium niobate, is suspended to support mechanical structures oscillating at these extremely high frequencies, which are read out through cavity optomechanical coupling. Our hybrid platform paves the way for advancing mechanical systems in the quantum regime at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Photocurrent Hysteresis in Photoferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon-electron interactions are generally volatile and the intricate multiphysics details of photoexcited carrier dynamics are not yet distinguished. How to nonvolatile control the physical state through all-optical means and clarify the intricate physical processes has been a long-term goal pursued in polar materials. Photoferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3 holds the great potential for capturing multimodal nonvolatile states due to the spontaneous reversible in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations and its tunable light-matter interactions arising from the electronic degree of freedom. Here we uncover a nonvolatile zero-bias ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis response with an all-optical scheme, diagnosed by in-plane and out-of-plane terahertz waves emitted from the photoferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3. The mechanism of such ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis emerges as a result of anomalous bulk linear and circular photovoltaic effect synchronously driven by local polarization rearrangement. Utilizing anisotropic ferroelectric kinetics-induced relative phase between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, we further show flexibly selective chirality, tunable rotational angle, and optimizable ellipticity of terahertz wave polarizations. Our finding offers a promising avenue towards direct ultrafast nonvolatile processing of photocurrent signals through an all-optical scheme.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mueller matrix polarimetry using generalized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mueller matrices provide a complete description of a medium's response to excitation by polarized light, and their characterization is important across a broad range of applications from ellipsometry in material science to polarimetry in biochemistry, medicine and astronomy. Here we introduce single-shot Mueller matrix polarimetry based on generalized measurements performed with a Poincar\'e beam. We determine the Mueller matrix of a homogeneous medium with unknown optical activity by detecting its optical response to a Poincar\'e beam, which across its profile contains all polarization states, and analyze the resulting polarization pattern in terms of four generalized measurements, which are implemented as a path-displaced Sagnac interferometer. We illustrate the working of our Mueller matrix polarimetry on the example of tilted and rotated wave plates and find excellent agreement with predictions as well as alternative Stokes measurements. After initial calibration, the alignment of the device stays stable for up to 8 hours, promising suitability for the dynamic characterization of Mueller matrices that change in time.</description>

      <title>The Maxwell evolution equation of electromagnetic resonators: a mathematical proof with explicit derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent publication [1], the authors employ electromagnetic quasinormal-mode theory to establish an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation governing resonator dynamics. This resulting equation bears resemblance to the classical evolution equation proposed heuristically in the temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT), yet it also presents differences. One significant difference is that the driving force in the EME equation is proportional to the derivative of the incident field, whereas in the CMT evolution equation, it is proportional to the incident field itself. This unexpected finding was substantiated by a numerical test and a mathematical demonstration in [1]. The test remains undisputed in this study. However, the demonstration unfortunately relies on unjustified shortcuts. We promptly highlight these shortcuts while proposing an alternative demonstration that is direct and indisputable. The new demonstration provides a firm mathematical foundation for the EME equation and reinforces its credibility.</description>

      <title>Spin Hamiltonians in the Modulated Momenta of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic solvers that are able to find the ground states of different spin Hamiltonians can be used to study many interactive physical systems and combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we establish a real-and-momentum space correspondence of spin Hamiltonians by spatial light transport. The real-space spin interaction is determined by modulating the momentum-space flow of light. This principle is formulated as a generalized Plancherel theorem, allowing us to implement a simple optical simulator that can find the ground states for any displacement-dependent spin interactions. Particularly, we use this principle to reveal the exotic magnetic phase diagram from a J1-J2-J3 model, and we also observe the vortex-mediated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dynamics from the XY model. These experiments exhibit high calculation precision by subtly controlling spin interactions from the momentum space of light, offering a promising scheme to explore novel physical effects.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of Coherent versus spontaneous Raman Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their sub picosecond temporal resolution, coherent Raman spectroscopies have been proposed as a viable extension of Spontaneous Raman (SR) thermometry, to determine dynamics of mode specific vibrational energy content during out of equilibrium molecular processes. Here we show that the presence of multiple laser fields stimulating the vibrational coherences introduces additional quantum pathways, resulting in destructive interference. This ultimately reduces the thermal sensitivity of single spectral lines, nullifying it for harmonic vibrations and temperature independent polarizability. We demonstrate how harnessing anharmonic signatures such as vibrational hot bands enables coherent Raman thermometry.</description>

      <title>Tight Non-Radiating Bends of 3D-Printed Dielectric Image Lines Based on Electromagnetic Bandgap Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports on a novel compact, low-loss bending technique for additively manufactured dielectric image lines between 140 GHz and 220 GHz. Conventional bending approaches require either large curvature radii or technologically challenging permittivity variations to prevent radiation loss at line discontinuities, e.g. caused by narrow bends. In contrast, this work uses extremely compact, easy-to-manufacture electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) cells to solve the afore mentioned challenge for the first time. These offer excellent reflection properties and thus enable broadband and low-loss (IL &lt; 1 dB) guidance of electromagnetic waves by means of total reflection. Without increasing the complexity of the process, both the high-pass behaviour and the enormous space requirement of conventional dielectric bends are completely avoided. In addition, the use of EBGs improves the mutual isolation of dielectric image lines of up to 30 dB. Therefore, a promising solution for the realization of narrow, 3D-printed, low-loss signal distribution networks in the sub-THz domain is offered.</description>

      <title>One-way Valley-locked waveguide with large channel achieved by all-dielectric Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity, which denotes the asymmetric or even unidirectional transmission of light, constitutes the cornerstone of modern photonic circuits. In the realm of photonic devices, it has been widely utilized in isolators, circulators and so on. Recent topology in artificial materials, an unprecedented degree of freedom, has been proposed to solve the effect of impurities on nonreciprocal transmission. However, in view of the bulk-edge correspondence, the spatial width of the transmission channel with uniform field distribution is quite narrow and needs further exploration. In this paper, we proposed a one-way valley-locked waveguide with a large channel in an all-dielectric photonic crystal. Quite different from the topological edge modes, the unidirectional property of our waveguide comes from the bulk modes with valley-lock, which can fully utilize the whole dimension of the structure with an efficiency of 100%. Additionally, the electrical field is uniformly distributed across the entire channel, which opens a new avenue for low-loss nonreciprocity devices.</description>

      <title>Directed High-Energy Infrared Laser Beams for Photovoltaic Generation of Electric Power at Remote Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transferring energy without transferring mass is a powerful paradigm to address the challenges faced when the access to, or the deployment of, the infrastructure for energy conversion is locally impossible or impractical. Laser beaming holds the promise of effectively implementing this paradigm. With this perspective, this work evaluates the optical-to-electrical power conversion that is created when a collimated laser beam illuminates a silicon photovoltaic solar cell that is located kilometers away from the laser. The laser is a CW high-energy Yb-doped fiber laser emitting at a center wavelength of 1075 nm with ~1 m2 of effective beam area. For 20 kW illumination of a solar panel having 0.6 m2 of area, optical simulations and thermal simulations indicate electrical output power of 3000 Watts at a panel temperature of 550 K. Our investigations show that thermo-radiative cells are rather inefficient. In contrast, an optimized approach to harvest laser energy is achieved by using a hybrid module consisting of a photovoltaic cell and a thermo-electric generator. Finally, practical considerations related to infrared power beaming are discussed and its potential applications are outlined.</description>

      <title>Shrinking a gradient index lens antenna system with a spaceplate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of optical systems is an ongoing challenge across the electromagnetic spectrum. While the thickness of optical elements themselves can be reduced using advances in metamaterials, it is the voids between these elements -- which are necessary parts of an optical system -- that occupy most of the volume. Recently, a novel optical element coined a `spaceplate' was proposed, that replaces a region of free space with a thinner optical element that emulates the free-space optical response function -- thus having the potential to substantially shrink the volume of optical systems. While there have been a few proof-of-principle demonstrations of spaceplates, they have not yet been deployed in a real-world optical system. In this work, we use a bespoke-designed spaceplate to reduce the length of a gradient index (GRIN) lens microwave antenna. Our antenna is designed to operate at 23.5 GHz, and the incorporation of a nonlocal metamaterial spaceplate enables the distance between the antenna feed and the GRIN lens to be reduced by almost a factor of two. We find the radiation patterns from a conventional and space-squeezed antenna are very similar, with a very low cross-polarisation, and only a minor increase in the side-lobe levels when introducing the spaceplate. Our work represents a first example of a spaceplate integrated into a functional optical system, highlighting the potential for this concept to reduce the physical size of optical systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Mode Optimisation by Background Anti-Resonance Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To derive the best oscillator phase noise when implementing a high-Q resonator, the spectral line-shape must have high contrast and symmetry. Ideally, this line-shape is Lorentzian, however, in a high mode density spectral region, low-Q background spurious modes interact and distort the resonance. For a sapphire-loaded cavity resonator operating with whispering gallery modes we show that this high contrast and symmetry can be achieved by changing the dimensions of the surrounding cavity shield to tune the background low-Q structures into anti-resonance. This works because the high-Q resonances are primarily defined by the sapphire while the background modes are defined by the cavity shield. Alternatively, it was shown that a similar result can be achieved by exciting the high-Q resonator with a balanced microwave dipole probe in a Mach Zehnder interferometric configuration. The probe was constructed from two separate coaxial electric field probes symmetrically inserted into a cylindrical cavity resonator, from opposite sides with a small gap between them, so they can behave like an active wire dipole antenna. The power into the two separate probes may be matched with an external variable attenuator in one of the arms of the interferometer. Conversely, the phase between the two electric field probes may be changed with an external variable phase shifter, which changes the nature of the field components the probe couples to. The probe couples to the high-Q resonant modes as well as low-Q background modes, which can be made resonant or anti-resonant for the high-Q modes by changing this external phase. When the background modes are in anti-resonance the line shape of the high-Q mode can be made symmetric and with higher contrast. This technique was applied to both whispering gallery sapphire modes, as well as hollow cavity resonators, without changing the dimensions of the cavity.</description>

Abstract: We consider a setup to detect stimulated photon-photon scattering using high-power lasers. Signal photons are emitted from an overlap of the incoming intense laser pulses focused in vacuum from three sides. We derive and justify a general approximate analytical formula for the angular distribution and total yield of such signal photons in terms of the parameters of the incoming pulses, including their intensity, carrier frequencies, durations, focusing, polarizations, mutual orientation and overlap. Using the obtained formula a parametric study of the signal is carried out and optimization is performed.</description>

      <title>Pure State Inspired Lossless Post-selected Quantum Metrology of Mixed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an ensemble of identical pure quantum states that depend on an unknown parameter, recently it was shown that the quantum Fisher information can be losslessly compressed into a subensemble with a much smaller number of samples. However, generalization to mixed states leads to a technical challenge that is formidable to overcome directly. In this work, we avoid such technicality by unveiling the physics of a featured lossless post-selection measurement: while the post-selected quantum state is unchanged, the parametric derivative of the density operator is amplified by a large factor equal to the square root of the inverse of the post-selection success probability. This observation not only clarifies the intuition and essence of post-selected quantum metrology but also allows us to develop a mathematically compact theory for the lossless post-selection of mixed states. We find that if the parametric derivative of the density operator of a mixed state, or alternatively the symmetric logarithmic derivative, vanishes on the support of the density matrix, lossless post-selection can be achieved with an arbitrarily large amplification factor. We exemplify with the examples of superresolution imaging and unitary encoding of mixed initial states. Our results are useful for realistic post-selected quantum metrology in the presence of decoherence and of foundational interests to several problems in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Dual-frequency optical-microwave atomic clocks based on cesium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $^{133}$Cs, which is the only stable cesium (Cs) isotope, is one of the most investigated elements in atomic spectroscopy and was used to realize the atomic clock in 1955. Among all atomic clocks, the cesium atomic clock has a special place, since the current unit of time is based on a microwave transition in the Cs atom. In addition, the long lifetime of the $6{\text{P}}_{3/2}$ state and simple preparation technique of Cs vapor cells have great relevance to quantum and atom optics experiments, which suggests the use of the $6{\text{S}} - 6{\text{P}}$ D2 transition as an optical frequency standard. In this work, using one laser as the local oscillator and Cs atoms as the quantum reference, we realized two atomic clocks in the optical and microwave frequencies, respectively. Both clocks could be freely switched or simultaneously output. The optical clock based on the vapor cell continuously operated with a frequency stability of $3.89 \times {10^{ - 13}}$ at 1 s, decreasing to $2.17 \times {10^{ - 13}}$ at 32 s, which was frequency stabilized by modulation transfer spectroscopy and estimated by an optical comb. Then, applying this stabilized laser for an optically pumped Cs beam atomic clock to reduce the laser frequency noise, we obtained a microwave clock with a frequency stability of $1.84 \times {10^{ - 12}}/\sqrt \tau $, reaching $5.99 \times {10^{ - 15}}$ at $10^5$ s. This study demonstrates an attractive feature for the commercialization and deployment of optical and microwave clocks and will guide further development of integrated atomic clocks with better stability. Thus, this study lays the groundwork for future quantum metrology and laser physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walks and genuine single particle entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-particle entangled states (SPES) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-particle counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail how these protocols can be experimentally realized using single photons, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. These have unparalleled security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Gain-compensated metal cavity modes and a million-fold improvement of Purcell factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a rigorous mode theory for gain-compensated plasmonic dimers, we demonstrate how quality factors and Purcell factors can be dramatically increased, improving the quality factors from 10 to over 26,000 and the peak Purcell factors from around 3000 to over 10 billion. Full three-dimensional calculations are presented for gold dimers in a finite-size gain medium, which allows one to easily surpass fundamental Purcell factor limits of lossy media. Within a regime of linear system response, we show how the Purcell factors are modified from the contributions from the projected local density of states as well as a non-local gain. Further, we show that the effective mode volume and radiative beta factors remain relatively constant, despite the significant enhancement of the Purcell factors.</description>

      <title>Towards nanophotonic optical isolation via inverse design of energy transfer in non-reciprocal media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we generalise the adjoint method of inverse design to nonreciprocal media. As a test case, we use three-dimensional topology optimization via the level-set method to optimise one-way energy transfer for point-like source and observation points. To achieve this we introduce a suite of tools, chiefly what we term the `Faraday-adjoint' method which allows for efficient shape optimization in the presence of magneto-optical media. We carry out an optimization based on a very general equation that we derive for energy transfer in a nonreciprocal medium, and link finite-different time-domain numerics to analytics via a modified Born series generalised to a tensor permittivity. This work represents a stepping stone towards practical nanophotonic optical isolation, often regarded as the `holy grail' of integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Theory of Rayleigh-Brillouin optical activity light scattering applicable to chiral liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been understood that dilute samples of chiral molecules such as rarefied gases should exhibit Rayleigh optical activity. We extend the existing theory by accounting for molecular dynamics and correlations, thus obtaining a more general theory of Rayleigh-Brillouin optical activity applicable to dense samples such as neat liquids.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable collective resonances induced by liquid crystals in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can show multi-resonant response with high Q-factors in the visible range due to multipole coupling. This work suggests that these collective resonances in all-dielectric metasurfaces can be modified if adjacent to an anisotropic liquid crystal medium, opening a new path toward the dynamic metasurface effects. Using numerical full-wave simulations and the multipole decomposition technique for reflection and transmission coefficients we study the influence of the surrounding anisotropic medium on the resonant response of metasurfaces composed of disk-shaped dielectric nanoparticles. First, we consider tuning and switching the resonances induced by the polarization of the incident beam in metasurfaces placed in a medium with different orientations of LC molecules. Secondly, we study the case when the tuning of resonances is carried out by applying an external voltage that changes the orientation of LC molecules and thereby changes the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of directly tuning the resonant response of dielectric metasurfaces in an anisotropic environment, which is important for the development of optical nanodevices with dynamic switching of functional modes in the visible range.</description>

      <title>Myasthenia Gravis Diagnosis with Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02014v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation addresses challenges in diagnosing myasthenia gravis, a condition associated with high mortality rates. Employing the SERS method, blood serum samples were analyzed on quartz glass with implanted gold nanoparticles of about 5 nm. Minuscule dimensions of nanoparticles contribute to the heightened enhancement of Raman signals through interband transitions. The enhanced signals facilitated the detection of peaks observed solely in the blood serum of patients suffering from myasthenia gravis.</description>

      <title>Amoeba Formulation of Non-Bloch Band Theory in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transition in a large interacting driven atomic ensemble in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic ensembles strongly interacting with light constitute rich quantum-optical many-body systems, with the potential for observing cooperative effects and dissipative nonequilibrium phase transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which a driven atomic ensemble in free space, characterized by strong dipole-dipole interactions and large spatial extent, can undergo a superradiant phase transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence. In an atomic array, stationary states that conserve the collective pseudospin exhibit completely cooperative decay and undergo a second-order phase transition in the large atom number limit. In contrast, decay mechanisms on longer timescales that fail to conserve pseudospin can lead to discontinuous first-order phase transition at a critical finite atom number, disrupting cooperation despite sharing many similar observable characteristics. A hallmark of the superradiant phase transition is an abrupt shift from total light reflection off the atoms to rapidly increasing transmission, accompanied by significant quantum fluctuations, as a function of light intensity.</description>
