      <title>Decarbonizing Basic Chemicals Production in North America, Europe, Middle East, and China: a Scenario Modeling Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemicals industry accounts for about 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions today and is among the most difficult industries to abate. We model decarbonization pathways for the most energy-intensive segment of the industry, the production of basic chemicals: olefins, aromatics, methanol, ammonia, and chlor-alkali. Unlike most prior pathways studies, we apply a scenario-analysis approach that recognizes the central role of corporate investment decision making for capital-intensive industries, under highly uncertain long-term future investment environments. We vary the average pace of decarbonization capital allocation allowed under plausible alternative future world contexts and construct least-cost decarbonization timelines by modeling abatement projects individually across more than 2,600 production facilities located in four major producing regions. The timeline for deeply decarbonizing production varies by chemical and region but depends importantly on the investment environment context. In the best-of-all environments, to deeply decarbonize production, annual average capital spending for abatement for the next two to three decades will need to be greater than (and in addition to) historical "business-as-usual" investments, and cumulative investment in abatement projects would exceed $1 trillion. In futures where key drivers constrain investment appetites, timelines for decarbonizing the industry extend well into the second half of the century.</description>

      <title>Automated Trading System for Straddle-Option Based on Deep Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Straddle Option is a financial trading tool that explores volatility premiums in high-volatility markets without predicting price direction. Although deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful approach to trading automation in financial markets, existing work mostly focused on predicting price trends and making trading decisions by combining multi-dimensional datasets like blogs and videos, which led to high computational costs and unstable performance in high-volatility markets. To tackle this challenge, we develop automated straddle option trading based on reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms to handle unpredictability in high-volatility markets. Firstly, we leverage the attention mechanisms in Transformer-DDQN through both self-attention with time series data and channel attention with multi-cycle information. Secondly, a novel reward function considering excess earnings is designed to focus on long-term profits and neglect short-term losses over a stop line. Thirdly, we identify the resistance levels to provide reference information when great uncertainty in price movements occurs with intensified battle between the buyers and sellers. Through extensive experiments on the Chinese stock, Brent crude oil, and Bitcoin markets, our attention-based Transformer-DDQN model exhibits the lowest maximum drawdown across all markets, and outperforms other models by 92.5\% in terms of the average return excluding the crude oil market due to relatively low fluctuation.</description>

      <title>A Linear Pricing Mechanism for Load Management in Day-Ahead Retail Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulators and utilities have been exploring hourly retail electricity pricing, with several existing programs providing day-ahead hourly pricing schedules. At the same time, customers are deploying distributed energy resources and smart energy management systems that have significant flexibility and can optimally follow price signals. In aggregate, these optimally controlled loads can create congestion management issues for distribution system operators (DSOs). In this paper, we describe a new linear pricing mechanism for day-ahead retail electricity pricing that provides a signal for customers to follow to mitigate over-consumption while still consuming energy at hours that are preferential for system performance. We show that by broadcasting a linear price designed for price-signal control of cost-optimizing loads, we can shape customer load profiles to provide congestion management without the need for bi-directional communication or customer bidding programs.</description>

      <title>Elite Formation and Family Structure in Prewar Japan: Evidence from the Who's Who Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a newly constructed individual-level dataset of prewar Japanese elites using the ``Who's Who'' directories published in 1903-1939. Covering approximately the top 0.1\% of the population, the dataset contains rich information on social origin, education, occupation, and family structure. By reconstructing intergenerational links and family networks, we provide descriptive evidence on elite formation and persistence across geography, social groups, and education during institutional transitions. The dataset provides a foundational empirical resource for studying elite reproduction, intergenerational and intergroup mobility, and institutional development during Japan's transition to a modern society.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Elasticity in a Marriage Agency Platform: 2014--2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines monthly matching efficiency in the Japanese marriage market using novel data from IBJ, the country's largest structured matching platform. Unlike administrative or dating app data, IBJ provides full search, dating, and matching logs based on verified profiles and confirmed engagements. Users are highly selected into serious marriage search via costly screening. Covering 3.3% of national marriages annually, the data offer rare behavioral granularity. Using a nonparametric approach, I estimate time-varying matching functions and elasticities. Efficiency rises threefold over time, illustrating how digital intermediation transforms partner search in modern marriage markets.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the global production network from cross-border firm transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical for policy-making and business operations, the study of global supply chains has been severely hampered by a lack of detailed data. Here we harness global firm-level transaction data covering 20m global firms, and 1 billion cross-border transactions, to infer key inputs for over 1200 products. Transforming this data to a directed network, we find that products are clustered into three large groups including textiles, chemicals and food, and machinery and metals. European industrial nations and China dominate critical intermediate products in the network such as metals, common components and tools, while industrial complexity is correlated with embeddedness in densely connected supply chains. To validate the network, we find structural similarities with two alternative product networks, one generated via LLM queries and the other derived by NAFTA to track product origins. We further detect linkages between products identified in manually mapped single sector supply chains, including electric vehicle batteries and semi-conductors. Finally, metrics derived from network structure capturing both forward and backward linkages are able to predict country-product diversification patterns with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Individual utilities of life satisfaction reveal inequality aversion unrelated to political alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse) utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Introducing RobustiPy: An efficient next generation multiversal library with model selection, averaging, resampling, and explainable artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific inference is often undermined by the vast but rarely explored "multiverse" of defensible modelling choices, which can generate results as variable as the phenomena under study. We introduce RobustiPy, an open-source Python library that systematizes multiverse analysis and model-uncertainty quantification at scale. RobustiPy unifies bootstrap-based inference, combinatorial specification search, model selection and averaging, joint-inference routines, and explainable AI methods within a modular, reproducible framework. Beyond exhaustive specification curves, it supports rigorous out-of-sample validation and quantifies the marginal contribution of each covariate. We demonstrate its utility across five simulation designs and ten empirical case studies spanning economics, sociology, psychology, and medicine, including a re-analysis of widely cited findings with documented discrepancies. Benchmarking on ~672 million simulated regressions shows that RobustiPy delivers state-of-the-art computational efficiency while expanding transparency in empirical research. By standardizing and accelerating robustness analysis, RobustiPy transforms how researchers interrogate sensitivity across the analytical multiverse, offering a practical foundation for more reproducible and interpretable computational science.</description>

      <title>Working with AI: Measuring the Applicability of Generative AI to Occupations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.</description>
