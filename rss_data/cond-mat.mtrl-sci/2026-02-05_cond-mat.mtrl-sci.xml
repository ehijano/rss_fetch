      <title>Observation of a structurally driven, reversible topological phase transition in a distorted square net material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials hold immense promise for exhibiting exotic quantum phenomena, yet achieving controllable topological phase transitions remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a structurally driven, reversible topological phase transition in the distorted square net material GdPS, induced via in situ potassium dosing. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first principles calculations, we demonstrate a cascade of topological phases in the sub-surface P layer: from a large, topologically trivial band gap to a gapless Dirac cone state with a 2 eV dispersion, and finally to a two-dimensional topological insulator as inferred from theory. This evolution is driven by subtle structural distortions in the first P layer caused by potassium adsorption, which in turn contribute to the band gap closure and topological phase transition. Furthermore, the ability to manipulate the topology of a sub-surface layer in GdPS offers a unique route for exploring and controlling topological states in bulk materials.</description>

      <title>Electrically and optically active charge carrier traps in silicon-doped few-layer GaSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding defects in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors is essential for advancing their use in next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Here, we apply a combination of various impedance spectroscopy techniques to two-dimensional (2D) vdW GaSe doped with silicon (Si) to reconstruct deep trap states across the full bandgap. Deep-level transient spectroscopy reveals three distinct deep states 0.31, 0.88, and 1.40 eV below the conduction band edge. Complementary deep-level optical spectroscopy and photocapacitance measurements identify three deep states at 1.4 and 1.8 eV below the conduction band edge, and 2.0 eV above the valence band edge, with thermal admittance spectroscopy providing additional verification and further resolving two trap states, at 0.16 eV above the valence band edge and at 0.26 eV below the conduction band edge. By comparing the experimentally extracted ionization energies with the predictions of density functional theory, our results attribute these trap states primarily to Si-related defects and metal vacancies. This work presents a comprehensive defect map of Si-doped GaSe, providing critical insights into carrier trapping mechanisms that are essential for optimizing the design of 2D material-based devices for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and guided assembly of niobium trisulfide nanowires and nanowire chains by chemical vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures of transition metal trichalcogenides (TMT) show unique properties through the combination of their anisotropic bonding and low dimensionality. Scalable synthesis approaches that enable control over the morphology, dimensions, and interfaces of 1D TMTs with other nanoscale materials could allow these properties to be used in novel devices. Here, we report chemical vapor deposition of a 1D TMT, namely niobium trisulfide (NbS3) in the form of nanowires, on different substrates, including bulk substrates (amorphous SiO2/Si and crystalline c-sapphire) and several two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials (graphene, h-BN, CrSBr). We demonstrate high growth yield with axial growth rates of up to 40 micrometer/min and with two different growth modes: short nanowires of rectangular cross-section, and unusual long, "chained nanowires" up to 100 micrometer in length with sawtooth morphology. We discuss a mechanism that accounts for the two morphologies and discuss how the structure can be tuned through substrate choice and growth conditions. We further demonstrate guided assembly at the edges of graphene and h-BN, as well as epitaxial growth on few-layer CrSBr and c-sapphire. These results open pathways to explore scalable synthesis and directed assembly of 1D TMT nanomaterials in unique morphologies.</description>

      <title>Tuning Terahertz Optomechanics of MoS2 Bilayers with Homogeneous In-plane Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous in-plane biaxial tensile strain strengthens the out-of-plane van der Waals interaction in \MoS\ bilayers (BLs) and can be used to fine-tune their terahertz (THz) oscillations. Using ultralow-frequency Raman spectroscopy on hexagonal (2H) and rhombohedral (2R) stacked BLs, we observe a hardening of the interlayer breathing modes originating from a strain-induced Poisson contraction of the vdW separation between the layers, and characterized by an effective out-of-plane Poisson's ratio of $\nu_\mathrm{eff} \approx 0.19\text{--}0.24$. Strikingly, this geometric contraction drives the system into a highly repulsive regime of the intermolecular potential, corresponding to a Gr\"uneisen parameter of $\gamma \approx 10\text{--}14$. This value surpasses even the `giant' one reported for phosphorene, establishing these van der Waals BLs as highly tunable nonlinear mechanical platforms that can be addressed at the THz regime, couple strongly with light, and do not need external pressure knobs.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic assessment of machine learning models for solid-state synthesis prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models have recently emerged to predict whether hypothetical solid-state materials can be synthesized. These models aim to circumvent direct first-principles modeling of solid-state phase transformations, instead learning from large databases of successfully synthesized materials. Here, we assess the alignment of several recently introduced synthesis prediction models with material and reaction thermodynamics, quantified by the energy with respect to the convex hull and a metric accounting for thermodynamic selectivity of enumerated synthesis reactions. A dataset of successful synthesis recipes was used to determine the likely bounds on both quantities beyond which materials can be deemed unlikely to be synthesized. With these bounds as context, thermodynamic quantities were computed using the CHGNet foundation potential for thousands of new hypothetical materials generated using the Chemeleon generative model. Four recently published machine learning models for synthesizability prediction were applied to this same dataset, and the resultant predictions were considered against computed thermodynamics. We find these models generally overpredict the likelihood of synthesis, but some model scores do trend with thermodynamic heuristics, assigning lower scores to materials that are less stable or do not have an available synthesis recipe that is calculated to be thermodynamically selective. In total, this work identifies existing gaps in machine learning models for materials synthesis and introduces a new approach to assess their quality in the absence of extensive negative examples (failed syntheses).</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of CaSnN$_2$: a sustainable alternative for blue LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of CaSnN2 in the wurtzite-based Pna21 structure is calculated using the Quasiparticle Self-consistent (QS)GW$^{BSE}$ method, including ladder diagrams in the screened Coulomb interaction W$^{BSE}$ and is found to have a direct gap of 2.680 eV at {\Gamma}, which corresponds to blue light wavelength of 463 nm and makes it an attractive candidate for sustainable blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), avoiding Ga and In. The valence band maximum has a1 symmetry and gives allowed transitions to the conduction band minimum for light polarized along the c-direction. The valence band splitting is analyzed in terms of symmetry labeling, and the effective mass tensor is calculated for several bands at {\Gamma}. The optical dielectric function, including electron-hole interaction effects is also reported, and the excitons are analyzed, including several dark excitons.</description>

      <title>Decoupling effects of the resistive-switching behavior on the polarization reversal in ultrathin ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HfO2-based ferroelectric films have attracted considerable attention as their nanoscale ferroelectricity and compatibility with cmos technology, fulfilling demands of emerging memory technologies. However, as films scale down, resistive-switching behavior becomes increasingly pronounced, intricately intertwining with the polarization-switching process and affecting ferroelectric switching factors often overlooked yet crucial for device performance optimization. By characterizing resistive-switching behavior and oxygen vacancy motion using tailored electric pulse schemes, we decouple the resistive-switching behavior from the overall switching process in ultrathin ferroelectric HZO films, which would otherwise erroneously inflate polarization values and increase coercive fields. Building on this, we elucidate endurance degradation mechanisms from dual perspectives of resistive switching and defect migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the mitigated resistive switching activity by designing HfO2-based devices with symmetric oxide electrodes, achieving reduced coercive fields and improved cycling performances. This work provides crucial insights into the origins of inflated polarizations and reliability challenges in HfO2-based devices while offering a viable strategy to enhance ferroelectric properties for advanced memory applications.</description>

      <title>Long-range orbital transport and inverse orbital Hall effect in Co/Ru-based terahertz emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy in femtosecond photoexcited spintronic heterostructures has emerged as a versatile tool for investigating ultrafast spin-transport in a noncontact and non-invasive manner. However, the investigation of ultrafast orbital-transport is still in the primitive stage. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the orbital-to-charge current conversion in Co/Ru heterostructures. Time-domain measurements reveal delayed and broadened terahertz waveforms with increasing Ru thickness, consistent with long-range orbital transport. In Co/Pt/Ru trilayers, the terahertz emission is further enhanced through constructive interference between the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in Pt and inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) in Ru, while reversed stack structures show suppressed output. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements reveal a strong correlation between damping and THz amplitude, highlighting efficient angular momentum conversion. These results position Co/Ru as a promising orbitronic platform for tunable ultrafast THz emission. Our results not only strengthen the physical mechanism of condensed matter physics but also pave the way for designing promising spin-orbitronic devices and terahertz emitters.</description>

      <title>Robust, High-Contrast, Recyclable Zinc-Based Dynamic Windows via Synergistic Electrolyte and Interfacial Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc-based electrochromic devices offer a sustainable route for dynamic optical management but are plagued by poor cycling stability due to irreversible zinc plating/stripping and side reactions. Herein, we report a robust, high-contrast, and recyclable zinc-based dynamic window enabled by a synergistic electrolyte and interfacial engineering strategy. Molecular dynamics simulations and electrochemical analyses reveal a dual-ion cooperative mechanism that governs the reversibility: anions with the strongest binding affinity guide uniform Zn deposition by stabilizing the inner solvation shell, while formate anions co-enriched at the interface facilitate smooth stripping via protonation during the oxidation process. This orchestrated interplay effectively eliminates "dead Zn" accumulation and dendrite growth. Consequently, the device demonstrates a record-high lifespan of 15,000 cycles with negligible degradation and maintains a large optical modulation of &gt;50%, along with multiple optical states (transparent, gray, black, and mirror). Furthermore, it achieves a large reflectance modulation (&gt;50%) stable for over 2,000 cycles. This work establishes the recyclable zinc-based dynamic window as a scalable, high-performance alternative to conventional electrochromic systems, advancing the feasibility of solution-processed energy-saving windows in sustainable buildings.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Discovery of Two-Dimensional Materials Exhibiting Strong Rashba-Edelstein effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE), which generates spin accumulation under an applied electric current, quantifies charge-to-spin conversion (CSC) efficiency in non-centrosymmetric systems. However, systematic investigations of REE in two-dimensional (2D) materials remain scarce. To address this gap, we perform a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the 80 crystallographic layer groups, elucidating the relationship between materials' symmetries and the geometric characteristics of the REE response tensor. Our analysis identifies 13 distinct symmetry classes for the tensor and reveals all potential material candidates. Considering the requirement of strong spin-orbit coupling for a large REE response, we screen the C2DB database and identify 54 promising 2D materials. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the largest REE response coefficients in these materials exceed those reported for other 2D systems by an order of magnitude, indicating exceptionally high CSC efficiency. Focusing on three representative materials, including HgI2, AgTlP2Se6 and BrGaTe, we show that their large response coefficients can be well explained by effective kp models and the characteristic spin textures around high-symmetry points in momentum space. This work provides a systematic framework and identifies high-performance candidates, paving the way for future exploration of REE-driven CSC in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Long-lived Carriers in Molybdenum Carbide Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum carbide (MoC) is a promising candidate for substituting expensive platinum-group metals in many applications owing to its low cost and excellent properties. A comprehensive understanding of the carrier dynamics in MoC facilitates its implementations and helps designing synthesis strategies. In this work, the carrier relaxation in MoC nanosheets is investigated by combining femtosecond transient reflection spectroscopy with first-principles calculations. The observed processes of electron-electron, electron-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering show longer lifetimes compared to those of other transition metal carbides. The nanosecond carrier lifetime is explained by the restricted phonon decay pathways induced by the large mass difference between C and Mo atoms, which is revealed through the analysis of calculated phonon dispersion. The slow cooling of hot carriers in MoC nanosheets offers a simple approach for designing devices that effectively utilize hot carriers, which are expected to improve photothermal and photovoltaic performances.</description>

      <title>Flexocurrent-induced magnetization: Strain gradient-induced magnetization in time-reversal symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry constraints determine which physical responses are allowed in a given system. Magnetization induced by strain fields, such as in piezomagnetic and flexomagnetic effects, has typically been considered in materials that break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose that nonuniform strain can induce magnetization even in nonmagnetic metals and semiconductors that preserve time-reversal symmetry. This mechanism differs from the conventional flexomagnetic effect: the strain gradient acts as a driving force on the electrons, generating magnetization in a manner closely analogous to current-induced magnetization. Treating the strain field as an external field, we derive a general expression for the magnetization induced by a strain gradient and demonstrate that this response is symmetry-allowed even in time-reversal symmetric systems. We apply our formulation to nonmagnetic systems that lack spatial inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry, using a decorated square lattice, monolayer MoS$_2$, and monolayer Janus MoSSe as representative examples. We find a finite magnetization response to strain gradients, which is consistent with symmetry arguments, supporting the validity of our theoretical framework. These results offer a pathway for controlling magnetization in nonmagnetic materials using strain fields.</description>

      <title>Revealing the interfacial kinetic mechanisms in high-entropy doped Na$_3$V$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ through electrochemical investigation and distribution of relaxation times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed a high-entropy doped NASICON cathode, Na$_3$V$_{1.9}$(CrMoAlZrNi)$_{0.1}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ and investigate its electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) to understand the diffusion mechanism including distribution of relaxation times analysis of interfacial kinetics. This trace doping induces high-entropy mixing at the vanadium site, tuning the lattice and enhancing specific capacity, activating V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ redox couple 3.95~V. Interestingly, it delivers a reversible capacity of 119~mAh~g$^{-1}$ at 0.1~C, and demonstrate excellent stability of 68\% after 1000 cycles at 10~C. The calculated diffusion coefficient values are found within the range of \(10^{-11}\)--\(10^{-13}~\mathrm{cm^2\,s^{-1}}\). The systematic investigation of temperature and voltage-dependent impedance data using the distribution of relaxation times provides deeper insights into the underlying charge-transfer and transport processes. The full cells with hard carbon delivers 326~Wh~kg$^{-1}$ (with respect to cathode mass) at $\approx$3.2~V and retained $\sim$79\% capacity after 100 cycles at 2~C. Our study opens new avenues for developing high-entropy doped cathodes for enhanced structural stability, extended redox activity, and optimized electrochemical kinetics for practical implementation of SIBs.</description>

      <title>ZnCdO:Eu Epitaxially Grown Alloys for Self-Powered Ultrafast Broadband Photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photodetectors (PDs) are essential in imaging, communication, and sensing technologies. However, their reliance on external power makes them energy-consuming. This creates a strong need for self-powered PDs as a sustainable alternative. ZnO is a promising semiconductor material due to its pyroelectric properties, stemming from non-centrosymmetric wurtzite crystal structure, enabling the pyro-phototronic effect that enhances response speed. Properties of ZnO can be tailored via alloying and doping. Thus, this work explores thin layers of ZnCdO:Eu random alloys grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on silicon substrates, with varying Cd content. The study shows that doping with Eu notably affects growth kinetics, promoting strong [0001] orientation preference. Moreover, photoluminescence measurements confirm the successful incorporation of Eu3+ ions into the structure. Electrical measurements show that the introduction of Cd eliminates the problem of Schottky barrier formation on the ZnO/Si interface. The n-ZnCdO:Eu/p-Si junctions exhibit rectifying behavior and generate photocurrent across 380-1150 nm wavelength range without external electrical bias. Utilizing the pyro-phototronic effect, these devices achieved ultrafast response times: rise time below 10 us and decay time below 5 us for 405 nm and 650 nm illumination - placing them among the fastest self-powered oxide-based detectors that do not rely on additional performance-enhancing layers.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Crystal System Prediction for Perovskites Using Augmented X-ray Diffraction Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of crystal system from X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra is a critical task in materials science, particularly for perovskite materials which are known for their diverse applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and catalysis. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven framework that leverages advanced models, including Time Series Forest (TSF), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a simple feedforward neural network (NN), to classify crystal systems, point groups, and space groups from XRD data of perovskite materials. To address class imbalance and enhance model robustness, we integrated feature augmentation strategies such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), class weighting, jittering, and spectrum shifting, along with efficient data preprocessing pipelines. The TSF model with SMOTE augmentation achieved strong performance for crystal system prediction, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9, an F1 score of 0.92, and an accuracy of 97.76%. For point and space group prediction, balanced accuracies above 95% were obtained. The model demonstrated high performance for symmetry-distinct classes, including cubic crystal systems, point groups 3m and m-3m, and space groups Pnma and Pnnn. This work highlights the potential of ML for XRD-based structural characterization and accelerated discovery of perovskite materials</description>

      <title>Electronic States, Spin-Orbit Coupling and Magnetism in Germanium 60{\deg} Dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors have recently attracted renewed interest owing to their potential in novel quantum applications. Here we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties induced by 60{\deg} dislocations in Ge. Using large-scale DFT calculations, we determine the band structure for both the shuffle and glide sets in their lowest-energy configurations. We also perform charged-defect calculations to aid in the interpretation of complex photoluminescence spectra observed in epitaxial Ge layers. The band structure for the shuffle set reveals defect-induced dispersive bands localized within the band gap near the {\Gamma} point, whereas for the glide set, we observe strong overlap with the conduction band. Defect-induced band splitting evident away from {\Gamma} reveals Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, an effect previously reported only for screw dislocations. Remarkably, we find evidence that specific dislocation arrangements can stabilize antiferromagnetic ordering with sizable local magnetic moments and considerable exchange splitting between opposite spin states. These results uncover rich physics in Ge dislocations through the combination of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic ordering, potentially enabling novel defect-based functionalities in Ge devices.</description>

      <title>Potential-Induced Dynamic Coordination of Nonmetal Atoms Directly Bound to Metal Centers in Graphene-Embedded Single-Atom Catalysts and Its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrode-potential-induced dynamic coordination is an essential factor governing the performance of graphene-embedded single-atom catalysts (SACs). While previous studies have primarily centered on structural dynamics at the metal site, the response of its coordinated nonmetal atoms remains largely unexplored. Here, using Ni SACs with mixed nitrogen/carbon coordination (NiN4-xCx) as representatives, we investigate potential-driven hydrogenation of metal-center-coordinated nonmetallic atoms through constant-potential density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics. We find that the C sites directly bound to Ni undergo potential-driven hydrogenation, whereas hydrogenation at N sites is thermodynamically unfavorable. Taking NiNC3 as a representative system, we demonstrate that these hydrogenation processes proceed with accessible kinetic barriers and obey the Br{\o}nsted-Evans-Polanyi relation. The resulting dynamic coordination reshapes the Ni 3d and dz2 orbitals, modulates the stability of the active center, and weakens molecular adsorption through combined electronic and steric effects. These findings reveal that electrode potential and solvent not only regulate the metal center but also dynamically reconfigure its coordination environment, offering novel mechanistic insights into potential-induced coordination dynamics and guiding the rational design of coordination-engineered SACs.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Polarization-Controlled Magnetization Switching in FePt/BaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric-field driven magnetization switching in FePt/BaTiO$_3$ (001) is demonstrated through first-principles calculations. The magnetic easy axis of FePt layer undergoes a transition from in-plane to perpendicular direction upon ferroelectric polarization reversal, a process sensitively controlled by epitaxial strain with threshold strain strain($\eta$) $\eta\approx\%$. At this phenomena, a large interfacial magnetoelectric coupling ($\alpha_I = 3.6 \times 10^{-10}$ G$\cdot$cm$^2$/V) is responsible, stemming from the orbital reconstruction. In particular, the redistribution of Pt-$d$ orbital occupancy alters spin-orbit coupling, thereby tuning the competition between magnetic anisotropy ($K_i$) and magnetoelastic energy ($b_1$). Our work clarifies the fundamental physics of strain-engineered magnetoelectricity and suggests a concrete pathway for designing ultra-low-power voltage-controlled magnetic memory.</description>

      <title>Strain tunable anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities in compensated ferrimagnetic Mn$_3$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunability of anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities is investigated in the compensated ferrimagnet Mn$_3$Al under isotropic strain ($\eta$) and chemical potential variation using first-principles calculations. At a chemical potential of $\mu = -0.3$ eV, three distinct topological features -- Weyl points, nodal lines, and gapped nodal lines -- are simultaneously realized along high-symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone in the framework of magnetic space group. The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is found to be predominantly governed by the Berry curvature in the $k_y k_z$ plane and can be enhanced significantly under tensile strain, reaching $-1200$ $(\Omega~\mathrm{cm})^{-1}$. On the other hand, the anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) shows a sign change near the Fermi level and whose magnitude increases at $\mu = -0.3$ eV with quasi-quadratic strain dependence. Regardless of strain, the underlying bands and Fermi surface structures remain robust, while the distribution and magnitude of Berry curvature evolve substantially. These results underscore the potential of Mn$_3$Al, a compensated ferrimagnet, as a platform for Berry curvature engineering via strain and doping.</description>

      <title>Triple Junctions as Dislocation-Like Defects: The Role of Grain Boundary Crystallography Revealed by Experiment and Atomistic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary networks and their evolution are strongly influenced by triple junctions. The defect nature of these line defects significantly affects the properties of the network, but they have not been fully characterized to date. Here, we use scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with atomistic computer simulations to investigate a triple junction at the atomic scale in an Al thin film with {111} texture. Using sampling methods, we were able to construct the same junction structure as in the experiment within a computer model. We present a technique to calculate the Burgers vector of the triple junction. This allows us to connect the junction's dislocation character to the microscopic degrees of freedom of the joining grain boundaries. The junction line energy in the computer model can then be calculated using an embedded atom method potential. It follows the same laws as a bulk dislocation. Finally, we discovered a range of possible triple junctions for the observed grain boundaries, which vary in the magnitude of their Burgers vector. Interestingly, the experimentally observed junction is not the one with the smallest possible Burgers vector and energy. This suggests that the kinetics of transforming the junction line are likely too slow to be driven by the small energy contribution of the triple junction.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface geometry and momentum dependent electron-phonon coupling drive the charge density wave in quasi-1D ZrTe$3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZrTe$_3$ is a prototypical quasi-one-dimensional compound undergoing a charge density wave transition via a very sharp Kohn anomaly in phonon momentum space. While Fermi surface geometry has long been considered the primary driver of the instability, a full understanding of the lattice dynamics and electron-phonon role has remained elusive. Our first principles calculations in the high-symmetry phase show that the Fermi surface is correctly reproduced only when the Hubbard interaction on the Te $5p$ orbitals is included, which in turn is essential for the appearance of a soft harmonic phonon mode at the CDW wavevector. Analyzing the mode and momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling, we find that its variations with phonon momentum dominate over electronic effects. These results identify unambiguously the CDW origin in ZrTe$_3$ as a cooperative effect of Fermi surface geometry and momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling, with the latter playing the leading role. The mechanisms revealed in our work are directly relevant to other quasi-1D systems, including trichalcogenides and compounds hosting Peierls-like chains.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal topological kink-wave propagation in mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear mechanical metamaterials can exhibit emergent transport phenomena that mimic topological protection without relying on linear band topology. Here, we realize a bifurcation-induced nonreciprocal lattice that supports robust propagation of elastic kink waves. Each unit is a prestrained, hinged-beam circulator that develops angular momentum bias during snap-through transitions between buckling states, producing an effective breaking of time reversal symmetry. Coupling such units into a hexagonal array yields a mechanically chiral network where localized soliton-like excitations propagate unidirectionally along interfaces and edges, immune to sharp bends. We demonstrate non-dispersive kink transport governed by a SineGordon type field whose effective bias encodes mechanical chirality. This framework bridges bifurcation dynamics and nonreciprocal transport, establishing a nonlinear route toward topological like mechanical functionality without magnetic or gyroscopic bias.</description>

      <title>Automated Extraction of Multicomponent Alloy Data Using Large Language Models for Sustainable Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of sustainable materials requires access to materials performance and sustainability data from literature corpus in an organized, structured and automated manner. Natural language processing approaches, particularly large language models (LLMs), have been explored for materials data extraction from the literature, yet often suffer from limited accuracy or narrow scope. In this work, an LLM-based pipeline is developed to accurately extract alloy-related information from both textual descriptions and tabular data across the literature on high-entropy (or multicomponent) alloys (HEA). Specifically two databases with 37,711 and 148,069 entries respectively are retrieved; one from the literature text, consisting of alloy composition, processing conditions, characterization methods, and reported properties, and other from the literature tables, consisting of property names, values, and units. The pipeline enhances materials-domain sensitivity through prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation and achieves F1-scores of 0.83 for textual extraction and 0.88 for tabular extraction, surpassing or matching existing approaches. Application of the pipeline to over 10,000 articles yields the largest publicly available multicomponent alloy database and reveals compositional and processing-property trends. The database is further employed for sustainability-aware materials selection in three application domains, i.e., lightweighting, soft magnetic, and corrosion-resistant, identifying multicomponent alloy candidates with more sustainable production while maintaining or exceeding benchmark performance. The pipeline developed can be easily generalized to other class of materials, and assist in development of comprehensive, accurate and usable databases for sustainable materials design.</description>

      <title>Structures of iron and cobalt bimetallic clusters for optimized chemical vapor deposition growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate iron-cobalt (Fe-Co) alloys as a representative high-performance catalyst system for SWCNT growth in a systematic manner by combining chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments with chirality-resolved spectroscopic analysis, as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on density functional theory-derived machine learning force fields while varying the Fe-Co ratio. Using zeolite-based SWCNTs prepared by alcohol CVD, absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, together with two-dimensional excitation-emission fitting was employed to quantify chirality-specific growth efficiency. Two distinct growth regimes were identified. At a relatively low temperature of 600 C, pure Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity, promoting efficient growth of small-diameter (0.7-0.9 nm) SWCNTs. In contrast, at 850 C, the Fe0.75Co0.25 alloy shows a pronounced enhancement in growth efficiency compared with pure Fe, pure Co, and other Fe-Co compositions, also yielding larger diameter tubes (0.9-1.1nm). Similar growth behavior was observed on SiO2 substrates, enabling detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis of catalyst nanoparticles. Electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that high SWCNT yields correlate with the formation of small, uniform Fe-Co nanoparticles with Co-enriched surfaces, in excellent agreement with MD simulations. Lastly, MD results are summarized in a composition-diameter phase diagram that rationalizes the experimentally observed growth trends. The exceptional performance of the Fe0.75Co0.25 catalyst at high temperature is attributed to the stabilization of small and uniform catalyst clusters, providing mechanistic insight into the synergistic roles of alloy composition and temperature in SWCNT growth.</description>

      <title>Cross-sectional helium irradiation reveals interface-controlled bubble evolution in Cr/CrAlSiN multilayer coatings on zirconium alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irradiation stability of Cr based protective coatings on zirconium alloys is critical for the development of accident-tolerant fuel claddings. However, conventional surface irradiation often produces shallow, nonuniform damage, obscuring interfacial behavior. In this study, we perform cross-sectional He irradiation to directly examine the interfacial response and He bubble evolution across Cr monolayer and Cr and CrAlSiN multilayer coatings on Zr substrates. Irradiation was carried out at 500 C and 750 C to doses of 2 and 3 dpa, enabling a direct comparison of temperature-dependent microstructural evolution. In the Cr monolayer, He implantation produced a homogeneous distribution of nanoscale bubbles throughout the damaged region and large cavities at the Cr and Zr interface, indicating severe Kirkendall-type voiding and interfacial decohesion at elevated temperature. In contrast, the Cr/CrAlSiN multilayer exhibited a periodically modulated bubble distribution, with bubble fragmentation and transformation into nanoscale platelets at CrAlSiN interfaces. A N-enriched Zr(N) interlayer formed spontaneously at the CrAlSiN and Zr interface, effectively suppressing bubble accumulation and interdiffusion. The nanochannel interfaces acted as He sinks and diffusion barriers, enhancing interfacial bonding and mitigating swelling. This work demonstrates that cross-sectional ion irradiation is a powerful approach for probing interfacial stability in multilayer systems, offering new insights into He-defect interactions and radiation tolerance engineering at buried interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of Cr and CrAlSiN multilayers as advanced coating architectures for high-temperature nuclear environments.</description>

      <title>Scalar machine learning of tensorial quantities -- Born effective charges from monopole models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting tensorial properties with machine learning models typically requires carefully designed tensorial descriptors. In this work, we introduce an alternative strategy for learning tensorial quantities based on scalar descriptors. We apply this approach to the Born effective charge tensor, showing that scalar (monopole) kernel models can successfully capture its tensorial nature by exploiting the definition of the Born effective charge tensor as the derivative of the polarisation with respect to atomic displacements. We compare this method with tensorial (dipole) kernel models, as established in our previous work, in which the tensorial structure of the Born effective charge is encoded directly in the kernel and obtained via its derivative. Both approaches are then used for charge partitioning, enabling the separation of monopole and dipole contributions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by computing finite-temperature infrared spectra for a range of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Atomistic and data-driven insights into the local slip resistances in random refractory multi-principal element alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) have attracted growing interest for their exceptional high-temperature strength, yet their complex compositions hinder a mechanistic understanding of plastic deformation. Here, we perform atomistic simulations to determine local slip resistances (LSRs) of edge and screw dislocations on primary BCC slip planes in 12 equal-molar RMPEAs. Machine learning is employed to uncover relationships between LSR and underlying material properties, enabling systematic assessment of compositional effects on dislocation behavior. Based on these insights, we develop a thermally activated, dislocation-based model to predict macroscopic yield stress. We find that increasing the fraction of hexagonal close-packed elements above 50% significantly reduces unstable stacking fault energy, ideal shear strength, and screw LSR across all slip planes. Higher elastic anisotropy further lowers these quantities, while lattice distortion modifies relative slip resistances between dislocation characters and slip systems. By combining an autoencoder with a random forest model, we identify elastic constants and lattice distortion as the dominant factors controlling LSR. The resulting framework accurately predicts tensile yield stress in BCC RMPEAs and provides guidance for alloy design.</description>

      <title>Observation of Highly Efficient Torques on Orbital Moments Induced by Orbital Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the current-induced torques in bilayers composed of a light 3d metal, chromium, and a rare-earth ferromagnet with finite orbital moments, terbium, utilizing second-harmonic Hall-response measurements. The dampinglike torque efficiency of chromium is found to be positive and reaches ~3.66 in this system, in sharp contrast to the negative and subtle dampinglike torque efficiency in general Cr/ferromagnet heterostructures with quenched orbital moment. We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Scalable platform enabling reservoir computing with nanoporous oxide memristors for image recognition and time series prediction</title>

Abstract: Typical mammal brains have some form of random connectivity between neurons. Reservoir computing, a neural network approach, uses random weights within its processing layer along with built-in recurrent connections and short-term, fading memory, and is shown to be time and training efficient in processing spatiotemporal signals. Here we prepared a niobium oxide-based thin film memristor device with intrinsic structural in-homogeneity in the form of random nanopores and performed computational tasks of XOR operations, image recognition, and time series prediction and reconstruction. For the latter task we chose a complex three-dimensional chaotic Lorenz-63 time series. By applying three temporal voltage waveforms individually across the device and training the readout layer with electrical current signals from a three-output physical reservoir, we achieved satisfactory prediction and reconstruction accuracy in comparison to the case of no reservoir. This work highlights the potential for scalable, on-chip devices using all-oxide reservoir systems, paving the way for energy-efficient neuromorphic electronics dealing with time signals.</description>

      <title>DMFlow: Disordered Materials Generation by Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics substantially affects induced structure formation in magnetic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetorheological fluids consist of micrometer-sized magnetic particles in a carrier liquid. Sufficiently strong external magnetic fields lead to the formation of string-like particle aggregates. We demonstrate that hydrodynamic interactions, that is, mutual couplings via induced flows, play a substantial role during structure formation. Hydrodynamics supports the emergence of string-like aggregates, while magnetic interactions align them. This fundamental insight is substantial from an application perspective, due to the enormous technical importance and potential of magnetorheological fluids.</description>

      <title>From Evaluation to Design: Using Potential Energy Surface Smoothness Metrics to Guide Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Phonon selection and interference in momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09792v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal is necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches in some measurements. Simultaneous sampling of the lattice across all basis atoms also warrants a coherent treatment of phonons, which yields a reciprocal-space repeating unit cell that is larger than the standard Brillouin zone. We thus introduce the concept of the ``interferometric Brillouin zone'' where phonons are observed, which is closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor. These effects follow from our new mathematical formalism for waves and vibrations, and we demonstrate calculations of q-EELS experiments using molecular dynamics and lattice dynamics. Results are compared to established q-EELS simulation methods in well-studied material systems, including the utilization of scattering selection rules to acquire a polarization-selective vibrational density of states. Finally, we note the analysis involved is directly applicable to any wave phenomena, such as plasmons or polaritons.</description>

      <title>Indium selenides for next-generation low-power computing devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (&gt;2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.</description>

      <title>PhaseT3M: 3D Imaging at 1.6 {\AA} Resolution via Electron Cryo-Tomography with Nonlinear Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) enables 3D imaging of complex, radiation-sensitive structures with molecular detail. However, image contrast from the interference of scattered electrons is nonlinear with atomic density and multiple scattering further complicates interpretation. These effects degrade resolution, particularly in conventional reconstruction algorithms, which assume linearity. Particle averaging can reduce such issues but is unsuitable for heterogeneous or dynamic samples ubiquitous in biology, chemistry, and materials sciences. Here, we develop a phase retrieval-based cryo-ET method, PhaseT3M. We experimentally demonstrate its application to a ~7 nm Co3O4 nanoparticle on ~30 nm carbon substrate, achieving a maximum resolution of 1.6 {\AA}, surpassing conventional limits using standard cryo-TEM equipment. PhaseT3M uses a multislice model for multiple scattering and Bayesian optimization for alignment and computational aberration correction, with a positivity constraint to recover 'missing wedge' information. Applied directly to biological particles, it enhances resolution and reduces artifacts, establishing a new standard for routine 3D imaging of complex, radiation-sensitive materials.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Enhanced Amplified Spontaneous Emission in Solvent-Engineered MAPbBr$_3$ Films</title>

Abstract: The high-pressure behavior of 3D metal halide chalcogenides (MHPs) has been widely studied. In the field of high-pressure technology, the studies on 3D MHPs have focused on the structural and optical properties, where the optical properties are mainly investigated on the photoluminescence behavior, while the laser properties of the materials have not been studied yet. In this paper, MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films with ionic liquid methylammonium acetate (MAAc) as solvent and conventional MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents were prepared using solvent engineering method. In-situ pressurization testing of both materials using a small-cavity hydrostatic high-pressure device (DAC) was used to investigate the high-pressure optical behavior of the MAPbBr$_3$ films, especially the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties, which, combined with high-pressure in-situ Raman, revealed that the changes in the optical properties of the films under pressure are due to the changes in the crystal structure of the materials. This paper also emphasizes that the optical properties and phase structure stability of MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films are superior to those of MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films under high pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it achieves predictive performance that is comparable to or exceeds that of state-of-the-art black-box models and consistently outperforms existing white-box symbolic regression methods. The resulting expressions provide physical insights; for example, in the oxygen-ion conductor problem, they elucidate oxygen-ion transport in terms of the coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Crossover between intrinsic and temperature-assisted regimes in spin-orbit torque switching of antiferromagnetic order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensive studies have been made on antiferromagnets as candidate materials for next generation memory bits due to their ultrafast dynamics reaching picosecond time scales. Recent demonstrations of electrical bidirectional switching of antiferromagnetic states have attracted significant attention. However, under the presence of significant Joule heating that destabilizes the magnetic order, the timescales associated with the switching can be limited to nanoseconds or longer. Here, we present the observation of a crossover in the switching behavior of the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn by tuning the magnetic layer thickness. While Joule heating interferes with switching in thicker devices, we find clear signatures of an intrinsic spin-orbit torque mechanism as the thickness is reduced, avoiding the heating effect. The suppression of heating enables switching without significant attenuation of the readout signal using pulses shorter than those required by temperature-assisted mechanisms. The crossover into the spin-orbit torque switching behavior clarifies the potential for achieving ultrafast switching as expected from the picosecond spin dynamics of antiferromagnets. Our results lay the groundwork for designing antiferromagnetic memory devices that can operate at ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large chemical tunability and strong light-matter interactions make colloidal transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanostructures particularly suitable for light-emitting applications. However, ultrafast exciton decay and quenched photoluminescence (PL) limit their potential. Combining femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with first-principles calculations on MoS2 and WS2 nanoplatelets, we reveal that the observed sub-picosecond exciton decay originates from edge-located optically bright hole traps. These intrinsic trap states stem from the metal d-orbitals and persist even when the sulfur-terminated edges are hydrogen-passivated. Notably, WS2 nanostructures show more localized and optically active edge states than their MoS2 counterparts, and zigzag edges exhibit a higher trap density than armchair edges. The nanoplatelet size dictates the competition between ultrafast edge-trapping and slower core-exciton recombination, and the states responsible for exciton quenching enhance catalytic activity. Our work represents an important step forward in understanding exciton quenching in TMD nanoplatelets and stimulates additional research to refine physicochemical protocols for enhanced PL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zinc sulphide (ZnS) is a non-toxic, wide-bandgap II-VI semiconductor with well-established optoelectronic properties. In this work, ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using polymer-assisted wet-chemical routes, namely hydrothermal processing and room-temperature co-precipitation. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were employed as capping agents to investigate their influence on particle growth, dispersion, and optical behaviour. Room-temperature co-precipitation produced ZnS QDs with crystallite sizes as small as 2.03 nm, whereas hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature resulted in larger crystallites exceeding approximately 6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of cubic zinc-blende ZnS in all samples, with peak broadening and minor lattice parameter variations associated with nanoscale dimensions. UV-visible absorption spectra exhibited systematic shifts in the absorption edge, with optical bandgap values ranging from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, consistent with size-dependent quantum confinement effects. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements verified effective polymer capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing stronger growth suppression and improved dispersion compared to PEG. These results provide insight into the role of polymer-nanocrystal interactions in wet-chemical synthesis and demonstrate how synthesis route and polymer chemistry influence the structural and optical properties of ZnS nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Systematic Error in Thin Film Conductivity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Purely Electronic Chirality without Structural Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of purely electronic chirality (PEC), which arises in the absence of structural chirality. In condensed matter physics and chemistry, chirality has conventionally been understood as a mirror-image asymmetry in crystal or molecular structures. We demonstrate that certain electronic orders exhibit chirality-related properties without atomic displacement. Specifically, we investigate quadrupole orders to realize such purely electronic chirality with handedness that can be tuned by magnetic fields. As a representative example, we analyze a model featuring $120^circ$ antiferro quadrupole orders on a distorted kagom\'e lattice, predicting various chirality-related responses in the nonmagnetic ordered phase of URhSn. Furthermore, as a phonon analog, chiral phonons can emerge in achiral crystals through coupling with the PEC order. Our results provide a distinct origin of chirality and a fundamental basis for exploring the interplay between electronic and structural chirality.</description>

      <title>Mechanically concealed holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider this effect from a macroscopic continuum perspective down to atomistic scales. For this purpose, we focus on the basic continuum example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under compressive plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes simply by adjusting the thickness of the surrounding shells, with no need to change the materials. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic levels using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. These extensions attest the robustness of our predictions down to atomistic scales. Thus, they open a straightforward possibility to adjust the strategy of mechanical cloaking via atomistic manipulations. From both perspectives, the underlying concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</description>

      <title>Beyond spin-1/2: Multipolar spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric crystals with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a symmetry-adapted multipolar $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory close to the bulk $\Gamma$ point for time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric $C_{3v}$ crystals in the strong atomic spin-orbit-coupling ($jj$-coupling) limit. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j&gt;1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>
