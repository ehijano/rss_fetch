      <title>Glassy polymers' strain-hardening moduli scale with their statistical-segment volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that a widely-accepted theoretical prediction for glassy-polymeric strain hardening moduli ($G_R \propto \rho_e$, where $\rho_e$ is the entanglement density) fails badly for semiflexible polymers with $N_e \lesssim 4C_\infty$. By postulating that the length, energy and strain scales controlling $G_R$ are the Kuhn length $\ell_K$ and statistical segment length $b = \sqrt{\ell_0 \ell_K}$ (where $\ell_0$ is the backbone bond length), the intermonomer binding energy $u_0$, and the incremental elastic strain $S_{\rm c}$ required to activate Kuhn-segment-scale plastic rearrangements, we develop a scaling theory predicting that $G_R = S_{\rm c}(u_0/\ell_0^3) b^3$ in the athermal limit. This prediction agrees quantitatively (semi-quantitatively) with simulated $G_R$ values for both flexible and semiflexible polymer glasses subjected to athermal uniaxial-stress extension (constant-volume simple shear), over a range of $\ell_K/\ell_0$ that is wider than that spanned by real systems.</description>

      <title>Computer Simulation of Gel Formation in Colloidal Systems of Sticky Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and validate a simulation framework for colloidal gelation. We first reproduce the benchmark results of Santos, Campanella, and Carignano for spherical, gel-forming particles, then extend the methodology to more complex systems of ``sticky'' spherocylindrical rods interacting via a Kihara-like potential. Using comprehensive parameter sweeps documented for reproducibility, we analyze the emergence of porous, percolating networks and conduct a topological characterization of the resulting microstructures. This characterization leverages Early TDA to extract multiscale connectivity features and to define topology-driven metrics for automated comparison between simulations and experiments. Our simulations reveal a clear dependence of network formation on rod aspect ratio and particle density, consistent with established theory and, to our knowledge, not previously demonstrated for spherocylindrical colloids with Kihara-type interactions. Rheological probing of the simulated systems shows signatures characteristic of gels, which supports the structural analysis. We further compare our computational results with experimental data obtained on Bastian Trepka's gels collected by Jacob Steindl. Although these first comparisons indicate that the present model is not yet sufficient to quantitatively describe those specific gelled systems, the agreement in qualitative trends and the robustness of our tools suggest strong potential. Overall, the work demonstrates functional, extensible methods for simulating gelation in rod-based colloids, provides topological data analysis based metrics that can aid automated comparison between experiments and simulations, and outlines several promising directions for future refinement and application.</description>

      <title>Molecular insight on ultra-confined ionic transport in wetting films: the key role of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanofluidic transport is ubiquitous in natural systems from extra-cellular communication in biology to geological phenomena, and promotes the emergence of new technologies such as energy harvesting and water desalination. While experimental access to ultraconfined fluids has advanced rapidly, their behavior challenges conventional theoretical descriptions based on Poisson-Boltzmann theory or the Stokes equation whose possible extension remains an open question. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ionic transport within wetting films of water confined on silica surfaces down to the sub-nanometer scale. We then analyze these results using a simple one-dimensional theoretical framework. Remarkably, we show that this model remains valid even at confinement close to the molecular scale. Our results reveal that the dynamic of ion plays a key role in ionic transports, through ion adsorption at the water-silica interface. Adsorbed cations do not participate in ionic conduction, but instead generate molecular-scale roughness and transmit additional frictional forces to the substrate. This mechanism produces an apparent viscosity increase in electrostatically driven flows, reaching up to four times the bulk value in the case of potassium. Our findings highlight the critical role of interfacial ion adsorption in nanoscale hydrodynamics and provide new insights for interpreting experiments and designing nanofluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of the effect of the relative mobilities of chemical components on the Non solvent induced phase separation process for membrane elaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The filtration membranes are often elaborated through a phase separation process where a polymer rich phase and a polymer poor phase spontaneously form through spinodal decomposition. One process that is still not well understood from a theoretical point of view is the Non-Solvent induced phase separation where a thermodynamically stable film of a a polymer mixture is put in contact with a bad solvent of the polymer. The invasion of the film by this non-solvent drives the film out of stability and leads to spinodal decomposition. During this phase separation polymer poor and polymer rich regions form. In this article we present a numerical study of the effect of kinetic coefficients: namely the relative mobilities of polymer and solvent/non-solvent on the observed patterns. Using 2D numerical simulations of the ternary Cahn-Hilliard model we show that for a given thermodynamic landscape, this parameter has dramatic effects: depending on its value phase separation can be observed or not. We also show that it can affect the nature of the observed pattern. In addition analysing 3D simulations we analyse the final pattern using a quantitative indicator of its connectivity and show that for a wide range of initial composition of the film the final pattern is bicontinuous. We also quantify the transport properties of both polymer rich and polymer poor domains.</description>

      <title>Polyampholyte model of ion clusters: double-layer interactions in the presence of dissociated simple salt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore interactions between equally charged surfaces, in the presence of simple salt and either neutral or monovalently charged polyampholytes. We consider the possibility of using these charged polymers as crude models of ion clusters. The latter have been hypothesised to form in concentrated aqueous salt solutions, and are possibly related to anomalous underscreening. This phenomenon usually manifests itself by unexpectedly strong and long-ranged effective forces at very high ionic strengths. If ion clusters are formed, they are expected to carry at most a weak net charge. Keeping this in mind, we investigate how polyampholyte chains mediate interactions between charged surfaces. A significant amount of simple salt is also present, in most cases. We highlight that if the charges of the polyampholytes are unevenly distributed, there is a polarisation response that in turn can generate very strong and long-ranged surface forces, even at rather high concentrations of simple salt. Aside from their possible relevance to ion clusters and underscreening phenomena, these results also suggest the possibility of tailoring synthetic polyampholytes, in order to regulate colloidal stability.</description>

      <title>DoS Dos and Don'ts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) rheometry is a well-established method for measuring the extensional rheology of low-viscosity liquids. However, clear guidelines on the capabilities and limitations of the technique are lacking. In the present work, we define operational limits for measuring a transient extensional viscosity directly from observation of the rate of filament thinning, as well as model-based bounds on calculating a viscosity $\eta$ and extensional relaxation time $\tau_E$ of a liquid using DoS. Dilute solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyacrylamide (PAM) are used to probe the lower limit of measurable $\tau_E$, demonstrating that values as low as 0.1 ms can be resolved, provided (a) the intrinsic Deborah number (based on the ratio of the relaxation time and the Rayleigh breakup time scale) is $De \geq \mathcal{O}(0.1)$ and (b) an instrumental constraint related to spatial and temporal resolution is satisfied. This instrumental constraint is quantified through a new metric we define as the \textit{filament capture rate}, a ``figure of merit'' (expressed in Hz) that can be used to quantify the number of data points within the elasto-capillary regime that are available for extraction of $\tau_E$. We also investigate the sensitivity to other experimental parameters including variations in nozzle radius and Bond number ($Bo$). Across the tested range ($0.2 &lt; Bo &lt; 0.7$), extensional relaxation times for the same fluid vary by less than $\pm16$ \%; however, experiments with low viscosity fluids at $Bo &gt; 0.5$ exhibit damped gravitational oscillations that affect early-time dynamics. Collectively, these results provide a quantitative roadmap for reliable DoS rheometry and affirm its use for measuring sub-millisecond relaxation times in weakly elastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Quantum Jump Approach for Photosynthetic Energy Transfer with Chemical Reaction and Fluorescence Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based computational method for soft matter dynamics: Deep Onsager-Machlup method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A deep learning-based computational method is proposed for soft matter dynamics -- the deep Onsager-Machlup method (DOMM). It combines the brute forces of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the fundamental physics principle -- Onsager-Machlup variational principle (OMVP). In the DOMM, the trial solution to the dynamics is constructed by DNNs that allow us to explore a rich and complex set of admissible functions. It outperforms the Ritz-type variational method where one has to impose carefully-chosen trial functions. This capability endows the DOMM with the potential to solve rather complex problems in soft matter dynamics that involve multiple physics with multiple slow variables, multiple scales, and multiple dissipative processes. Actually, the DOMM can be regarded as an extension of the deep Ritz method (DRM) developed by E and Yu that uses DNNs to solve static problems in physics. In this work, as the first step, we focus on the validation of the DOMM as a useful computational method by using it to solve several typical soft matter dynamic problems: particle diffusion in dilute solutions, and two-phase dynamics with and without hydrodynamics. The predicted results agree very well with the analytical solution or numerical solution from traditional computational methods. These results show the accuracy and convergence of DOMM and justify it as an alternative computational method for solving soft matter dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neural optimization of the most probable paths of 3D active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques.</description>
