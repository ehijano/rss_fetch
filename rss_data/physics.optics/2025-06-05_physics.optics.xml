      <title>Taking advantage of multiple scattering for Optical Reflection Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Diffraction Tomography (ODT) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique widely used in biological and medical applications. While significant progress has been made in transmission configuration, reflection ODT remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. We present a novel optimization algorithm for 3D refractive index (RI) reconstruction in reflection-mode microscopy. Our method takes advantage of the multiply-scattered waves that are reflected by uncontrolled background structures and that illuminate the foreground RI from behind. It tackles the ill-posed nature of the problem using weighted time loss, positivity constraints and Total Variation regularization. We have validated our method with data generated by detailed 2D and 3D simulations, demonstrating its performance under weak scattering conditions and with simplified forward models used in the optimization routine for computational efficiency. In addition, we highlight the need for multi-wavelength analysis and the use of regularization to ensure the reconstruction of the low spatial frequencies of the foreground RI.</description>

      <title>Optical Physics-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz, dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with 20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus 1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence, opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Ultrafast Thermal Metamaterial Pixel Arrays by Dual-Gate Graphene Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal signatures represent ubiquitous infrared appearances of objects, carrying their unique spectral fingerprints. Despite extensive efforts to decipher and manipulate thermal-infrared signals, the ability to fully control them across spatial, temporal and spectral domains remains a significant challenge due to the slow speed, diffuse and broadband emitting nature of thermal emission in most materials. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable ultrafast thermal metamaterial pixel array that integrates active metasurfaces with dual-gate graphene transistors (Gr-FETs). The Gr-FETs with dual-gate control in each pixel achieve the heater-switch dual functionalities. As broadband transparent microheaters, Gr-FETs support the arbitrary design of integrated metasurfaces to achieve multi-color, narrowband infrared emission and operate at ultrafast modulation speeds. Concurrently as electrical switches, they enable a unified control scheme for pixel arrays of various sizes over large areas without compromising emission intensity. By decoupling the thermal generation and emission design processes, our approach provides an unprecedented degree of flexibility in programming thermal output across space, time, and wavelength. Our fabricated thermal pixel array experimentally demonstrated 26 alphabetical letters by applying progressive scanning, thus paving the way for practical realization of universal thermal signature controls for advanced thermal-infrared applications.</description>

      <title>Rigorous theory of coupled resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the general failure of the famous concept of tight binding and mode hybridization underlying modern theories of coupled open resonators. In spite of sophisticated examples in the literature, successfully illustrating these theories, the latter fail to describe any planar systems. This includes the simplest possible case of two dielectric slabs placed next to each other or separated by a distance, which is straightforward for verification, due to its analytical solvability. We present a rigorous theory capable of calculating correctly the eigenmodes of arbitrary three-dimensional dispersive coupled resonators in terms of their individual modes, providing insight into the proper mode hybridization and formation of bonding and antibonding supermodes. Planar optical resonators, such as coupled slabs and Bragg-mirror microcavities, are used for illustrative purposes as they allow precise and reliable verification of the theory.</description>

      <title>Fresnel reflection coefficients in the Fourier domain for a planar surface in uniform motion parallel to its interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical reflection coefficient of a dielectric medium moving uniformly in the plane spanned by its surface is rigorously calculated using classical electrodynamics and special relativity, and expressed in the Fourier domain, as a function of the incident frequency and wavevector, valid in both the far- and near-field regimes. It is found that cross-polarisation appears as a consequence of the motion, except when it is directed along the plane of incidence. As an example, using a Drude model for the permittivity of the surface at rest, the dispersion relation of its surface modes is calculated. A tilting of the dispersion relation is observed, leading to movement-induced surface plasmon unidirectionality and non-reciprocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new design of a microwave-range ENZ metamaterial consisting of rods with an obround cross-section is proposed. The plasma frequency of the metamaterial can be tuned by rotating the constituent meta-atoms. Tunability of the plasma frequency by 26% is demonstrated both experimentally and numerically. The observed tuning range is dramatically higher than in the one observed in natural materials at optical range.</description>

      <title>Virtual Polarization Elements for Spatially Varying Jones Matrix Transformations on a Free-Space Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control over the spatial and polarization properties of light is foundational for advanced photonic systems, yet most conventional approaches are constrained to local, contact-based manipulation at physical interfaces. To overcome these constraints, here we introduce a fundamentally new framework for action-at-a-distance polarization control using virtual polarization elements (VPEs). VPEs apply prescribed local Jones matrix transformations between an input field at the modulation plane and an output field at a remote, contactless free-space plane, enabling polarization transformations without physical interaction at the target. We demonstrate VPEs, in metasurface platform, realizing diverse polarization functionalities, including single-function VPEs for circular polarizer, linear polarizer, half-wave plate, and quarter-wave plate operations; a multifunction VPE simultaneously implementing distinct polarization functions with arbitrary phase difference across spatial regions; and vortex waveplate configurations generating structured vector vortex beams. By decoupling the modulation and target planes, VPEs open new opportunities for remote polarization shaping, non-invasive beam engineering, and contactless polarization manipulation in challenging optical environments.</description>

      <title>Velocity-modulated drag-trapping of nanoparticles by moving fringe pattern in hollow-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report optical trapping and transport at atmospheric pressure of nanoparticles in a moving interference pattern in hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. Unlike in previous work at low pressure, when the viscous drag forces are weak and the particles travel at the fringe velocity, competition between trapping and drag forces causes the particle velocity to oscillate as it is momentarily captured and accelerated by each passing fringe, followed by release and deceleration by viscous forces. As a result the average particle velocity is lower than the fringe velocity. An analytical model of the resulting motion shows excellent agreement with experiment. We predict that nanoparticles can be trapped at field nodes if the fringes are rocked to and fro sinusoidally-potentially useful for reducing the exposure of sensitive particles to trapping radiation. The high precision of this new technique makes it of interest for example in characterizing nanoparticles, exploring viscous drag forces in different gases and liquids, and temperature sensing.</description>

      <title>Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Non-Rayleigh Speckles Generated from Nonlinear Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically derive an expression for a speckle field's intensity probability density function (PDF) in a nonlinear medium. The analytically driven results are in good agreement with the numerical outcomes. In a focusing nonlinear medium, the local intensity of the speckle is enhanced as manifested through the longer tail of the PDF. In contrast, the local intensity of speckle is reduced in the presence of a defocusing nonlinearity, and the tail of the probability density function also reduces. This change in local intensity of the speckles arises due to the cubic Kerr nonlinearity, which eventually modifies the second-order statistics. Hence, the intensity correlation is altered as per the nature of the associated nonlinearity while the field correlation remains invariant of both types of the nonlinear conditions.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency compact optical transmitter with a total bit energy of 0.78 pJ/bit including silicon slow-light modulator and open-collector current-mode driver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing datacenter demands require power-efficient optical interconnects. However, a conventional standard transmitter using a silicon rib-waveguide Mach-Zehnder modulator and voltage-mode driver has low efficiency and consumes watt-class high power and occupies a several-square-millimeter footprint, which limits large-scale integration for parallel transmission. This paper presents a transmitter consisting of a compact photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) modulator and a current-mode open-collector driver. The PCW modulator is designed to have high impedance in addition to the slow-light effect. The driver connected to the modulator without termination resistors is optimized based on electronics-photonics co-simulations using a standard electronic circuit simulator with an in-house photonic model library. Co-packaging these dramatically reduces the power consumption to 50 mW and a bit energy to 0.78 pJ/bit at 64-Gbaud, and the footprint to 0.66 mm2. This result represents a significant advancement toward the integration of a large number of transmission channels with no temperature control.</description>

      <title>Organic Crystal Active Waveguide as an All-Angle Signal Receiver and Transmission Platform for Visible Light Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic crystal waveguides, known for excellent light-guiding and photonic versatility, present a promising alternative to conventional optical media in visible light communication (VLC) systems. In a novel approach, the high photoluminescence quantum yield organic crystal 2,2dash-((1E,1Edash)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))diphenol (SAA) is used as an optical waveguide medium for real-time data communication in the visible range, employing a microcontroller unit with on off keying modulation. Leveraging its spectral properties, the SAA crystal demonstrates dual active and passive waveguiding capabilities for signal modulation. Error-free signal detection is achieved thanks to the smooth, defect-free surface morphology of the crystal. The relationship between incident angle and light intensity reveals stable fluorescence under narrow angle excitation, positioning the crystal as an all-angle signal receiver that surpasses conventional optical fibers. A real time data transfer setup is demonstrated, enabling direct transmission from a serial interface and accurate reconstruction of grayscale images. This represents the first implementation of a fully organic crystal-based VLC platform, integrating wavelength conversion, omnidirectional waveguiding, and real time signal processing. The results establish a foundation for compact, efficient, and integrable photonic communication technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-intensity laser systems present unique measurement and optimization challenges due to their high complexity, low repetition rates, and shot-to-shot variations. We discuss recent developments towards a unified framework based on information theory and Bayesian inference that addresses these challenges. Starting from fundamental constraints on the physical field structure, we recently demonstrated how to capture complete spatio-temporal information about individual petawatt laser pulses. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate how Bayesian frameworks can leverage temporal correlations between consecutive pulses to improve measurement precision. We then extend these concepts to active sensing strategies that adaptively select measurements to maximize information gain, exemplified through Bayesian autocorrelation spectroscopy. Finally, we show how these information-optimal measurement principles naturally extend to Bayesian optimization. This progression represents a paradigm shift where measurement devices transition from passive data collectors to active participants in complex experiments.</description>

      <title>Exciton-polaritons in a monolayer semiconductor coupled to van der Waals dielectric nanoantennas on a metallic mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons in nanophotonic structures have attracted long-standing interest owing to their fundamental importance and potential for applications in nonlinear and quantum optics. Nanoantennas (NAs) made from high refractive index dielectrics offer a suitable platform for polariton physics thanks to the strongly confined optical Mie resonances and low optical losses in contrast to metallic NAs. However, Mie modes are mainly confined within the NA, making inefficient their coupling with excitons in materials deposited externally. Here, we overcome this limitation by using a high-refractive index van der Waals material WS$_2$, which allows straightforward fabrication of NAs on gold. The combination of a 27 nm tall WS$_2$ NA and a gold substrate enables strong modification of the Mie mode distribution and field enhancement inside and in the vicinity of the NA. This allows observation of room-temperature Mie-polaritons (with a Rabi splitting above 80 meV) arising from the strong coupling between Mie modes and the exciton in a monolayer WSe$_2$ placed on WS$_2$/gold NAs. We demonstrate strong nonlinearity of Mie-polaritons, one order of magnitude higher than for excitons in monolayer WSe$_2$ on gold.

      <title>A comparative study of focusing with scalar and vector beams in an active Raman gain system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the focusing characteristics of scalar and vector beams within an atomic medium. An active-Raman-gain configuration is employed to achieve significant Kerr nonlinearity in a four-state atomic system. The probe beams can attain focusing within the medium through careful selection of input beam intensities and the spatial profile of the control field. We analytically derive the linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities for both scalar and vector probe beams. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the energy transfer from the control beam to the probe beam, the giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity facilitates the focusing of the scalar probe beam into a significantly smaller spot size. Conversely, the vector probe beams exhibit gain-induced narrowing. Furthermore, we evaluate the state of polarization for the vector beam at the minimum beam waist, observing a polarization rotation and a change in ellipticity during propagation. Through the mechanism of focusing, we achieve a reduced spot size for the probe beam, which may have substantial implications for resolution enhancement in microscopy applications.</description>

      <title>Spherical Phase Metalenses: Intrinsic Suppression of Spherical Aberration via Equiphase Surface Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale metasurfaces requires phase profiles beyond traditional hyperbolic designs. We show hyperbolic phase distributions cause spherical aberration from mismatched light propagation geometry and unrealistic phase assumptions. By analyzing metalens fundamentals via isophase surfaces, we develop a spherical phase profile based on spherical wavefront theory. This method prevents spherical aberration, essential for wide-aperture metalenses. Simulations prove superior focusing: spherical phase reduces FWHM by 7.3% and increases peak intensity by 20.4% versus hyperbolic designs at 31.46 micron radius. Spherical phase maintains consistent focusing across radii, while hyperbolic phase shows strong correlation (R squared = 0.95) with aberration. We also propose a normal vector tracing metric to measure design aberrations. This work establishes a scalable framework for diffraction-limited metalenses.</description>

      <title>Optical lever for broadband detection of fluid interface fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the optical lever principle to detect minute fluctuations of a liquid-air interface. Waves propagating on the interface deflect a specularly reflected laser beam, inducing angular deviations captured by a dual-element photodiode. We realise this principle in a compact set-up including a temperature-controlled fluid sample. Deflection angle fluctuations span five orders of magnitude in frequency, enabling detection of both low-frequency eigenmodes and high-frequency capillary waves driven by thermal effects. These results demonstrate the broad dynamical range and versatility of specular reflection spectroscopy as a minimally-invasive tool for probing interfacial dynamics in fluid and soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Om-Theory of Macroscopic Electromagnetism: Greener Vibes for Isotropy-Broken Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability ranges of macroscopic and microscopic electromagnetisms are opposite. While microscopic electromagnetism deals with point sources, singular fields, and discrete atomistic materials, macroscopic electromagnetism concerns smooth average distributions of sources, fields, and homogenized effective metamaterials. Greens function method - GFM - involves finding fields of point sources and applying superposition principle to find fields of distributed sources. When utilized to solve microscopic problems GFM is perfectly within the applicability range. Extension of GFM to simple macroscopic problems is convenient, but not fully logically sound, since point sources and singular fields are technically not a subject of macroscopic electromagnetism. This explains the difficulty of both finding the Greens functions and applying superposition principle in complex isotropy-broken media, which are very different from microscopic environments. In this manuscript, we lay out a path to solution of macroscopic Maxwells equations for distributed sources bypassing GFM, by introducing inverse approach and a method based on Om-potential which we describe here. To the researchers of electromagnetism this provides access to powerful analytical tools and a broad new space of solutions for Maxwells equations.</description>

      <title>The non-Hermitian magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a semiclassical theory for electrons in a non-Hermitian periodic system subject to perturbations varying slowly in space and time. We derive the energy of the wavepacket to first order in the gradients of the perturbations. Applying the theory to the specific case of a uniform external magnetic field, we obtain an expression for the orbital magnetization energy. Using the principles of non-Hermitian dynamics, we define a physically meaningful non-Hermitian generalization of the angular momentum operator and show that it is compatible with the real part of the orbital magnetic moment. The imaginary part of the orbital magnetic moment is also discussed and shown to originate from an imaginary counterpart to the angular momentum that gives rise to a non-Hermitian generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a platform to achieve ultra-strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here we leverage dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO2 layer. The strong out-of-plane electric fields in our tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of 0.101 and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four- to five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of our approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low-energy optical modulators.</description>

      <title>Shell-Core Structural Anisotropy in Starch Granules Revealed by Polarization-Dependent Third-Harmonic Generation Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization-dependent third-harmonic generation (P-THG) response of starch granules, revealing distinct structural organization between their inner and outer regions. By rotating the linear polarization of the excitation beam, we uncover two characteristic P-THG modulation patterns within single granules, corresponding to an outer shell and a structurally distinct inner core. These patterns are analyzed using a theoretical model based on orthorhombic symmetry, allowing us to extract key ratios of third-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor components and determine the average molecular orientation within each region. In particular, we define an anisotropy ratio, AR=\c{hi}_xxxx^((3) )/\c{hi}_yyyy^((3) ) as a quantitative descriptor of local molecular alignment. Our results show that the shell and core exhibit significantly different AR values, underscoring a transition in molecular organization across the granule. This study establishes P-THG as a powerful contrast mechanism for probing sub-micron structural heterogeneity in biological materials beyond conventional THG intensity imaging.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Lorentz local field expression with impact on the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 19th century Mossotti and Clausius developed an expression linking the electrical permittivity of a dielectric to the product of molecular polarizability and number density. Lorenz and Lorentz later extended this framework to encompass the refractive index of the dielectric. These classical expressions have proven remarkably successful in describing how permittivity and refractive index vary with number density, under the assumption that molecular polarizability remains relatively constant. While these models have stood the test of time and continue to offer valuable insights, their derivation relies on an approximation of the local electric field within a spherical cavity that represents the environment of a single molecule with its own field excluded. For regimes of higher number densities, such as those encountered in densified dielectrics, employing an exact solution for the local field becomes increasingly important. This refinement not only extends the applicability of the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz equations but also leads to more accurate estimates of molecular polarizability in general.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional reconstruction of THz near-fields from a LiNbO$_3$ optical rectification source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) generation by optical rectification in LiNbO$_3$ (LN) is a widely used technique for generating intense THz radiation. The spatiotemporal characterization of THz pulses from these sources is currently limited to far-field methods. While simulations of tilted pulse front THz generation have been published, little work has been done to measure the near-field properties of the THz source. A better understanding of the THz near-field properties will improve optimization of THz generation efficiency, transport, and coupling. We demonstrate a technique for quantitative spatiotemporal characterization of single-cycle strong-field THz pulses with 2D near-field electro-optic imaging. We have reconstructed the full temporal 3D THz near-field and shown how the phase front can be tailored by controlling the incident pump pulse.</description>

      <title>Modeling of the micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has been used for more than twenty years, it lacks a complete theoretical description. This complicates the analysis of experimental data and significantly limits the information that can be obtained. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a semi-analytical model based on the mesoscopic continuous medium approach. The model consists of the following steps: calculation of the incident electric field and the dynamic susceptibility, calculation of the induced polarisation, and calculation of the emitted electric field and its propagation towards the detector. We demonstrate the model on the examples of the measurements of thermal and coherently excited spin waves. However, the used approach is general and can describe any micro-focused Brillouin light scattering experiment. The model can also bring new analytical approaches to mechanobiology experiments or to characterization of acoustic wave based devices.</description>

      <title>Topological gap solitons in equidistant lithium niobate waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equidistant 1D arrays of thin film lithium niobate waveguides can exhibit non-trivial topology due to a specific interplay between inter- and intra-modal couplings of two families of guided modes. In this work we analyze two-colour spatial solitons, emerging due to $\chi_2$ nonlinear interactions between the modes of non-trivial topology in the fundamental harmonic field, and modes of trivial topology in the second harmonic field. We discuss solitons localized in the bulk of the array (bulk solitons), and at an edge of a finite-size array (edge solitons). The latter emerge due to the nonlinear interactions between a topological edge mode in the fundamental harmonic and bulk modes in the second harmonic. We reveal that for each type of soliton, bulk or edge, there generally exist two families of solutions with different internal structures and ranges of propagation constants. All bulk solitons can only be excited above a certain power threshold dictated by the coupling strength in the second harmonic field and the phase matching between the fundamental and second harmonics. The power threshold for edge solitons generally appears to be much lower, and, by tuning the phase matching, it can be reduced to zero.</description>
