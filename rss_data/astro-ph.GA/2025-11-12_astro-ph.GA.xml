      <description>arXiv:2511.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roman Galactic Plane Survey (RGPS) is a 700-hour program approved for early definition as a community-designed General Astrophysics Survey. It was selected following a proposal call for science programs that would benefit from an early community-based definition (Sanderson et al 2024). The community was invited to submit white papers and science pitches with a deadline of May 20, 2024; the Roman Galactic Plane Survey Definition Committee (RGPS-DC) first met on Sep 11, 2024. Based on the input provided, the RGPS-DC recommends a survey consisting of three elements: (1) a wide-field science element (691 sq deg, 541 hrs) covering the Galactic plane, Galactic latitude |b|&lt;2 deg and Galactic longitude l=+50.1 deg to -79 deg (281 deg), in four filters (F129, F159, F184, and F213) with higher latitude extensions for the bulge, the Serpens South/W40 star formation region, and Carina, (2) a time-domain science element (19 sq deg , 130 hrs) of six fields, including the full Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD) and Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), with coverage in seven filters and repeat observations in one or more filters with cadences from 11 minutes to weeks, and (3) a deep-field/spectroscopic science element (4 sq deg , 30 hrs) consisting of fifteen Roman pointings (with a wide range of extinction, diffuse emission, stellar density and population) using longer exposure times in seven filters in addition to grism and prism observations. This document summarizes the science that can be done with this survey, the process of survey definition, and details on all of the program elements.</description>

      <title>The Deepest GLIMPSE of a Dense Gas Cocoon Enshrouding a Little Red Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of strong Balmer breaks and absorption features in Little Red Dots (LRDs) suggests they host AGN embedded within dense gas envelopes, potentially powered by super-Eddington accretion. We present GLIMPSE-17775, a luminous ($L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) LRD at $z=3.501$ behind Abell S1063 ($\mu\sim2$), observed with deep JWST/NIRCam and a $\sim$20 hr (80 hr de-lensed) NIRSpec/G395M spectrum. The data reveal 40+ emission and absorption features, including a rich forest of low-ionization FeII lines and numerous broad hydrogen recombination transitions. We use this depth to test the dense-gas interpretation through five independent diagnostics. Nearly all permitted lines show exponential wings with consistent FWHM, the signature of Thomson scattering requiring $n_e\gtrsim10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Adopting this width yields $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^{6.7}M_\odot$, a factor of ten lower than Gaussian fits, and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim1.8$. Additional diagnostics support the same picture: a pronounced Balmer break ($f_{\nu,4050}/f_{\nu,3670}=2.0\pm0.1$), enhanced HeI $\lambda7065$ and $\lambda10830$ with P-Cygni absorption, Bowen-fluorescent OI $\lambda8446$-$\lambda11290$ emission requiring Ly$\beta$ pumping, and 16 FeII lines matching fluorescence models. These features indicate a dense ($n\sim10^8$ cm$^{-3}$), partially ionized cocoon where scattering and fluorescence dominate line formation, providing strong evidence that at least some LRDs are powered by super-Eddington black-hole growth in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Finding the boundary: Using galaxy membership to inform galaxy cluster extent through machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial extent of the environment's impact on galaxies marks a transitional region between cluster and field galaxies. We present a data-driven method to identify this region in galaxy clusters with masses $M_{200\rm ,mean}&gt;10^{13} M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$. Using resolved galaxy samples from the largest simulation volume of IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), we examine how galaxy properties vary as a function of distance to the closest cluster. We train neural networks to classify galaxies into cluster and field galaxies based on their intrinsic properties. Using this classifier, we present the first quantitative and probabilistic map of the transition region. It is represented as a broad and intrinsically scattered region near cluster outskirts, rather than a sharp physical boundary. This is the physical detection of a mixed population. In order to determine transition regions of different physical processes by training property-specific models, we categorise galaxy properties based on their underlying physics, i.e. gas, stellar, and dynamical. Changes to the dynamical properties dominate the innermost regions of the clusters of all masses. Stellar properties and gas properties, on the other hand, exhibit transitions at similar locations for low mass clusters, yet gas properties have transitions in the outermost regions for high mass clusters. These results have implications for cluster environmental studies in both simulations and observations, particularly in refining the definition of cluster boundaries while considering environmental preprocessing and how galaxies evolve under the effect of the cluster environment.</description>

      <title>Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei in SDSS-V: Host-Galaxy Properties and Black-Hole Scaling Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) exhibit dramatic spectral variability on unexpectedly short timescales, challenging standard accretion flow models. Despite growing samples, the physical drivers of this extreme variability, and the potential link to host-galaxy properties, remain unknown. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the transition between AGN-dominated and host-dominated spectra offers a unique opportunity to study relations between AGNs and their hosts within the same objects. We present intermediate-resolution spectroscopy of 23 CL-AGNs identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V), obtained with VLT/X-shooter and Gemini-N/GMOS. An analysis of the Mgii emission line observed in the spectra demonstrates that the majority of these sources cannot be driven by variable obscuration. Our CL-AGNs roughly follow the M_BH-sigma_* and M_BH-M_* relations of inactive galaxies, with a median black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.38%, although they show hints of a shallower slope. We find no evidence that the stellar population properties of our CL-AGNs, including stellar mass, age, young stellar fraction, and star-formation rate differ from those of Type 2 AGNs in SDSS. These results suggest that CL-AGNs reside in typical AGN host galaxies and that their extreme variability is likely unrelated to host-galaxy environment, supporting the idea that CL-AGNs are not a distinct population, but rather represent a phase of normal AGN activity. This result, in turn, implies that CL-AGNs can serve as useful probes of the AGN-host connection, providing access to both AGN-dominated and host-dominated spectra of the same systems.</description>

      <title>JWST's GLIMPSE: an overview of the deepest probe of early galaxy formation and cosmic reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the JWST GLIMPSE program, highlighting its survey design, primary science goals, gravitational lensing models, and first results. GLIMPSE provides ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam imaging across seven broadband filters (F090W, F115W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W) and two medium-band filters (F410M, F480M), with exposure times ranging from 20 to 40 hours per filter. This yields a 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of 30.9 AB (measured in a 0.2 arcsec diameter aperture). The field is supported by extensive ancillary data, including deep HST imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields program, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution multi-object spectroscopy. Exploiting the strong gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063, GLIMPSE probes intrinsic depths beyond 33 AB magnitudes and covers an effective source-plane area of approximately 4.4 arcmin$^2$ at $z \sim 6$. The program's central aim is to constrain the abundance of the faintest galaxies from $z \sim 6$ up to the highest redshifts, providing crucial benchmarks for galaxy formation models, which have so far been tested primarily on relatively bright systems. We present an initial sample of $\sim 540$ galaxy candidates identified at $6 &lt; z &lt; 16$, with intrinsic UV magnitudes spanning $M_{\mathrm UV}$ = $-$20 to $-$12. This enables unprecedented constraints on the extreme faint end of the UV luminosity function at these epochs. In addition, GLIMPSE opens new windows for spatially resolved studies of star clusters in early galaxies and the detection and characterization of faint high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. This paper accompanies the first public data release, which includes reduced JWST and HST mosaics, photometric catalogs, and gravitational lensing models.</description>

      <title>Effect of ionizing photon escape fraction in faint galaxies on modeling reionization history of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present model calculations of the reionization history of hydrogen using star formation histories, computed with a galaxy formation model which reproduces properties of local dwarf galaxies and UV luminosity functions of galaxies at $z=5-16$. We use the ionizing photon density functions predicted by the model along with different models for the escape fraction of ionizing photons, $f_{\rm esc}$, to study the effects of ionizing photons from faint galaxies and different assumptions about $f_{\rm esc}$ on the evolution of hydrogen ionized fraction with redshift, $Q_{\rm HII}(z)$. We show that accounting for the contribution of faint galaxies with UV luminosities $M_{1500}&gt;-13$, and with a constant ionizing photon escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc}=0.1$ results in the hydrogen reionization history consistent with all current observational constraints. Comparing results of the $f_{\rm esc}=0.1$ model and two alternative models shows that the model with a strong luminosity dependence of $f_{\rm esc}$, which assigns high $f_{\rm esc}$ to faint galaxies, results in early reionization inconsistent with observational constraints. However, the model in which $f_{\rm esc}$ follows a universal redshift-independent correlation with the recent maximum specific star formation rate, motivated by the results of the SPHINX galaxy formation simulation, results in the reionization history in good agreement with existing observational constraints, even though this model produces a sizeable ionized hydrogen fraction of $Q_{\rm HII}\approx 0.15-0.2$ at redshifts $z=8-12$. Our results show that the relative contribution of faint dwarf galaxies to reionization depends sensitively on assumptions about the escape fraction for galaxies of different luminosities, and that this is the main source of uncertainty in modeling hydrogen reionization.</description>

      <title>Warm and cold molecular gas in the cluster center of MACS 1931-26 with JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform one of the first spatially resolved studies of warm ($&gt;$100 K) and cold (10-100 K) molecular gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), focusing on the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of a cool-core galaxy cluster, MACS1931-26 at z=0.35. This galaxy has a massive H$_2$ reservoir and a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) and is undergoing a starburst event. We present new JWST observations of this system, revealing warm H$_2$ gas that is co-spatial with the cold molecular gas traced by CO, extending over 30 kpc around the BCG in a tail-like structure reaching into the circumgalactic medium of this galaxy. Analysis of the mid-infrared pure H$_2$ rotational lines H$_2$S(1), H$_2$S(5), and H$_2$S(9) indicate warm gas temperatures of $515.6 \pm 0.8$ K and $535.2\pm 1.9$ K in the BCG and tail regions, respectively. We compare cold gas, traced by the CO(3-2) observed with ALMA, to the warm gas traced by JWST. The warm-to-cold molecular gas fraction is comparable in the BCG ($1.4\%\pm0.2\%$) and the CGM tail ($1.9\%\pm0.3\%$). Our analysis suggests that the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the H$_2$-emitting gas is sufficient to lead to the formation of the CO gas. This observation provides new insights into the molecular gas distribution and its potential role in the interplay between the central galaxy and its circumgalactic environment.</description>

      <title>A Timescale-Resolved Analysis of the Breathing Effect in Quasar Broad Line Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-epoch virial method is a fundamental tool for estimating supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses in large samples of AGNs and has been extensively employed in studies of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time. However, since this method is calibrated using reverberation-mapped AGNs, its validity across the entire AGN population remains uncertain. We aim to examine the breathing effect-the variability of emission line widths with continuum luminosity-beyond reverberation-mapped AGNs, to assess the validity and estimate potential systematic uncertainties of single-epoch virial black hole mass estimates. We construct an unprecedentedly large multi-epoch spectroscopic dataset of quasars from SDSS DR16, focusing on four key broad emission lines (Ha, Hb, MgII, and CIV). We assess how breathing behavior evolves with the rest-frame time interval between observations. We detect no significant breathing signal in Ha, Hb, or MgII at any observed timescale. In contrast, CIV exhibits a statistically significant anti-breathing trend, most prominent at intermediate timescales. Notably, for Hb, which has shown breathing in previous reverberation-mapped samples, we recover the effect only in the small subset of quasars with clearly detected BLR lags and only during the epochs when such lags are measurable-suggesting that both the lag and breathing signals are intermittent, possibly due to a weak correlation between optical and ionizing continua. These results highlight the complex, variable, and timescale-dependent nature of line profile variability and underscore its implications for single-epoch black hole mass estimates.</description>

      <title>Chemical dissection of merger-induced $m=1$ lopsidedness in Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way harbours a prominent m=1 lopsided distortion in both stellar and neutral gas distributions. On the other hand, chemo-dynamical studies have been proven to be effective in grasping the overall evolution of galaxies. Here, we investigate systematically the excitation and evolution of a merger-driven $m=1$ lopsidedness in a Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxy, as a function of chemical distribution of stars. Using seven dissipationless, high-resolution $N$-body simulations of minor mergers (between a MW-like host and a satellite) under varying orbital configurations (prograde/retrograde and different orientation of the satellite orbital plane), we first show that a tidal interaction excites a prominent $m=1$ lopsidedness in the stellar density and velocity distribution of the MW-like host. Assigning, a posteriori, metallicities to stellar particles of the MW-like host based on the current observational constraints, we sub-divide the stars into metal-rich ([Fe/H] &gt; 0), metal-intermediate (-0.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt;0), and metal-poor (- 0.5 &lt; [Fe/H]) populations. We demonstrate that metal-rich population always show a much stronger $m=1$ lopsidedness in both density and velocity distributions when compared to other two populations. This trend holds true for all minor merger model considered here, regardless of their orbital configurations. Furthermore, minor merger also triggers a transient off-centred stellar disc-dark matter halo configuration, with metal-rich population showing the highest degree of disc-halo offset. We show that the metal-rich population which is kinematically colder (i.e. lower velocity dispersion) by construction, is more susceptible to external perturbations. Lastly, using a catalogue of photometry and metalicity for the LMC, we show that the strength of the $m=1$ distortion (predominantly in the form of an one-arm spiral) in stars increases with metallicity as well.</description>

      <title>Effect of molecular hydrogen self-shielding modeling on early Reionization Era galaxies in radiative hydrodynamic cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling molecular hydrogen ($\text{H}_{2}$) is an important task in cosmological simulations because it regulates star formation. One fundamental property of $\text{H}_{2}$ is the ability to self-shield, a phenomenon in which the $\text{H}_{2}$ in the outer layer of a molecular cloud absorbs the photodissociating Lyman-Werner UV radiation and shields the inner $\text{H}_{2}$. Historically, numerical approximations have been utilized to avoid intensive ray-tracing calculations. This paper evaluates the use of the Sobolev-like density-gradient approximation in $\text{H}_{2}$ self-shielding modeling and tests its agreement with a more rigorous adaptive ray-tracing method in cosmological simulations. We ran four high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations to investigate the models' effects in the early Reionization Era ($z \geq 12$). We find that the approximation model returns a higher $\text{H}_{2}$ photodissociation rate in low gas density environments but lower the rate when gas density is high, resulting in low-mass halos having less $\text{H}_{2}$ while high-mass halos having more $\text{H}_{2}$. The approximation also hinders star formation in small halos, but it less affects the stellar mass of larger halos. Inside a halo, the discrepancies between the two models regarding $\text{H}_{2}$ fraction, temperature, and stellar mass are radially dependent. On a large scale, the simulations using the approximation have less $\text{H}_{2}$ in the intergalactic medium and may experience a slower reionization process. These results show that the Sobolev-like approximation alters properties of galaxies and the large-scale universe when compared to the ray-tracing treatment, emphasizing a need for caution when interpreting results from these two techniques in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>From Feedback-Free Star Clusters to Little Red Dots via Compaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the origin of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) seen by JWST at cosmic morning ($z \!=\! 4 \!-\! 8$) as compact stellar systems with over-massive black holes (BHs). We propose that LRDs form naturally after feedback-free starbursts (FFB) in thousands of star clusters and following wet compaction. Analytically, we show how the clusters enable efficient dry migration of stars and BHs to the galaxy center by two-body segregation and dynamical friction against the disk. The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events. Adding to the dry growth by cluster mergers, the compactions can increase the escape velocities to retain the SMBHs. The LRDs appear at $z \!\sim\! 8$, after the formation of FFB clusters, and disappear after $z \!\sim\! 4$ when the stellar mass is above $10^9 M_\odot$ by growing post-compaction blue disks around the nuclear LRDs. The LRD abundance is expected to be $\sim\! 10^{-5} \!-\! 10^{-4}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, increasing from $z \!\sim\! 4$ to $z\!\sim\! 8$.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS Reconstructing the Milky Way Disc's star formation history with twelve-filter photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-field, multi-filter photometric surveys enable the reconstruction of the Milky Way's star formation history (SFH) on Galactic scales and offer new insights into disc assembly. The twelve-filter system of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is particularly suitable, as its colours trace stellar chemical abundances and help alleviate the age-metallicity degeneracy in colour-magnitude diagram fitting. We aim to recover the SFH of the Galactic disc and separate its chemically distinct components by combining J-PLUS DR3 photometry with Gaia astrometry. We also evaluate the potential of isochrone fitting to estimate stellar ages and metallicities as proxies for evolutionary trends. We fit magnitudes and parallaxes of $1.38\times10^{6}$ stars using a Bayesian multiple isochrone method. The bright region of the colour-absolute-magnitude diagram ($M_{r}\leq4.2$ mag) constrains ages, while the faint region provides an empirical metallicity prior mitigating the age-metallicity degeneracy. Both PARSEC and BaSTI isochrones, in solar-scaled and $\alpha$-enhanced forms, are adopted. The recovered SFH reveals two sequences: an $\alpha$-enhanced population forming rapidly between $12.5$ and $8$ Gyr ago, enriching from [M/H]$\sim-0.6$ to $0.1$ dex; and a solar-scaled sequence emerging $\sim8$ Gyr ago, dominating after $\sim7$ Gyr with slower enrichment reaching solar metallicity by $3$ Gyr. Metal-rich ([M/H]$\gtrsim0$) stars are confined to $\vert z_{GC}\vert\lesssim1$ kpc, whereas metal-poor ([M/H]$\lesssim-0.5$) stars reach $\vert z_{GC}\vert\sim2$ kpc. Simultaneous fitting of both isochrone families reveals distinct formation epochs for the thin and thick discs. J-PLUS multi-filter photometry, combined with Gaia parallaxes, mitigates age-metallicity degeneracies and enables detailed mapping of the Milky Way's temporal and chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physical Origin of the Balmer Decrement in the Broad-line Region of Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei via Spectral Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the physical origin of the Balmer decrement in the broad-line region of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we measure the temporal variability of the fluxes of the broad H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission lines using multi-epoch spectroscopic data of low-redshift AGNs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The analysis of the mean spectra reveals that the Balmer decrement shows no correlation with AGN luminosity, while it is inversely correlated with the Eddington ratio. However, the temporal variation of the Balmer decrement in individual objects exhibits an even stronger anti-correlation with AGN luminosity, suggesting that the change in AGN luminosity plays a dominant role in determining the Balmer decrement. By comparing the temporal evolution of the Balmer decrement with the continuum color, we find that reddening due to the AGN itself may not be the primary factor. Instead, radiative transfer effects and excitation mechanisms, which deviate from the Case B recombination, appear to be critical for the variation of the Balmer decrement. These results provide useful insights into the underlying physics of changing-look AGNs and high-$z$ AGNs, such as the ``little red dots'', which exhibit extreme values of the Balmer decrement that can be misinterpreted as evidence for dust.</description>

      <title>Detection of unexpected leading delays in broad H{\beta} line reverberations in the quasar PHL 1092</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delayed reverberations of broad emission lines in response to optical continuum variations have been widely observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They serve as a powerful tool for probing inner structures of AGNs and estimating the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The delays exhibit a strong correlation with approximately the square root of the optical luminosity - a relationship known as the "standard structure" of AGN broad-line regions (BLRs). Here, we report the discovery of leading delays in H{\beta} line reverberations (LDRs) in the quasar PHL 1092 preceding variations of the 5100 {\AA} continuum by 17-57 days, based on our eight-year continuous campaign of reverberation mapping of super Eddington AGNs. The LDRs suggest that the 5100 {\AA} continuum regions are so extensive that they are larger than the BLRs. This phenomenon not only fundamentally disrupts the well-established BLR size-luminosity relation but also violates the principle of causality. This unprecedented LDRs challenge the conventional methods for estimating SMBH mass as well as the standard model of AGNs. A preferred scenario to explain the LDRs is that the SMBH-disk contains a population of accreting stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) as extra heating sources of the disk. Consequently, continuum regions of the disk are efficiently stretched so that the 5100 {\AA} regions exceed the BLRs, yielding the observed LDRs. Generally, sMBH activities there could provide new physics of AGN phenomena, which can be tested by LIGO, LISA/Tianqin and ET detections of gravitational waves from sMBH mergers.</description>

      <title>A Modified 3D Biconical Outflow Model: Spatial Constraints on AGN-driven Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modified outflow model and its application to constrain ionized outflow properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By adding a rotating disk component to the biconical outflow model of Bae &amp; Woo, we find that models with a rotating disk require faster launching velocities ($\lesssim$ 1500 km s$^{-1}$) than outflow-only models to be consistent with the observed gas kinematics of local type 2 AGNs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the observed distribution of gas kinematics of a large sample ($\sim$ 39,000), constraining the launching velocity and opening angle. While the launching velocity is moderate for the majority of the local AGNs, the notable cases of 2 - 5 % show strong outflows with $V_{max} \sim 1000-1500$ km s$^{-1}$. By examining the seeing effect based on the mock integral field unit data, we find that the outflow sizes measured based on velocity widths tend to be overestimated when the angular size of the outflow is comparable to or smaller than the seeing. This result highlights the need for more careful treatments of the seeing effect in the outflow size measurement, yet it still supports the lack of global feedback by gas outflows for local AGNs.</description>

      <title>Investigating star formation scenarios in the Milky Way using YSO distributions - A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the distributions of classified young stellar object (YSO) in nine star-forming regions associated with Hii regions, namely Sh2-22, Sh2-19, Sh2-17, M16, M8, IC5070, Sh2-252, NGC2467 and M42, as a means of exploring the star formation scenarios (triggered or spontaneous) in the various regions. The YSO distributions of nine regions along the galactic longitudes and across different spiral arms were explored. It is noted that Sh2-22 and Sh2-19 may have evidence of localized triggered star formation, whereas Sh2-17 may be a spontaneous star forming region. The results showed that the location within the Milky Way may influence localized triggered star formation within individual regions. There is strong evidence that there are fewer older stars (Transition Disks) within the Outer regions of the Galaxy (2.91 +- 1.74%), accompanied by a higher number of Class I (32.49 +- 10.77%). This is different from the Inner Galactic regions where the Transition Disks are higher (32.93 +- 13.78%) as compared to low Class I sources (11.01 +- 4.81%). The number of Class II stars is relatively high and increases from the Inner regions (52.64 +- 10.07%) to Outer regions (64.54 +- 11.09%). These nine star-forming regions are not an accurate representation of locations throughout the Galaxy and the results may be biased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon a thermodynamic formalism, we show that self-gravitating systems in hydrostatic equilibrium with a uniform density are maximal entropy states when submitted to perturbations which are slow on dynamical timescale. We coin this phenomenon "thermodynamic blocking", given its similarity with the more general "kinetic blocking". This result underlines the importance of the thermodynamic formalism which proves useful when kinetic equations break down.</description>

      <title>A warm ultra-luminous infrared galaxy just 600 million years after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 9 continuum detection ($3.3 \sigma$) of MACS0416_Y1 that confirms the suspected warm dust (91$^{+62}_{-35}$ K) of this Lyman-Break Galaxy (LBG) at $z = 8.3$ with $\log_{10} M_{\ast}/$M$_{\odot} = 9.0 \pm 0.1$. A modified black-body fit to the ALMA Bands 3 through 9 data of MACS0416_Y1 finds an intrinsic infrared luminosity of 1.0$^{+1.8}_{-0.6} \times{} 10^{12}\ \mathrm{L_{\odot}}$, placing this UV-selected LBG in the regime of Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). Its luminous but modest dust reservoir (1.4$^{+1.3}_{-0.5} \times{} 10^{6}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) is co-spatial to regions with a UV-continuum slope $\beta_{\rm UV} \approx -1.5$ as seen by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging. Although this implies some dust obscuration, the JWST photometry implies less obscured star formation than seen in the complete characterization by ALMA, implying some spatial separation of dust and stars on scales below 200 pc, i.e., smaller than those probed by JWST and ALMA. This source is an extreme example of dust-obscured star formation contributing strongly to the cosmic build-up of stellar mass, which can only be revealed through direct and comprehensive observations in the (sub)mm regime.</description>

      <title>Isolated massive star candidates in NGC 4242 with GULP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textit{Context.}$ There is considerable debate on how massive stars form, including whether a high-mass star must always form with a population of low-mass stars or whether it can also form in isolation. Massive stars found in the field are often considered to be runaways from star clusters or OB associations. However, there is evidence in the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud of high-mass stars that appear isolated in the field and cannot be related to any known star cluster or OB association. Studies of more distant galaxies have been lacking so far. $\textit{Aims.}$ In this work, we identified massive star candidates that appear isolated in the field of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4242 (distance: 5.3 Mpc), to explore how many candidates for isolated star formation we find in a galaxy outside the Local Group. $\textit{Methods.}$ We identified 234 massive ($M_{ini}\geq15M_{\odot}$) and young ($\leq 10$ Myr) field stars in NGC 4242 using the Hubble Space Telescope's Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys, the UVIS channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 from the Galaxy UV Legacy Project (GULP) and optical data from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). We investigated the surroundings of our targets within the range of projected distances expected for runaway stars, $74$ pc and $204$ pc. $\textit{Results.}$ We find that between $9.8\%$ and $34.6\%$ of our targets have no young stellar groups or massive stars within the threshold radii, making them appear isolated. This fraction reduces to $3.2\%-11.5\%$ when we consider the total number of massive stars expected from the observed UV star formation rate. $\textit{Conclusions.}$ Our results show that there is a small population of young and massive, potentially isolated field stars in NGC 4242.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Dark Stars and their remnants as a possible solution to three recent cosmic dawn puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) begun to revolutionize our view of the Cosmos. The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e. ultracompact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e. very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e. Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above. Moreover, we present the best evidence so far, for the existence of SMDSs: the identification of a He~II$\lambda$2511~{\AA} absorption feature at $S/N\sim4$ in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-0.</description>

      <title>Dark Secrets of Baryons: Illuminating Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered numerous bright galaxies at high redshifts ($z\approx$ 10 -- 14). Many astrophysical models and beyond the Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these observations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark matter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the JWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress structure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on the UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model designed to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits on DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter space. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section $\propto v^{-2}$ velocity dependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of $\sim$ 1 -- 500 MeV. For other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section $\propto v^{0},\,v^{-4}$, and DM-electron scattering cross-section $\propto v^{0},\,v^{-2},\,v^{-4}$), our limits are competitive with those obtained from other cosmological observables. Our study highlights the potential of JWST observations as a novel and powerful probe of non-gravitational interactions of DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that ultralight dark photons, which couple to the Standard Model photon through kinetic mixing, can potentially source galactic scale magnetic fields. Although these magnetic fields would be too weak to detect at present in galaxies due to plasma screening effects, we show that dark photons can provide the seed magnetic field strength ($10^{-20}$ G) required for dynamo amplification in galaxies. Such dynamo-amplified magnetic fields are consistent with observations of $\mu$G strength galactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>JWST lensed quasar dark matter survey IV: Stringent warm dark matter constraints from the joint reconstruction of extended lensed arcs and quasar flux ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\tt{galacticus}} (N-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.2} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 &lt; m/M_{\odot}&lt;10^{10.7}$) of $1.6_{-1.1}^{+2.4} \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.6 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in tension with recent N-body simulations ($0.3 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are the strongest limits on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.</description>

      <title>Lost Sisters Found: TESS and Gaia Reveal a Dissolving Pleiades Complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most star clusters dissolve into the Galaxy over tens to hundreds of millions of years after they form. While recent Gaia studies have honed our view of cluster dispersal, the exact chronology of which star formation events begat which star cluster remnants remains unclear. This problem is acute after 100 Myr, when cluster remnants have spread over hundreds of parsecs and most age estimates for main sequence stars are too imprecise to link the stars to their birth events. Here we develop a Bayesian framework that combines TESS stellar rotation rates with Gaia kinematics to identify diffuse remnants of open clusters. We apply our method to the Pleiades, which previous studies have noted shows kinematic similarities to other nearby young stellar groups. We find that the Pleiades constitutes the bound core of a much larger, coeval structure that contains multiple known clusters distributed over 600 pc. We refer to this structure as the Greater Pleiades Complex. On the basis of uniform ages, coherent space velocities, detailed elemental abundances, and traceback histories, we conclude that most stars in this complex originated from the same giant molecular cloud. This work establishes a scalable approach for tracing the genealogies of nearby clusters and further cements the Pleiades as a cornerstone of stellar astrophysics. We aim to apply this methodology to other associations as part of the upcoming TESS All-Sky Rotation Survey.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger flare in the quasar PKS 0446+11</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical mechanisms driving neutrino and electromagnetic flares in blazars remain poorly understood. We investigate a prominent multi-messenger flare in the quasar PKS 0446+11 to identify the processes responsible for its high-energy emission. We analyze the IceCube-240105A high-energy neutrino event together with contemporaneous observations in the gamma-ray, X-ray, optical, and radio bands. The on- and off-flare spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are modeled within a single-zone leptohadronic framework. Multi-epoch VLBA observations from the MOJAVE program provide parsec-scale polarization data that complement the multi-wavelength light curves. No significant time delay is detected between the neutrino arrival and the flares in different energy bands. This is consistent with an extremely small jet viewing angle below 1 deg, inferred from the parsec-scale polarization structure. The flare can be reproduced by the injection of a proton population and an increase of the Doppler factor from 18 to 24. We also detect an approximately 90 deg rotation of the EVPA in the parsec-scale core during the initial phase of the flare, indicating the emergence of a shock formed by the change in the bulk plasma speed. Our comprehensive multi-messenger analysis demonstrates that the extreme beaming and sub-degree viewing angle of this distant blazar can account for the observed neutrino and electromagnetic activity. These findings strengthen the case for blazars as efficient accelerators of hadrons and as significant contributors to the observed high-energy neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>General Implicit Runge-Kutta Integrators for Multifluid Gas-Dust Aerodynamic Drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of aerodynamic drag is a fundamental step in simulating dust dynamics in hydrodynamical simulations. We propose a novel integration scheme, designed to be compatible with Strang splitting techniques, which allows for the straightforward integration of external forces and hydrodynamic fluxes in general-purpose hydrodynamic simulation codes. Moreover, this solver leverages an analytical solution to the problem of drag acceleration, ensuring linear complexity even in cases with multiple dust grain sizes, as opposed to the cubic scaling of methods that require a matrix inversion step. This new General Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator (GIRK) is evaluated using standard benchmarks for dust dynamics such as DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK. The results demonstrate not only the accuracy of the method but also the expected scalings in terms of accuracy, convergence to equilibrium, and execution time. GIRK can be easily implemented in hydrodynamical simulations alongside hydrodynamical steps and external forces, and is especially useful in simulations with a large number of dust grain sizes.</description>

      <title>Searching for Exoplanets Born Outside the Milky Way: VOYAGERS Survey Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations over the past few decades have found that planets are common around nearby stars in our Galaxy, but little is known about planets that formed outside the Milky Way. We describe the design and early implementation of a survey to test whether planets also exist orbiting the remnant stars of ancient dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way, and if so, how they differ from their Milky Way counterparts. VOYAGERS (Views Of Yore - Ancient Gaia-enceladus Exoplanet Revealing Survey) is a radial velocity (RV) search using precision spectrographs to discover exoplanets orbiting very low metallicity ($-2.8 &lt; [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \leq -0.8$) stars born in the dwarf galaxy Enceladus, which merged with the Milky Way galaxy about 10 Gyr ago. A sample of 22 candidates have been screened from a catalog of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) members using a combination of stellar properties and reconnaissance observations from the TRES spectrograph. Precision RV measurements have been initiated using the NEID, HARPS-N, and CARMENES spectrographs. We plan to focus most upcoming observations on 10 main sequence targets. Data collection is well underway, with 778 observations on 22 candidates (385 of which are 10 focus targets), but far from complete. This survey is designed to be sensitive to sub-Neptune mass planets with periods up to hundreds of days. We note that the RV analysis gives mass multiplied by $\sin (inclination)$ or the minimum mass for exoplanets. The expected survey yield is three planets, assuming that occurrence rates are similar to those in the Milky Way and taking into account the degeneracy with inclination in our yield models. Our survey is designed to detect at least one exoplanet if occurrence rates are similar to known Milky Way exoplanets or, if no exoplanets are discovered, to rule out a Milky Way-like planet population in GES with 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: Cosmological Constraints Forecast from CSST Galaxy-Scale Strong Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing by galaxies is a powerful tool for studying cosmology and galaxy structure. The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will revolutionize this field by discovering up to $\sim$100,000 galaxy-scale strong lenses, a huge increase over current samples. To harness the statistical power of this vast dataset, we forecast its cosmological constraining power using the gravitational-dynamical mass combination method. We create a realistic simulated lens sample and test how uncertainties in redshift and velocity dispersion measurements affect results under ideal, optimistic, and pessimistic scenarios. We find that increasing the sample size from 100 to 10,000 systems dramatically improves precision: in the $\Lambda$CDM model, the uncertainty on the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, drops from 0.2 to 0.01; in the $w$CDM model, the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $w$, decreases from 0.3 to 0.04. With 10,000 lenses, our constraints on dark energy are twice as tight as those from the latest DESI BAO measurements. We also compare two parameter estimation techniques -- MultiNest sampling and Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling (BHM). While both achieve similar precision, BHM provides more robust estimates of intrinsic lens parameters, whereas MultiNest is about twice as fast. This work establishes an efficient and scalable framework for cosmological analysis with next-generation strong lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Emulating Radiative Transfer in Astrophysical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer is a fundamental process in astrophysics, essential for both interpreting observations and modeling thermal and dynamical feedback in simulations via ionizing radiation and photon pressure. However, numerically solving the underlying radiative transfer equation is computationally intensive due to the complex interaction of light with matter and the disparity between the speed of light and the typical gas velocities in astrophysical environments, making it particularly expensive to include the effects of on-the-fly radiation in hydrodynamic simulations. This motivates the development of surrogate models that can significantly accelerate radiative transfer calculations while preserving high accuracy. We present a surrogate model based on a Fourier Neural Operator architecture combined with U-Nets. Our model approximates three-dimensional, monochromatic radiative transfer in time-dependent regimes, in absorption-emission approximation, achieving speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining an average relative error below 3%, demonstrating our approach's potential to be integrated into state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Constraining modified theories of gravity through the detection of one extremely large mass-ratio inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), formed by brown dwarfs inspiraling into a massive black hole, emit gravitational waves (GWs) that fall within the detection band of future space-borne detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Their detection will measure the astrophysical properties of the MBH in the center of our galaxy (SgrA$^\ast$) with unprecedented accuracy and provide a unique probe of gravity in the strong field regime. Here, we estimate the benefit of using the GWs from XMRIs to constrain the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that XMRI signals radiated from the late stages of the evolution are particularly sensitive to differences between Chern-Simons theory and general relativity. For low-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the Chern-Simons parameter $\zeta$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-3}$. For high-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the parameter $\zeta$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, using the time-frequency MCMC method, we obtain the posterior distribution of XMRIs in the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that almost all the parameters can be recovered within $1\sigma$ confidence interval. For most of the intrinsic parameters, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-3}$. For the brown dwarf mass, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-1}$, while for $\zeta$, the estimation accuracy reaches $\Delta\log_{10}\zeta=0.08$ for high eccentricity sources and 1.27 for low eccentricity sources.</description>

      <title>Growth of Metal-Enriched Supermassive Stars by Accretion and Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMSs) may explain both the early emergence of supermassive black holes and the unusual abundance patterns observed in young galaxies and globular clusters. They are traditionally associated with primordial ``direct collapse'' at very low metallicity, but recent studies indicate that SMSs can also form in metal-enriched environments alongside numerous low-mass stars. We present detailed evolutionary models of SMSs with metallicities \(Z/Z_\odot = 10^{-5}\)--\(10^{-2}\), computed using \textsc{GENEC} and consistent with protostellar growth rates derived from cluster-collapse simulations. The final masses reach \(\sim7.2\times10^{4}\,M_\odot\) at \(10^{-5}\,Z_\odot\) and \(\sim2.3\times10^{3}\,M_\odot\) at \(10^{-2}\,Z_\odot\) through gas accretion and stellar collisions. Each model is evolved through the pre-main-sequence and core-hydrogen-burning phases, terminating either at the onset of general-relativistic instability \(Z\lesssim10^{-4}\,Z\) or at core-helium exhaustion for \(Z\gtrsim10^{-3}\,Z\). The dominant growth mode transitions from collision-dominated to accretion-limited between \(Z = 10^{-4}\) and \(10^{-3}\), while stellar lifetimes remain nearly constant at \(1.8\)--\(2.0\) Myr. We find that even in extreme cases, when additional hydrogen supplied by collisions amounts to \(\sim4.7\times10^{4}\,M_\odot\), the lifetime is only extended by \(\sim0.6\) Myr. During core-hydrogen burning, the critical accretion rate required to maintain the supergiant phase along the Hayashi line (\(\dot{M}_{\mathrm{crit}}\)) decreases as nuclear fuel is consumed, reducing UV emissivity and feedback efficiency. This facilitates SMS formation in a broader range of environments than previously expected, including those with metallicities up to \(Z \simeq 0.01\,Z_\odot\), typical of globular clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bars are fundamental structures in disc galaxies, although their role in galaxy evolution is still not fully known. This study investigates the effect of the presence of bars on the environmental dependence of disc galaxies' properties using the volume-limited sample from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey. The disc galaxies with and without bars samples were obtained using the Galaxy Zoo 2 project then assigned into isolated and non-isolated sub-samples. These sub-samples were used to compare the stellar mass, star formation rate, $g-r$ colour, concentration index and gas phase metallicity, and their relationships between isolated and non-isolated environments. Then these are used to investigate if there is an existence of any difference between galaxies with and without bars. A one-to-one correspondence between isolated and non-isolated galaxy properties was observed, and a strong dependence on the environment for properties of unbarred galaxies was observed when compared to barred. The stellar mass against star formation rate, $g-r$ colour against concentration index and stellar mass against gas phase metallicity of unbarred galaxies strongly depend on environment while for barred these relations weakly depend on environment. The study concludes that bars in disc galaxies decrease the dependence of analysed properties and their relations on the environment.</description>

      <title>Backlighting extended gas halos around luminous red galaxies: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from DESI Y1 x ACT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gas density profile around galaxies, shaped by feedback and affecting the galaxy lensing signal, is imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ). We precisely measure this effect ($S/N\approx 10$) via velocity stacking with more than 800,000 spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies (LRG) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, which overlap with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 temperature maps over $\geq$ 4,000 deg$^2$. We explore the kSZ dependence with various galaxy parameters and find no significant trend with redshift, but clear trends with stellar mass and absolute magnitude in $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands. Our analysis suggests that the gas extends beyond the dark matter halo (99.5\% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). We find a tentative preference for hydrodynamical simulation models with stronger feedback that drives gas further out (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) over weaker-feedback cases (IllustrisTNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with limited statistical significance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the simulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these conclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and photometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our confidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ measurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we forecast $S/N \sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT, DESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory. These measurements will serve as an input for galaxy formation models and baryonic uncertainties in galaxy lensing.</description>

Abstract: We study the detectability of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses of $M_{\bullet}\gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ displaced by gravitational wave recoil kicks $(v_{\rm kick}=0\mathrm{-}2000\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1})$ in simulations of merging massive $(M_{\star}&gt;10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot)$ early-type galaxies. The used KETJU code combines the GADGET-4 fast multiple gravity solver with accurate regularised integration and post-Newtonian corrections (up to PN3.5) around SMBHs. The ejected SMBHs carry clusters of bound stellar material (black hole recoil clusters, BRCs) with masses in the range of $10^6 \lesssim M_{\text{BRC}} \lesssim 10^7\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and sizes of several $10\,\mathrm{pc}$. For recoil velocities up to $60\%$ of the galaxy escape velocity, the BRCs are detectable in mock photometric images at a Euclid-like resolution up to redshift $z \sim 1.0$. By Monte Carlo sampling the observability for different recoil directions and magnitudes, we predict that in $\sim20\%$ of instances the BRCs are photometrically detectable, most likely for kicks with SMBH apocentres less than the galaxy effective radius. BRCs occupy distinct regions in the stellar mass/velocity dispersion vs. size relations of known star clusters and galaxies. An enhanced velocity dispersion in excess of $\sigma \sim 600\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ coinciding with the SMBH position provides the best evidence for an SMBH-hosting stellar system, effectively distinguishing BRCs from other faint stellar systems. BRCs are promising candidates to observe the aftermath of the yet-undetected mergers of the most massive SMBHs and we estimate that up to 8000 BRCs might be observable below $z\lesssim 0.6$ with large-scale photometric surveys such as Euclid and upcoming high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy with the Extremely Large Telescope.</description>

      <title>Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) - IV: Feeding and feedback in 3C 293 observed with JWST NIRSpec</title>

Abstract: We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H$_2$2.12$\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\mu$m and Pa$\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component ($\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad outflow ($\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component ($\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$ values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 4 x 10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is lower than the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.08 $\pm$ 0.02 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (molecular) and 6.5 $\pm$ 1.7 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 5.7% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Morphology of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Optical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and wavelet scattering transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250 $\mu m$, WISE 12 $\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS HI column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.</description>

      <title>Structural evolution of quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts at UV and red rest-frame wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the wavelength dependence of structural parameters for a mass-limited sample ($M_\star&gt;10^{10}M_\odot$) of $\sim27,000$ quiescent galaxies with $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$ using $grizy$ photometry from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam and dense spectroscopy from the HectoMAP survey. Based on S\'ersic profile fits in all five bands, we estimate the circularized half-light radius $R_{e,c}$ and S\'ersic index $n$ in two rest-frames: UV (3500 \r{A}) and red (7000 \r{A}). Combined with $M_\star$, $z$, and D$_n4000$, $R_{e,c}$ and $n$ enable exploration of the evolution in the structural properties - stellar mass correlations for quiescent galaxies with different stellar population ages. At intermediate redshift, quiescent galaxies at all stellar masses show a systematic decline in $R_{e,c}$ and rise in $n$ with rest-frame wavelength. These structural variations are stronger for galaxies that recently joined the quiescent population (newcomers) than for the descendants of galaxies that are already quiescent at the survey limit, $z \sim 0.6$ (aging population). The combined evidence supports inside-out quenching as the dominant mechanism halting star formation during this epoch. The typical size of a $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ quiescent galaxy increases by $\sim30\%$ between $z \sim 0.6$ and $z \sim 0.2$ in the red and remains constant in the UV; newcomers are $\sim20\%$ larger than the aging population. In the UV, quiescent galaxies maintain a constant $n\sim4$ for the aging population and $n\sim2$ for newcomers; in the red, both subpopulations have de Vaucouleurs profiles. Our findings link newcomers to their direct progenitors in the star-forming population. For the aging population, we suggest minor mergers with progressively redder satellites at lower redshifts as the primary driver of quiescent galaxy evolution. Forthcoming sensitive large-area imaging surveys will allow testing this prediction.</description>

      <title>GravSphere2: A higher-order Jeans method for mass-modeling spherical stellar systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass-modeling methods are used to infer the gravitational field of stellar systems, from globular clusters to giant elliptical galaxies. While many methods exist, most require assumptions about the form of the underlying distribution function or data binning that leads to loss of information. With only line-of-sight (LOS) data, many methods suffer from the well-known mass-anisotropy degeneracy. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new, publicly available mass-modeling method, GravSphere2. This combines individual stellar velocities from LOS and proper motion (PM) measurements to solve the Jeans equations up to fourth order, without any data binning. Using flexible functional forms for the anisotropy profiles at second and fourth order, we show how including additional constraints from a new observable - fourth-order PMs - fully closes the system of equations, breaking the mass-anisotropy degeneracy at all orders. We test our method on mock data for dwarf galaxies, showing how GravSphere2 improves on previous methods. GravSphere2 recovers the mass density, stellar velocity anisotropy, and logarithmic slope of the mass density profile within its quoted 95% confidence intervals across almost all mocks over a wide radial range (0.1 &lt; R/Rhalf &lt; 10). We find GravSphere2 outperforms simple mass estimators, suggesting that it is worth using even when only a few LOS velocities are available. With 1,000 tracers without PMs, GravSphere2 recovers the logarithmic density slope at Rhalf with 12% (25%) statistical errors for cuspy (cored) mock data, enabling a distinction between the two. Including PMs, this improves to 8% (12%). With just 100 tracers and no PMs, we recover slopes with ~ 30% (20%) errors. GravSphere2 will be a valuable new tool to hunt for black holes and dark matter in spherical stellar systems, from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies to giant ellipticals and galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The PICS Project: II. Circumnebular extinction variations and their effect on the planetary nebula luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, the theoretical understanding of planetary nebulae (PNe) has remained in tension with the observed universal bright-end cutoff of the PN luminosity function (PNLF). The brightest younger PN populations have been observed to be fainter in their [O III] emission than expected. Recent studies have proposed that circumnebular extinction is a key ingredient in bringing their brightness down to the observed level. In this work we use the recently introduced PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations) framework to investigate the impact of different circumnebular extinction treatments on the modeled PNe and their PNLF for a large range of stellar ages and metallicities. We test how different slopes in the observed relation of extinction versus central star mass modify the bright-end cutoffs of the PNLF, finding that steeper slopes lead to large changes for young stellar populations. In contrast, the differences for older PNe are much smaller. However, for individual PNe, the extinctions observed in nearby galaxies appear to be much higher than the models predict, showing that improvements on both the modeling and observational sides are needed to gain a better understanding of the brightest and strongly extincted PNe. These findings further advance the theoretical foundation for interpreting observed extragalactic PN populations coming from more complex composite stellar populations in the future.</description>

      <title>ALMA and JWST Imaging of $z\ &gt;\ 6$ Quasars: No Spatial Position Offset Observed Between Quasars and Their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study determining the spatial offset between the position of the supermassive black hole (as traced through their broad line regions) and the host galaxy in six $z &gt; 6$ quasars. We determined the host galaxy's position from $\lesssim$$0.1^{\prime\prime}$ ($\lesssim$ 600 pc) resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) [CII] 158 $\mu m$ and corresponding dust continuum imaging. We determined the quasar's position from $\lesssim$ 400 pc resolution James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera (JWST NIRCam) imaging. We estimated the observational uncertainties on the quasar's position using astrometric data from the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) of field stars within the NIRCam images. We find that all six quasars are found within the central $\sim 400$ pc of their host galaxy dust continuum and [CII] emission. Apparent offsets seen in rest-frame optical JWST observations are not detected in our ALMA data, suggesting they likely result from dust obscuration rather than a true physical separation between the SMBH and its host galaxy. Kinematic modeling of these data further reveals that none of the galaxies show evidence for recent merger activity, and most of the galaxies can be accurately modeled using a simple disk model. The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.</description>

      <title>IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Narrowing the discovery space of the cosmological 21-cm signal using multi-wavelength constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. Here, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties using the Population II galaxy parameters derived in a previous study through multi-wavelength synergies. This includes high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), the SARAS 3 global 21-cm signal non-detection, and HERA 21-cm power spectrum upper limits. From CXB and HERA data, we infer the IGM kinetic temperature to be $T_\text{K}(z=15)\lesssim 7.7~\text{K}$, $2.5~\text{K} \lesssim T_\text{K}(z=10) \lesssim 66~\text{K}$, and $20~\text{K}\lesssim T_\text{K}(z=6) \lesssim 2078~\text{K}$ at 95% credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data limit the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving $T_\text{rad}(z=15) \lesssim 47~\text{K}$, $T_\text{rad}(z=10)\lesssim 51~\text{K}$, and $T_\text{rad}(z=6)\lesssim 101~\text{K}$. These constraints, strengthened by UVLFs from HST and JWST, enable the first $\textit{lower bound}$ on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth ${-201~\text{mK}\lesssim T_\text{21,min} \lesssim -68~\text{mK}}$ at $z_\text{min}\approx10-16$, and a power spectrum of $8.7~\text{mK}^2 &lt; \Delta_{21}^2(z=15) &lt; 197~\text{mK}^2$ at $k=0.35~h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our results highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe. While promising for upcoming 21-cm experiments, the results depend on our assumption of a redshift-independent X-ray and radio efficiency of galaxies, and the exclusion of a flexible model for Population III stars.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hierarchical Mergers: Accretion-Driven Origins of Massive, Highly Spinning Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, highlights the need to understand the origins of massive, high-spin stellar black holes (BHs). Dense star clusters provide natural environments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive star evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs through dynamical interactions (the so-called "hierarchical merger" channel), most star clusters with masses $\lesssim 10^6\,M_\odot$ have escape speeds too low to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass gap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the collision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape speed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and spin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH masses up to at least $\sim200\,M_\odot$, with spins set by the details of the growth history. BHs up to about $150\,M_\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins $\chi \gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form through multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\chi \lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters, producing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\sim10\%$ of all detectable events, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the two pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more unequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form near-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters with low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning BBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural formation pathway to GW231123-like systems.</description>

Abstract: We present calibrated ATLAS photometry of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from 28 March through 29 Aug 2025, obtained with the five-site, robotic ATLAS network in the c (420-650~nm), o (560-820~nm), and Teide w (420-720~nm) bands. Stacked difference images yield reliable light curves measured in four fixed apertures that capture the evolving coma. We observe 3I/ATLAS transitioning in color from red (c-o)~0.7 before MJD 60860 to near-solar (c-o)~0.3 after MJD 60870, coincident with the appearance of a prominent anti-solar tail. The absolute magnitude curve H(t) shows a slope break near MJD 60890 at r~3.3 au from -0.035 to -0.012 mag/day, or in terms of coma cross section as a function of heliocentric distance, r^{-3.9} to r^{-1.1}.</description>

Abstract: Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs) have been detected through direct imaging in several young, nearby star-forming regions. The properties of circumstellar disks around these objects may provide a valuable probe into their origin but are currently limited by the small sample sizes explored. We aim to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of circumstellar disks down to the planetary-mass regime. We performed a systematic survey of disks among the population identified in the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Scorpius association (USC), restricted to members outside the younger, embedded Ophiuchus region and with estimated masses below 105 M_Jup. We took advantage of unWISE photometry to search for mid-infrared excesses in the WISE (W1-W2) color. We implemented a Bayesian outlier detection method, which models the photospheric sequence and computes excess probabilities for each object, enabling a statistically sound estimation of disk fractions. We explored disk fractions across an unprecedentedly fine mass grid, reaching down to objects as low as ~6 M_Jup assuming 5 Myr or ~8 M_Jup assuming 10 Myr, thus extending the previous lower boundary of disk fraction studies. Depending on the age, our sample includes between 17 and 40 FFPs. We confirm that the disk fraction steadily rises with decreasing mass and exceeds 30% near the substellar-to-planetary mass boundary at ~13 M_Jup. We find hints of a possible flattening in this trend around 25-45 M_Jup, potentially signaling a transition in the dominant formation processes. This shift in trend should be considered with caution and needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations. Our results are consistent with the gradual dispersal of disks over time, as disk fractions in Upper Scorpius appear systematically lower than those in younger regions.</description>

Abstract: A head-tail galaxy is thought to be a radio galaxy with bent active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega" structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.</description>
