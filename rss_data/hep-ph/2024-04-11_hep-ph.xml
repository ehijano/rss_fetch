      <title>Light-by-light scattering in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions with future FoCal and ALICE 3 detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present possible future studies of light-by-light scattering using FoCal@ALICE and ALICE 3 detectors. Different mechanisms are discussed. The PbPb$\to$PbPb$\gamma \gamma$ cross section is calculated within equivalent photon approximation in the impact parameter space. Several differential distributions are presented and discussed.
  We predict cross section in the (mb-b) range for typical ALICE 3 cuts, a few orders of magnitude larger than for the current ATLAS or CMS experiments. We also consider the two-$\pi^0$ background which can, in principle, be eliminated at the new kinematical range for the ALICE 3 measurements by imposing dedicated cuts on diphoton transverse momentum and$\slash$or so-called vector asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Pati-Salam models with $A_4$ modular symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flavor structure of quarks and leptons and quark-lepton unification are studied in the framework of Pati-Salam models with $A_4$ modular symmetry. The three generations of the left-handed and right-handed fermions are assigned to be triplet or singlets of $A_4$. The light neutrino masses are generated through the type-I seesaw mechanism. We perform a systematic classification of Pati-Salam models according to the transformations of matter fields under the $A_4$ modular symmetry, and the general form of the fermion mass matrix is given. We present four phenomenologically viable benchmark models which provide excellent descriptions of masses and flavor mixing of quarks and leptons, including neutrinos. In such models we find that the normal ordered neutrino mass spectrum is preferred over the inverted case, with neutrinoless double beta decay predicted to be too small to be observed by the next generation of experiments.</description>

      <title>A Novel Model-Independent Approach to Explore New Physics in Five-body Semileptonic Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive three parameters associated with the angular distribution of semileptonic five-body decays $D_{(s)}/B_{(s)}\to V\ell^+\nu_{\ell}\,(\ell=e,\mu,\tau)$ with $V\to PPP$, where $V$ and $P$ denote vector and pseudo-scalar particles. These parameters, expected to be unity in the Standard Model, may deviate if new physics is involved. Our model-independent approach involves deriving the specific form of the angular distribution under the most general form of the decay matrix element $D_{(s)}/B_{(s)}\to V$. The outcomes have potential applications in precisely testing the Standard Model and exploring new physics. Relevant measurements can be carried out using data obtained from BESIII, Belle~II, and LHCb.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Cosmological Gravitational Particle Production in Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry within the framework of cosmological gra\-vi\-ta\-tional particle production, employing the Bogoliubov approach. We examine two well-known baryogenesis scenarios, namely baryogenesis in Grand Unified Theories (GUT) and leptogenesis, while considering reheating temperatures sufficiently low for thermal processes to be negligible. Considering $\alpha-$attractor T-models for the inflaton potential, we demonstrate that GUT baryogenesis from scalar decays can be successful across a large range of conformal couplings with gravity, without necessitating substantial levels of CP violation. In the case of leptogenesis, we find that the reheating temperature should be $T_{\rm RH}\lesssim 10^{6}~{\rm GeV}$ for right-handed neutrino masses $M_1 \lesssim 6 \times 10^{12}~{\rm GeV}$ to generate the observed asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Implications of $B \to K \nu \bar{\nu}$ under Rank-One Flavor Violation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications of the observed excess in $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ under the assumption of Rank-One Flavour Violation, i.e. that New Physics couples to a single specific direction in flavour space. By varying this direction we perform analyses at the level of the low-energy EFT, the SMEFT, and with explicit mediators such as leptoquarks and colorless vectors ($Z^\prime$ and $V^\prime$). We study correlations with other flavour, electroweak and collider observables, finding that the most interesting ones are with $K \to \pi \nu \bar{\nu}$, $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, meson mixing and the LHC searches in $\tau^+ \tau^-$ high-energy tails. Among the various mediators, the scalar leptoquarks $\tilde{R}_2$ and $S_1$ offer the best fits of the Belle-II excess, while being consistent with the other bounds. On the other hand, colorless vectors are strongly constrained by meson mixing and resonance searches in $p p \to \tau^+ \tau^-$. In all cases we find that a flavour alignment close to the third generation is generically preferred.</description>

      <title>A common framework for fermion mass hierarchy, leptogenesis and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an extension of the Standard Model designed to elucidate the fermion mass hierarchy, account for the dark matter relic abundance, and explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Beyond the Standard Model particle content, our model introduces additional scalars and fermions. Notably, the light active neutrinos and the first two generations of charged fermions acquire masses at the one-loop level. The model accommodates successful low-scale leptogenesis, permitting the mass of the decaying heavy right-handed neutrino to be as low as 10 TeV. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dark matter phenomenology and explore various interesting phenomenological implications. These include charged lepton flavor violation, muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, constraints arising from electroweak precision observables, and implications for collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-extensive Effects on the QCD Equation of State and Fluctuations of Conserved Charges within Polyakov Quark Meson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of non-extensive Tsallis statistics on the hadron phase structure has been investigated using the Polyakov-quark-meson (PQM) model. The analysis examines the non-extensive effects on the temperature dependence of PQM order parameters, thermodynamic quantities related to the QCD equation of state, and fluctuations of conserved charges at varying chemical potentials. The results show that non-extensive effects have the most significant deviations near the crossover region. The pseudo-critical temperature $T_{\chi}(\mu_B)$ is not a universal constant and decreases with increasing non-extensive $q$ parameter. The chiral phase diagram of the PQM model indicates a decrease in the behavior of the ($T_{\chi}-\mu_B$) plane with increasing non-extensive $q$ parameter. The PQM model exhibits good qualitative agreement with lattice QCD calculations. Moreover, these findings suggest the existence of a Tsallis limit, which serves as an alternative to the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) limit for the massless ideal gas. The critical endpoint (CEP) exhibits lower temperature but higher chemical potential with increasing non-extensive $q$ parameter. Overall, this study highlights the importance of non-extensive Tsallis statistics in characterizing the quark-hadron phase structure of the PQM model and contributes to a deeper understanding of non-extensive effects in the quark-hadron phase transition.</description>

      <title>Mediator Decay through mixing with Degenerate Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of the mediator particle into standard model (SM) particles plays a significant role in exploring the dark sector scenario.
  We consider such a decay, taking the dark photon mediator as an example that mixes with the SM photon.
  We find that it requires a careful analysis of the decay rate in the presence of an SM vector boson (e.g., $Z$ boson, $\rho$ meson, and true muonium, etc.) nearly degenerate with the mediator particle in mass.
  The decay rate of the mediator particle calculated in the mass eigenstate basis {\bf does not} agree with the correct result, given by the imaginary parts of the poles for the vector boson propagators, when the mixing parameter is smaller than a specific value.
  In such a case, the decay rate calculated by treating the mixing as a perturbative parameter is in agreement with the correct result.
  We clarify specific values for the mixing parameter quantitatively using several concrete examples of the SM vector bosons degenerate with the dark photon.
  When the mass mixing between the vector boson and dark photon is smaller (larger) than the decay width of the vector boson, the latter (former) method to calculate the decay rate of the mediator particle gives the correct result.</description>

      <title>The non-perturbative Sudakov Form Factor and the role of soft gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of soft gluons in inclusive collinear parton densities as well as in Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) parton densities is discussed. Applying the Parton-Branching (PBM) method, the so-called non-perturbative Sudakov form factor could be identified with the integration range $z \to 1$, which is neglected in collinear parton shower approaches.
  The importance of soft gluons could be shown by investigating the transverse momentum spectrum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs, leading to a width of the intrinsic-$k_T$ distribution which is independent on $\sqrt{s}$ , in contrast to what is observed in parton shower approaches. The reason for this behavior is traced back to the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor. The role of soft gluons for observable hadron spectra is discussed and shown to be negligible.

      <description>arXiv:2404.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear deep inelastic structure functions F_2^A(x,Q^2) as well as parton distribution functions in a nuclei are investigated in the framework of rescaling model. Our analysis is based on analytical expressions for quark and gluon densities in a proton derived at the leading order of QCD coupling. By fitting the rescaling parameters from the experimental data on F_2^A(x,Q^2)/F_2^D(x,Q^2) ratio for several nuclear targets, we derive predictions for corresponding nuclear parton distributions and, thus, for shadowing and antishadowing effects.</description>

      <title>Constraining Bosonic Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions from Neutron Star Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) may be captured around a neutron star (NS) through DM-nucleon interactions. We observe that the enhancement of such capturing is particularly significant when the DM velocity and/or momentum transfer depend on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section. This could potentially lead to the formation of a black hole within the typical lifetime of the NS. As the black hole expands through the accretion of matter from the NS, it ultimately results in the collapse of the host. Utilizing the existing pulsar data J0437-4715 and J2124-3858, we derive the stringent constraints on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section across a broad range of DM masses.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Black Hole Power Spectra from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology for analysing the relation between the energy density in gravitational waves and primordial power spectra is developed. Focusing on scalar-induced gravitational radiation, this methodology is applied to a number of scenarios for the primordial black hole formation. Being differed from conventional Bayesian approaches, its advantages include directness and computational efficiency, which are crucial for handling the complex data characteristic of gravitational wave research. As an important application, it is demonstrated that it allows to systematically identify all scenarios consistent with current and future pulsar-timing-array data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational production of massive scalars in the context of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up a formalism for calculating the energy density generated in a quantized massive scalar field in the course of the drastic change in spacetime geometry at the end of the inflationary era. The calculation relies on the notion of adiabatic vacuum. The Bogolubov coefficients are computed by employing the sudden approximation. After obtaining a general formula, we calculate explicitly the energy density generated in a particle species with $m/H \ll1$, where $m$ is the particle mass and $H$ is the Hubble constant during the inflationary epoch. We find the contribution of the long-wavelength modes to be $\propto H^5/m$. If such particles are very weakly interacting, they can come to dominate the total energy density in the Universe. Other cosmological implications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain four popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrinks the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, and obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy indicating that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter and dark energy, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and approximate universal relations for fermion soliton stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermion soliton stars are a consistent model of exotic compact objects which involve a nonlinear interaction between a real scalar field and fermions through a Yukawa term. This interaction results in an effective fermion mass that depends upon the vacuum structure in the scalar potential. In this work we investigate the tidal deformations of fermion soliton stars and compute the corresponding tidal Love numbers for different model parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of approximate universal relations for the electric and magnetic tidal deformabilities of these stars, and compare them with other solutions of general relativity, such as neutron stars or boson stars. These relations for fermion soliton stars are less universal than for neutron stars, but they are sufficiently different from the ordinary neutron star case that a measurement of the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers (as potentially achievable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors) can be used to disentangle these families of compact objects. Finally, we discuss the conditions for tidal disruption of fermion soliton stars in a binary system and estimate the detectability of the electromagnetic signal associated with such tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Search for a light muon-philic $Z'$ with the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of an additional U(1) gauge $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ symmetry would release the tension between the measured and the predicted value of the anomalous muon magnetic moment: this paradigm assumes the existence of a new, light $Z'$ vector boson, with dominant coupling to ${\mu}$ and ${\tau}$ and interacting with electrons via a loop mechanism. The $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ model can also explain the Dark Matter relic abundance, by assuming that the $Z'$ boson acts as a "portal" to a new Dark Sector of particles in Nature, not charged under known interactions. In this work we present the results of the $Z'$ search performed by the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN SPS, that collected $ \sim 9 \times 10^{11}$ 100-GeV electrons impinging on an active thick target. Despite the suppressed $Z'$ production yield with an electron beam, the limits sets by NA64-$e$ are competitive with other experimental searches, and partially exclude the $g-2$ preferred model parameter values for $Z'$ masses lighter than 2 MeV. This result proves the complementarity of this search with NA64-${\mu}$, the parallel effort of the NA64 collaboration with a muon beam.</description>

      <title>Constraining the UV with the electroweak effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering an arbitrary bare action describing BSM physics, we use the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky resummation to obtain the most general non-local electroweak effective action at second order in the field strength. We also include the contribution of the functional measure to the effective action, which is found to modify the Higgs potential by shifting its vacuum value. The resulting effective action provides one-loop corrections to the $W$ and $Z$ boson masses, ultimately leading to the most general expression for the $\rho$ parameter at one-loop. The functional measure plays a pivotal role as it allows the parameterization of $\rho$ in inverse powers of the scale of new physics, while containing non-local form factors. The comparison of $\rho$ with the latest data leads to several constraints on the UV particle spectra of BSM models.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space representation for quasi-Hermitian position-deformed Heisenberg algebra and Path integral formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of the electroweak vacuum imposes important constraints on new physics models. Such new physics models may introduce one or more new thermal phases with a lower free energy than that of the electroweak vacuum. In this case, the early universe may stay or have already evolved into one of these deeper vacuum states. We investigate this possibility in detail in the singlet extension of the Standard Model, and delineate the corresponding constraints in its parameter space. We also discuss the situation in supersymmetry as another example. To account for the possibility that the universe is trapped in a non-electroweak vacuum, we propose a procedure of calculating the vacuum stability limit efficiently.</description>

Abstract: The anomalous magnetic (MDM) and electric (EDM) dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton serve as crucial indicators of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Leveraging azimuthal angular asymmetry as a novel tool in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), we attain unparalleled precision in the study of these key properties. Driven by the highly linear polarization of coherent photons, this method uniquely enables both the MDM and EDM to contribute to the $\cos2\phi$ angular distribution in similar magnitudes. Importantly, our approach substantially narrows the parameter space, excluding more than half of it compared to expected UPC-based measurements reliant solely on the total cross-section. This method not only provides improved constraints but also minimizes the need for additional theoretical assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Weakly nonlocal (WNL) Quantum Field Theories (QFT's) may define a new class of UV-completions in particle physics and gravity, without introducing any new elementary particle. One problematic issue is how to realize spontaneous symmetry breaking without introducing an infinite tower of ghosts in the perturbative spectrum. In this letter, a WNL extension of the Standard Model (SM) is proposed: the Fuzzy Standard Model (FSM). It is a smooth deformation of the SM based on covariant star-products of fields. This new formalism realizes electroweak symmetry breaking without ghosts at tree-level. We suspect that the FSM might exhibit classicalization in the deep-UV, which could solve the electroweak hierarchy problem if it occurs at the TeV-scale.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $\psi(3770)$ resonance in line with unitarity and analyticity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inclusive and exclusive cross sections of $e^+e^-\to \text{hadrons}$ for center-of-mass energies between 3.70 GeV and 3.83 GeV to infer the mass, width, and couplings of the $\psi(3770)$ resonance. By using a coupled-channel K-matrix approach, we setup our analysis to respect unitarity and the analyticity properties of the underlying scattering amplitudes. We fit several models to the full dataset and identify our nominal results through a statistical model comparison. We find that, accounting for the interplay between the $\psi(2S)$ and the $\psi(3770)$, no further pole is required to describe the $\psi(3770)$ line shape. In particular we derive from the pole location $M_{\psi(3770)} = 3778.8 \pm 0.3$ MeV and $\Gamma_{\psi(3770)} = 25.0 \pm 0.5$ MeV. Moreover, we find the decay to $D^+D^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0$ to be consistent with isospin symmetry and derive an upper bound on the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770) \to \textrm{non-}D\bar{D}) &lt; 6\%$ at $90\%$ probability.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule studies on the possible double-peak structure of the $X17$ particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $X17$ particle, discovered by Krasznahorkay et al. at ATOMKI, was recently confirmed in the $\gamma \gamma$ invariant mass spectra by Abraamyan et al. at JINR. We notice with surprise and interest that the $X17$ seems to have a double-peak structure. This is in a possible coincidence with our QCD sum rule study of [arXiv:2006.01018], where we interpreted the $X17$ as a tetraquark state composed of four bare quarks ($u \bar u d \bar d$), and claimed that ``A unique feature of this tetraquark assignment is that we predict two almost degenerate states with significantly different widths''. These two different tetraquark states are described by two different chiral tetraquark currents $\bar u_L \gamma_\mu d_L~\bar d_L \gamma^\mu u_L$ and $\bar u_L \gamma_\mu d_L~\bar d_R \gamma^\mu u_R$. To verify whether the tetraquark assignment is correct or not, we replace the up and down quarks by the strange quarks, and apply the QCD sum rule method to study the other four chiral tetraquark currents $\bar u_L \gamma_\mu s_L~\bar s_L \gamma^\mu u_L$, $\bar u_L \gamma_\mu s_L~\bar s_R \gamma^\mu u_R$, $\bar d_L \gamma_\mu s_L~\bar s_L \gamma^\mu d_L$, and $\bar d_L \gamma_\mu s_L~\bar s_R \gamma^\mu d_R$. We calculate their correlation functions, and find that non-perturbative QCD effects do not contribute much to them. Our results suggest that there may exist four almost degenerate tetraquark states with masses about $236\sim296$ MeV. Each of these states is composed of four bare quarks, either $u \bar u s \bar s$ or $d \bar d s \bar s$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the trilinear and quartic Higgs couplings from triple Higgs production at the LHC and beyond</title>

Abstract: Experimental information on the trilinear Higgs boson self-coupling $\kappa_3$ and the quartic self-coupling $\kappa_4$ will be crucial for gaining insight into the shape of the Higgs potential and the nature of the electroweak phase transition. While Higgs pair production processes provide access to $\kappa_3$, triple Higgs production processes, despite their small cross sections, will provide valuable complementary information on $\kappa_3$ and first experimental constraints on $\kappa_4$. We investigate triple Higgs boson production at the HL-LHC, employing efficient Graph Neural Network methodologies to maximise the statistical yield. We show that it will be possible to establish bounds on the variation of both couplings from the HL-LHC analyses that significantly go beyond the constraints from perturbative unitarity. We also discuss the prospects for the analysis of triple Higgs production at future high-energy lepton colliders operating at the TeV scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a class of models providing an explanation of the origin of light neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis and offering viable dark matter candidates. In these models the Majorana masses of the active neutrino are generated by the inverse seesaw mechanism with the lepton number violating right-handed Majorana neutrino masses $\mu$ arising at three loops. The latter is ensured by the preserved discrete symmetries, which also guarantee the stability of the dark matter candidate. We focus on one of these models and perform a detailed analysis of the phenomenology of its leptonic sector. The model can successfully accommodate baryogenesis through leptogenesis in both weak and strong washout regimes. The lightest heavy fermion turns out to be a viable dark matter candidate, provided that the entries of the Majorana submatrix $\mu$ are in the keV to MeV range. The solutions are consistent with the experimental constraints, accommodating both mass orderings for active neutrinos, in particular charged-lepton flavor violating decays $\mu\to e\gamma$, $\mu\to eee$, and the electron-muon conversion processes get sizable rates within future sensitivity reach.</description>

Abstract: We consider dark matter velocity distributions with an anisotropic component, and analyze how the velocity structure can be probed in a solid state ionization detector with no directional detection capability using a daily modulation effect due to the anisotropic response function of the target. We show that with an energy resolution of &lt; 10 eV it is possible to identify the presence of an anisotropic component consistent with observations for sub-GeV dark matter, and that introduction of daily modulation information substantially improves the sensitivity in a narrow mass range.</description>

      <title>QED meson description of the anomalous particles at ~17 and ~38 MeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schwinger confinement mechanism stipulates that a massless fermion and a massless antifermion are confined as a massive boson when they interact in the Abelian QED interaction in (1+1)D. If we approximate light quarks as massless and apply the Schwinger confinement mechanism to quarks, we can infer that a light quark and a light antiquark interacting in the Abelian QED interaction are confined as a QED meson in (1+1)D. Similarly, a light quark and a light antiquark interacting in the QCD interaction in the quasi-Abelian approximation will be confined as a QCD meson in (1+1)D. The QED and QCD mesons in (1+1)D can represent physical mesons in (3+1)D when the flux tube radius is properly taken into account. Such a theory leads to a reasonable description of the masses of $\pi^0, \eta$, and $ \eta'$, and its extrapolation to the unknown QED sector yields an isoscalar QED meson at about 17 MeV and an isovector QED meson at about 38 MeV. The observations of the anomalous soft photons, the hypothetical X17 particle, and the hypothetical E38 particle bear promising evidence for the possible existence of the QED mesons. Pending further confirmation, they hold important implications on the properties on the quarks and their interactions.</description>

      <title>The collisional energy loss of a heavy-quark in a semi-quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By utilizing a background field effective theory, we compute the collisional energy loss of a heavy-quark moving through a semi-quark-gluon plasma characterized by nontrivial holonomy for Polyakov loops. We consider the elastic scatterings between the incident heavy-quark and the thermal partons with both hard and soft momentum transfers. As compared to the energy loss obtained from the perturbation theory, the hard processes get modified through the thermal distribution functions that depend on the background field, while the proper treatment of the soft processes strongly relies on the use of the hard-thermal-loop resummed gluon propagator derived from the background field effective theory. Our results show that the heavy-quark energy loss is significantly suppressed in the semi-quark-gluon plasma due to a background field that is self-consistently generated in the effective theory. On the other hand, the suppression has a strong dependence on the temperature of the plasma which becomes negligible above $2\sim 3 $ times the critical temperature. For a realistic coupling constant, ignoring a relatively weak dependence on the heavy-quark velocity, the suppression on the collisional energy loss can be approximated by an overall factor determined solely by the background field. This simple conclusion is expected to be useful for phenomenological applications in the heavy flavor physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the concept of generating function has been employed in one-loop reduction. For one-loop integrals encompassing arbitrary tensor ranks and higher-pole contributions, the generating function can be decomposed into a tensor part and a higher-pole part. While the tensor component has been thoroughly addressed in recent studies, there remains a lack of satisfactory investigations regarding the higher-pole part. In this work, we completely solve the problem. We first establish the partial differential equations governing the higher-pole generating function. Based on these equations, we derive an integration recursion relation and solve it iteratively. This approach enables us to explore the analytical structure of higher-pole reduction and provides a valuable tool for generating reduction coefficients efficiently.</description>

Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons arising in scalar field theories. Solutions for rotating Q-balls (and the related boson stars) have been shown to exist when the angular momentum is equal to an integer multiple of the Q-ball charge $Q$. Here we consider the possibility of classically long-lived metastable rotating Q-balls with small angular momentum, even for large charge, for all scalar theories that support non-rotating Q-balls. This is relevant for rotating extensions of Q-balls and related solitons such as boson stars as it impacts their cosmological phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Ab initio investigation of the $^7$Li($p,e^+e^-$)$^8$Be process and the X17 boson</title>

Abstract: Observations of anomalies in the electron-positron angular correlations in high-energy decays in $^4$He, $^8$Be, and $^{12}$C have been reported recently by the ATOMKI collaboration. These could be explained by the creation and subsequent decay of a new boson with a mass of ${\sim}17$ MeV. Theoretical understanding of pair creation in the proton capture reactions used in these experiments is important for the interpretation of the anomalies. We apply the ab initio No-Core Shell Model with Continuum (NCSMC) to the proton capture on $^7$Li. The NCSMC describes both bound and unbound states in light nuclei in a unified way with chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions as the only input. We investigate the structure of $^8$Be, the $p+^7$Li elastic scattering, the $^7$Li($p,\gamma$)$^8$Be cross section and the internal pair creation $^7$Li($p,e^+ e^-$)$^8$Be. We discuss the impact of a proper treatment of the initial scattering state on the electron-positron angular correlation spectrum and compare our results to available ATOMKI data sets. Finally, we calculate $^7$Li($p,X$)$^8$Be cross sections for several proposed models of the hypothetical X17 particle.</description>

      <title>Three-body Entanglement in Particle Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement has long served as a foundational pillar in understanding quantum mechanics, with a predominant focus on two-particle systems. We extend the study of entanglement into the realm of three-body decays, offering a more intricate understanding of quantum correlations. We introduce a novel approach for three-particle systems by utilising the principles of entanglement monotone concurrence and the monogamy property. Our findings highlight the potential of studying deviations from the Standard Model and emphasise its significance in particle phenomenology. This work paves the way for new insights into particle physics through multi-particle quantum entanglement, particularly in decays of heavy fermions and hadrons.</description>

      <title>Particle content of very inclined air showers for radio signal modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of very inclined air showers is a new challenge for next-generation radio experiments such as the AugerPrime radio upgrade, BEACON, and GRAND, which focus on the detection of ultra-high-energy particles. To tackle this, we study the electromagnetic particle content of very inclined air showers, which has scarcely been studied so far. Using the simulation tools CORSIKA and CoREAS, and analytical modeling, we explore the energy range of the particles that contribute most to the radio emission, quantify their lateral extent, and estimate the atmospheric depth at which the radio emission is strongest. We find that the distribution of the electromagnetic component in very inclined air showers has characteristic features that could lead to clear signatures in the radio signal, and hence impact the reconstruction strategies of next-generation radio-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Fourier Calculus from Intersection Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on recent advances in studying the co-homological properties of Feynman integrals, we apply intersection theory to the computation of Fourier integrals. We discuss applications pertinent to gravitational bremsstrahlung and deep inelastic scattering in the saturation regime. After identifying the bases of master integrals, the latter are evaluated by means of the differential equation method. Finally, new results with exact dependence on the spacetime dimension D are presented.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Ginzburg-Landau expansions: superconductivity in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and chiral symmetry breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) expansion in the context of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory for superconductivity and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. We present derivations of the all-order formulas for the coefficients of the GL expansions in both systems under the mean-field approximation. We show that the convergence radii for the BCS gap $\Delta$ and dynamical quark mass $M$ are given by $\Delta_\text{conv} = \pi T$ and $M_\text{conv} = \sqrt{\mu^2 + (\pi T)^2}$, respectively. We also discuss the implications of these results and the quantitative reliability of the GL expansion near the first-order chiral phase transition.</description>
