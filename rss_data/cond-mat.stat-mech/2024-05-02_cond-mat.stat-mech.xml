      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated as a function of twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing an effective connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity can result in modified statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer is an increasing function of the screening length, or decreasing function the density of states at the Fermi energy in the electrode, and subsequently a non-monotonic function of twist angle. We find the twist angle alters the density of states, which tunes the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer, as well as the reorganization energy by altering the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to cast the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, in a manner consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of mesoscopic processes with hydrodynamic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic colloidal particles are often used as probes to study the non-equilibrium activity of living matter or other complex systems. In many of these contexts hydrodynamic interactions between the probe particle and the system of interest play an important role. However little is known about what effect such interactions could have on the overall non-equilibrium characteristics of the system of interest. In this paper, we study two simple models experimentally and theoretically, which demonstrate that hydrodynamic interactions could either diminish or enhance the total entropy production of the combined system. Importantly, we show that our method of calculating entropy production helps identify heat flows consistently, even in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions. The results indicate that interactions can be finely tuned to optimize not only dynamic properties but also irreversibility and energy dissipation, thereby opening new avenues for tailored control and design of driven mesoscale systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification of chaos is a challenging issue in complex dynamical systems. In this paper, we discuss the chaotic properties of generalized Lotka-Volterra and May-Leonard models of biodiversity, via the Hamming distance density. We identified chaotic behavior for different scenarios via the specific features of the Hamming distance and the method of q-exponential fitting. We also investigated the spatial autocorrelation length to find the corresponding characteristic length in terms of the number of species in each system. In particular, the results concerning the characteristic length are in good accordance with the study of the chaotic behavior implemented in this work.</description>

      <title>Information propagation in Gaussian processes on multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems with multiple processes evolving on different temporal scales are naturally described by multilayer networks, where each layer represents a different timescale. In this work, we show how the multilayer structure shapes the generation and propagation of information between layers. We derive a general decomposition of the multilayer probability for continuous stochastic processes described by Fokker-Planck operators. In particular, we focus on Gaussian processes, for which this solution can be obtained analytically. By explicitly computing the mutual information between the layers, we derive the fundamental principles that govern how information is propagated by the topology of the multilayer network. In particular, we unravel how edges between nodes in different layers affect their functional couplings. We find that interactions from fast to slow layers alone do not generate information, leaving the layers statistically independent even if they affect their dynamical evolution. On the other hand, interactions from slow to fast nodes lead to non-zero mutual information, which can then be propagated along specific paths of interactions between layers. We employ our results to study the interplay between information and instability, identifying the critical layers that drive information when pushed to the edge of stability. Our work generalizes previous results obtained in the context of discrete stochastic processes, allowing us to understand how the multilayer nature of complex systems affects their functional structure.</description>

      <title>Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time in an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability. The relative strength of the divergence of the scales depends on the particular integrable limit. This allows us to define two different universality classes of quantum thermalization: short- and long-range networks.</description>

      <title>Classifying two-body Hamiltonians for Quantum Darwinism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism is a paradigm to understand how classically objective reality emerges from within a fundamentally quantum universe. Despite the growing attention that this field of research as been enjoying, it is currently not known what specific properties a given Hamiltonian describing a generic quantum system must have to allow the emergence of classicality. Therefore, in the present work, we consider a broadly applicable generic model of an arbitrary finite-dimensional system interacting with an environment formed from an arbitrary collection of finite-dimensional degrees of freedom via an unspecified, potentially time-dependent Hamiltonian containing at most two-body interaction terms. We show that such models support quantum Darwinism if the set of operators acting on the system which enter the Hamiltonian satisfy a set of commutation relations with a pointer observable and with one other. We demonstrate our results by analyzing a wide range of example systems: a qutrit interacting with a qubit environment, a qubit-qubit model with interactions alternating in time, and a series of collision models including a minimal model of a quantum Maxwell demon.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Realism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realism about quantum theory naturally leads to realism about the quantum state of the universe. It leaves open whether it is a pure state represented by a wave function, or an impure one represented by a density matrix. I characterize and elaborate on Density Matrix Realism, the thesis that the universal quantum state is objective but can be impure. To clarify the thesis, I compare it with Wave Function Realism, explain the conditions under which they are empirically equivalent, consider two generalizations of Density Matrix Realism, and answer some frequently asked questions. I end by highlighting an implication for scientific realism.</description>

      <title>Stability of Information in the Heat Flow Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering methods must be tailored to the dataset it operates on, as there is no objective or universal definition of ``cluster,'' but nevertheless arbitrariness in the clustering method must be minimized. This paper develops a quantitative ``stability'' method of determining clusters, where stable or persistent clustering signals are used to indicate real structures have been identified in the underlying dataset. This method is based on modulating clustering methods by controlling a parameter -- through a thermodynamic analogy, the modulation parameter is considered ``time'' and the evolving clustering methodologies can be considered a ``heat flow.'' When the information entropy of the heat flow is stable over a wide range of times -- either globally or in the local sense which we define -- we interpret this stability as an indication that essential features of the data have been found, and create clusters on this basis.</description>

      <title>2d Ising Critical Couplings from Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an exact holographic duality formula between the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model and 3d quantum gravity, we provide a formula for "real" zeroes of the 2d Ising partition function on finite graphs in terms of the geometry of a 2d triangulation embedded in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex phase of those zeroes is given by the dihedral angles of the triangulation, which reflect its extrinsic curvature within the ambient 3d space, while the modulus is given by the angles within the 2d triangles, thus encoding the intrinsic geometry of the triangulation. Our formula can not cover the whole set of Ising zeroes, but we conjecture that a suitable complexification of these "real" zeroes would provide a more thorough formula. Nevertheless, in the thermodynamic limit, in the case of flat planar 2d triangulations, our Ising zeroes formula gives the critical couplings for isoradial graphs, confirming its generality. This approach shows an intricate, but precise, new relation between statistical mechanics and quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Observation of an inverse turbulent-wave cascade in a driven quantum gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a homogeneous 2D Bose gas driven isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size. Starting with an equilibrium condensed gas, at long drive times we observe a nonthermal steady state. At increasing lengthscales, starting from the forcing one, the steady-state momentum distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum, with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum intriguingly reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we also reveal the qualitative picture of the cascade-formation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviours of anisotropic XY ferromagnet in the presence of random field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anisotropic XY ferromagnet has been studied by Monte Carlo simulation in a three dimensional simple cubic lattice. The increase in critical temperature (ferro-para transition) has been noticed with increasing the strength of anisotropy. The effects of random fields (both with full circular symmetry and in angular window) on the critical temperature are investigated systematically in the anisotropic XY ferromagnet in three dimensions. Reduction in the critical temperature of anisotropic XY ferromagnet has been observed in the presence of random field. The compensating field (the required amount of field which preserves the critical temperature for isotropic XY ferromagnet) has been studied as a function of the strength of anisotropy. The compensating field was found to depend linearly on the strength of anisotropy. We have also studied the effects of random field confined in the angular window and observed the reduction of the critical temperature with increase of the angular extension. The critical behaviours are formalized by the usual finite size analysis and the estimation of critical exponents for the susceptibility and the specific heat. .</description>

      <title>Density and current statistics in boundary-driven monitored fermionic chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system of non-interacting fermions featuring both boundary driving and continuous monitoring of the bulk particle density. Due to the measurements, the expectation values of the local density and current operators are random variables whose average behavior is described by a well studied Lindblad master equation. By means of exact numerical computations, we go beyond the averaged dynamics and study their full probability distribution functions, focusing on the late-time stationary regime. We find that, contrary to the averaged values, the spatial profiles of the median density and current are non-trivial, exhibiting qualitative differences as a function of the monitoring strength. At weak monitoring, the medians are close to the means, displaying diffusive spatial profiles. At strong monitoring, we find that the median density and current develop a domain-wall and single-peak profile, respectively, which are suggestive of a Zeno-like localization in typical quantum trajectories. While we are not able to identify a sharp phase transition as a function of the monitoring rate, our work highlights the usefulness of characterizing typical behavior beyond the averaged values in the context of monitored many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We show that, simultaneous local scaling of coordinate and time keeping the velocity unaltered is a symmetry of an It\^o-process. Using this symmetry, any It\^o-process can be mapped to a universal additive Gaussian-noise form. We use this mapping to separate the canonical and micro-canonical part of stochastic dynamics of a Brownian particle undergoing coordinate dependent diffusion. We identify the equilibrium distribution of the system and associated entropy induced by coordinate dependence of diffusion. Equilibrium physics of such a Brownian particle in a heat-bath of constant temperature is that of an It\^o-process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a circuit made of thermodynamic devices in stationary nonequilibrium, we determine the mean currents (of energy, matter, charge, etc) exchanged with external reservoirs driving the circuit out of equilibrium. Starting from the conductance matrix describing the nonlinear current--force characteristics of each device, we obtain the conductance matrix of the composite device. This generalizes the rule of resistance addition (serial association) or conductance addition (parallel association) in stationary out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics and for multiple coupled potentials and currents of different natures. Our work emphasizes the pivotal role of conservation laws when creating circuits of complex devices. Finally, two examples illustrate the determination of the conservation laws for the serial and parallel associations of thermodynamic devices.</description>

Abstract: We point out that Percus's collision integral for one-dimensional hard rods [J. K. Percus, Physics of Fluids 12, 1560-1563 (1969)] does not preserve the thermal equilibrium state in an external trapping potential. We derive a revised Enskog equation for hard rods and show that it preserves this thermal state exactly. In contrast to recent proposed kinetic equations for dynamics in integrability-breaking traps, both our kinetic equation and its thermal states are explicitly nonlocal in space. Our equation differs from earlier proposals at third order in spatial derivatives and we attribute this discrepancy to the choice of collision integral underlying our approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement In Mixed-Spin Trimmer: Effects of A Magnetic Field And Heterogeneous g-Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) trimmer with two different Land\'{e} g-factors and two different exchange couplings is considered. The main feature of the model is non-conserving magnetization. The Hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized analytically. We presented a detailed analysis of the ground state properties, revealing several possible ground state phase diagrams and magnetization profiles. The main focus is on how non-conserving magnetization affects quantum entanglement. We have found that non-conserving magnetization can bring to the continuous dependence of the entanglement quantifying parameter (negativity) on magnetic field within the same eigenstate, while for the case of uniform $g$-factors it is a constant. The main result is an essential enhancement of the entanglement in case of uniform couplings for one pair of spins caused by an arbitrary small difference in the values of $g$-factors. This enhancement is robust and brings to almost 7-fold increasing of the negativity. We have also found weakening of entanglement for other cases. Thus, non-conserving magnetization offers a broad opportunity to manipulate the entanglement by means of magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We study Anderson localization in disordered tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices. Such lattices are geometries intermediate between ordinary two-dimensional crystalline lattices, which localize at infinitesimal disorder, and Bethe lattices, which localize at strong disorder. Using state-of-the-art computational group theory methods to create large systems, we approximate the thermodynamic limit through appropriate periodic boundary conditions and numerically demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization transition on the $\{8,3\}$ and $\{8,8\}$ lattices. We find unusually large critical disorder strengths, determine critical exponents, and observe a strong finite-size effect in the level statistics.</description>

      <title>Mass-based separation of active Brownian particles in an asymmetric channel</title>

Abstract: Inertial effects should be considered for micro- and nano-swimmers moving in a low-density medium confined by irregular structures that create entropic barriers, where viscous effects are no longer paramount. Here, we present a separation mechanism of self-propelled particles in a two-dimensional asymmetric channel, which leads to the drift of particles of different masses in opposite directions. In particular, this mechanism is based on the combined action of the spatial asymmetry of the channel structure, the temporal asymmetry inherent in particles dynamics, and an external static force. This work is relevant for potential applications that can be found in the development of lab-on-a-chip devices and artificial channels for separating particles of different masses.</description>

      <title>KPZ fluctuations in finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes, adapted from the habilitation thesis of the author, survey in a first part various exact results obtained in the past few decades about KPZ fluctuations in one dimension, with a special focus on finite volume effects describing the relaxation to its stationary state of a finite system starting from a given initial condition. The second part is more specifically devoted to an approach allowing to express in a simple way the statistics of the current in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process in terms of a contour integral on a compact Riemann surface, whose infinite genus limit leads to KPZ fluctuations in finite volume.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>
