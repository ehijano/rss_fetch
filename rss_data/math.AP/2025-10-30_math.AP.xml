      <title>Large-Time Analysis of the Langevin Dynamics for Energies Fulfilling Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we take a step towards understanding overdamped Langevin dynamics for the minimization of a general class of objective functions $\mathcal{L}$. We establish well-posedness and regularity of the law $\rho_t$ of the process through novel a priori estimates, and, very importantly, we characterize the large-time behavior of $\rho_t$ under truly minimal assumptions on $\mathcal{L}$. In the case of integrable Gibbs density, the law converges to the normalized Gibbs measure. In the non-integrable case, we prove that the law diffuses. The rate of convergence is $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$. Under a Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on $\mathcal{L}$, we also derive sharp exponential contractivity results toward the set of global minimizers. Combining these results we provide the first systematic convergence analysis of Langevin dynamics under PL conditions in non-integrable Gibbs settings: a first phase of exponential in time contraction toward the set of minimizers and then a large-time exploration over it with rate $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of solutions in the 1d bi-harmonic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one dimensional 4th order, or bi-harmonic, nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, namely, $i u_t - \Delta^2 u - 2a \Delta u + |u|^{\alpha} u = 0, ~ x,a \in \R$, $\alpha&gt;0$, and investigate the dynamics of its solutions for various powers of $\alpha$, including the ground state solutions and their perturbations, leading to scattering or blow-up dichotomy when $a \leq 0$, or to a trichotomy when $a&gt;0$. Ground state solutions are numerically constructed, and their stability is studied, finding that the ground state solutions may form two branches, stable and unstable, which dictates the long-term behavior of solutions. Perturbations of the ground states on the unstable branch either lead to dispersion or the jump to a stable ground state. In the critical and supercritical cases, blow-up in finite time is also investigated, and it is conjectured that the blow-up happens with a scale-invariant profile (when $a=0$) regardless of the value of $a$ of the lower dispersion. The blow-up rate is also explored.</description>

      <title>Boundary determination of electromagnetic parameters from local data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend and simplify the methods in [13] to improve the results on uniqueness of the boundary determination for the Maxwell equation. In particular, we show that the electromagnetic parameters are uniquely determined to infinite order at the boundary from the local admittance map, disregarding the presence of an unknown obstacle, where actually only the local Cauchy data of the fundamental solution are used. The proof mainly relies on an elaborate singularity analysis on certain singular solutions to the Maxwell equation.</description>

      <title>Self-similar blowup from arbitrary data for supercritical wave maps with additive noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastically perturbed wave maps from $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ into $\mathbb{S}^d$, in all energy-supercritical dimensions $d \geq 3$. We show that corotational non-degenerate Gaussian additive noise leads to self-similar blowup with positive probability for any corotational initial data. The same result without noise is conjectured, but unknown, for large data.</description>

      <title>Steady super-Alfv\'enic MHD shocks with aligned fields in two-dimensional almost flat nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentz force induced by the magnetic field in MHD flow introduces a fundamental difference from pure gas dynamics by facilitating the anisotropic propagation of small disturbances, thus the type of steady MHD equations depends on not only the Mach number but also the Alfv\'en number. In the super-Alfv\'enic case, we derive an admissible condition for the locations of transonic shock fronts in terms of the nozzle wall profile and the exit total pressure (the kinetic plus magnetic pressure). Starting from this initial approximation, a nonlinear existence of super-Alfv\'enic transonic shock solution to steady MHD equations is established. Our admissible condition is slightly different from that first introduced by Fang-Xin in [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 74 (2021), pp. 1493-1544], and because our formulation is based on the deformation-curl decomposition of the steady MHD equations, our admissible condition has the advantage that a direct generalization to three dimensional case is available at least at the level of the initial approximation of the shock position.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the two-dimensional steady incompressible Euler equations in an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of five classes of boundary value problems for the two-dimensional steady incompressible Euler equations in an annular domain. Three of these boundary conditions can be effectively addressed using the Grad-Shafranov method, and the well-posedness of solutions in the $C^{1,\al}$ space is established via variational techniques. We demonstrate that all five classes of boundary value problems are solvable through the vorticity transport method. Based on this approach, we further prove the well-posedness of $C^{2,\al}$ solutions under a perturbation framework.</description>

      <title>On Type I blowup and $\varepsilon$-regularity criteria of suitable weak solutions to the 3D incompressible MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some new $\varepsilon$-regularity criteria related to the suitable weak solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible MHD equations. Our criteria allow great flexibility: The smallness and boundedness assumptions can be imposed on any scaling-invariant quantities of $u$ and $b$, respectively, which may be chosen independently. As an intermediate step, we also show that the boundedness of any scaling-invariant quantity of $u$ and $b$, chosen independently, ensures that $(0,0)$ is at most a Type I singular point, i.e. $A(u,b;r)+E(u,b;r)+C(u,b;r)+D(p;r)&lt;\infty$. This extends Seregin's Type I criteria for the Navier--Stokes equations (2006, Zap. Nauchn. Sem. POMI) \cite{seregin2006Estimates} to the MHD system and provides a natural starting point for analysing Type II blowup, as in Seregin (2024, Comm. Pure Appl. Anal.) \cite{seregin2024Remarks}.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stability of a Degenerate Euler-Bernoulli Beam with Axial Force and Delayed Boundary Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global exponential stabilization of a degenerate Euler-Bernoulli beam system subject to axial loading and time-delay boundary input. The core challenge lies in the simultaneous presence of degeneracy of flexural rigidity and input delay. We address the well-posedness of the problem by constructing a non-standard energy space and proving the existence of a $C_0$-semigroup of contractions using L\"umer-Phillips theorem. For stabilization, we construct a novel Lyapunov functional incorporating integral terms specially designed for the delay and weighting functions adapted to the degenerate dynamics, with which we demonstrate the uniform exponential decay for the closed-loop system and derive a precise decay rate estimate independent of the time delay. This work provides a significant extension to the stability theory for complex distributed parameter systems.</description>

      <title>Regularization for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with rough potential: one-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the following Schr\"odinger equation with a spatial potential
  \begin{align*}
  i\partial_t u+\partial_x^2 u+\eta u=0,
  \end{align*}
  where $\eta$ is a given spatial potential (including the delta potential and $|x|^{-\gamma}$-potential). Our goal is to provide the regularization mechanism of this model when the potential $\eta\in L_x^r+L_x^\infty$ is rough. In this paper, we mainly focus on one-dimensional case and establish the following results:
  1) When the potential $\eta \in L_x^1+L_x^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, then the solution is in $H_x^{\frac 32-}(\mathbb{R})$; however, there exists some $\eta \in L_x^1+L_x^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ such that the solution is not in $H_x^{\frac 32}(\mathbb{R})$;
  2) When the potential $\eta \in L_x^r+L_x^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ for $1&lt;r\leq 2$, then the solution is in $H_x^{\frac 52-\frac 1r}(\mathbb{R})$; however, there exists some $\eta \in L_x^r+L_x^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ such that the solution is not in $H_x^{\frac 52-\frac 1r+}(\mathbb{R})$;
  3) When the potential $\eta \in L_x^r+L_x^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ for $r&gt;2$, then the solution is in $H_x^{2}(\mathbb{R})$; however, there exists some $\eta \in L_x^r+L_x^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ such that the solution is not in $H_x^{2+}(\mathbb{R})$.
  Hence, we provide a complete classification of the regularity mechanism. Our proof is mainly based on the application of the commutator, local smoothing effect and normal form method. Additionally, we also discuss, without proof, the influence of the existence of nonlinearity on the regularity of solution.</description>

      <title>Regularization for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with rough potential: high-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the regularization mechanisms of the Schr\"odinger equation with a spatial potential
  $$
  i\partial_t u+\Delta u+\eta u =0,
  $$
  where $\eta$ denotes a given spatial potential. The regularity of solutions constitutes one of the central problems in the theory of dispersive equations. Recent works \cite{Bai-Lian-Wu-2024, M-Wu-Z24} have established the sharp regularization mechanisms for this model in the whole space $\mathbb{R}$ and on the torus $\mathbb{T}$, with $\eta$ being a rough potential.
  The present paper extends the line of research to the high-dimensional setting with rough potentials $\eta \in L_x^r+L_x^{\infty}$. More precisely, we first show that when $1\leq r &lt;\frac d2$, there exists some $\eta \in L_x^r+L_x^{\infty}$ such that the equation is ill-posed in $H_x^{\gamma}$ for any $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$. Conversely, when $\frac d2 \leq r \leq \infty$, the expected optimal regularity is given by $$H_x^{\gamma_*}, \quad \gamma_*=\mbox{min}\{2+\frac d2-\frac dr, 2\}.$$
  We establish a comprehensive characterization of the regularity, with the exception of two dimensional endpoint case $d=2, r=1$. Our novel theoretical framework combines several fundamental ingredients: the construction of counterexamples, the proposal of splitting normal form method, and the iterative Duhamel construction. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the effect of the interaction between rough potentials and nonlinear terms on the regularity of solutions.</description>

      <title>Dissipative structure and decay rate for an inviscid non-equilibrium radiation hydrodynamics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the diffusion approximation, non-equilibrium model of radiation hydrodynamics derived by Buet and Despr\'es (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transf. 85 (2004), no. 3-4, 385-418). The latter describes a non-relativistic inviscid fluid subject to a radiative field under the non-equilibrium hypothesis, that is, when the temperature of the fluid is different from the radiation temperature. It is shown that local solutions exist for the general system in several space dimensions. It is also proved that only the one-dimensional model is genuinely coupled in the sense of Kawashima and Shizuta (Hokkaido Math. J. 14 (1985), no. 2, 249-275). A notion of entropy function for non-conservative parabolic balance laws is also introduced. It is shown that the entropy identified by Buet and Despr\'es is an entropy function for the system in the latter sense. This entropy is used to recast the one-dimensional system in terms of a new set of perturbation variables and to symmetrize it. With the aid of genuine coupling and symmetrization, linear decay rates are obtained for the one dimensional problem. These estimates, combined with the local existence result, yield the global existence and decay in time of perturbations of constant equilibrium states in one space dimension.</description>

      <title>An almost-almost-Schur lemma on the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent preprint, Frank and the second author proved that if a metric on the sphere of dimension $d&gt;4$ almost minimizes the total $\sigma_2$-curvature in the conformal class of the standard metric, then it is almost the standard metric (up to M\"obius transformations). This is achieved quantitatively in terms of a two-term distance to the set of minimizing conformal factors. We extend this result to the case $d=3$. While the standard metric still minimizes the total scalar curvature for $d=3$, it maximizes the total $\sigma_2$-curvature, which turns the related functional inequality into a reverse Sobolev-type inequality. As a corollary of our result, we obtain quantitative versions for a family of interpolation inequalities including the Andrews--De Lellis--Topping inequality on the $3$-sphere. The latter is itself a stability result for the well-known Schur lemma and is therefore called almost-Schur lemma. This makes our stability result an almost-almost-Schur lemma.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis for an implementable scheme to solve the linear-quadratic stochastic optimal control problem with stochastic wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an optimal control problem for the stochastic wave equation driven by affine multiplicative noise, formulated as a stochastic linear-quadratic (SLQ) problem. By applying a stochastic Pontryagin's maximum principle, we characterize the optimal state-control pair via a coupled forward-backward SPDE system. We propose an implementable discretization using conforming finite elements in space and an implicit midpoint rule in time. By a new technical approach we obtain strong convergence rates for the discrete state-control pair without relying on Malliavin calculus. For the practical computation we develop a gradient-descent algorithm based on artificial iterates that employs an exact computation for the arising conditional expectations, thereby eliminating costly Monte Carlo sampling. Consequently, each iteration has a computational cost that is proportional to the number of spatial degrees of freedom, producing a scalable method that preserves the established strong convergence rates. Numerical results validate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Constructing entire minimal graphs by evolving planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an evolving-plane ansatz for the explicit construction of entire minimal graphs of dimension $n$ ($n\geq 3$) and codimension $m$ ($m\geq 2$), for any odd integer $n$. Under this ansatz, the minimal surface system reduces to the geodesic equation on the Grassmannian in affine coordinates. Geometrically, this equation dictates how the slope of an $(n-1)$ plane evolves as it sweeps out a minimal graph. This framework yields a rich family of explicit entire minimal graphs of odd dimension $n$ and arbitrary codimension $m$.</description>

      <title>On a wave kinetic equation with resonance broadening in oceanography and atmospheric sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a three-wave kinetic equation with resonance broadening arising from the theory of stratified ocean flows. Unlike Gamba-Smith-Tran(On the wave turbulence theory for stratified flows in the ocean, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 30 (2020), no.1, 105--137), we employ a different formulation of the resonance broadening, which makes the present model more suitable for ocean applications. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the new resonance broadening kinetic equation.</description>

      <title>Cluster Formation in Diffusive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the formation of clusters for stochastic interacting particle systems (SIPS) that interact through short-range attractive potentials in a periodic domain. We consider kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics and focus on the low-friction regime. Employing a linear stability analysis for the kinetic McKean-Vlasov equation, we show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, and for sufficiently short-ranged interactions, the particles form clusters that correspond to metastable states of the mean-field dynamics. We derive the friction and particle-count dependent cluster-formation time and numerically measure the friction-dependent times to reach a stationary state (given by a state in which all particles are bound in a single cluster). By providing both theory and numerical methods in the inertial stochastic setting, this work acts as a bridge between cluster formation studies in overdamped Langevin dynamics and the Hamiltonian (microcanonical) limit.</description>

      <title>Can quantum dynamics emerge from classical chaos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anosov geodesic flows are among the simplest mathematical models of deterministic chaos. In this survey we explain how, quite unexpectedly, quantum dynamics emerges from purely classical correlation functions. The underlying mechanism is the discrete Pollicott Ruelle spectrum of the geodesic flow, revealed through microlocal analysis. This spectrum naturally arranges into vertical bands; when the rightmost band is separated from the rest by a gap, it governs an effective dynamics that mirrors quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>The $p$-th dual Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity corresponding to a $k$-Hessian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the dual curvature measures [Y. Huang, E. Lutwak, D. Yang \&amp; G. Y. Zhang, Acta. Math. 216 (2016): 325-388], which connects the cone-volume measure and Aleksandrov's integral curvature, and has created a precedent for the theoretical research of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory.
  Motivated by the foregoing groundbreaking works, the present paper introduces the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional rigidity associated with a $k$-Hessian equation and establishes its Hadamard variational formula with $1\leq k\leq n-1$, which induces the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional measure. Further, based on the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional measure, this article, for the first time, proposes the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem of the $k$-torsional rigidity which can be equivalently converted to a nonlinear partial differential equation in smooth case: \begin{align}\label{eq01} f(x)=\tau(|\nabla h|^2+h^2)^{\frac{p-n}{2}}h_{\Omega}(x)|Du(\nu^{-1}_\Omega(x))|^{k+1}\sigma_{n-k}(h_{ij}(x)+h_\Omega(x)\delta_{ij}), \end{align} where $\tau&gt;0$ is a constant, $f$ is a positive smooth function defined on $S^{n-1}$ and $\sigma_{n-k}$ is the $(n-k)$-th elementary symmetric function of the principal curvature radii. We confirm the existence of smooth non-even solution to the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem of the $k$-torsional rigidity for $p&lt;n-2$ by the method of a curvature flow which converges smoothly to the solution of equation (\ref{eq01}). Specially, a novel approach for the uniform lower bound estimation in the $C^0$ estimation for the solution to the curvature flow is presented with the help of invariant functional $\Phi(\Omega_t)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of non-constant periodic solutions to the Lorentz force equation, where no scalar potential is needed to induce the electromagnetic field. Our results extend to cases where a possibly singular scalar potential is present, although the vector potential assumes a leading role. The approach is based on minimizing the action functional associated with the relativistic Lagrangian. The compactness of the minimizing sequences requires the existence of negative values for the functional, which is proven using novel ideas that exploit the sign-indefinite nature of the term involving the vector potential.</description>

      <title>Sharp Quantitative Stability of the Dirichlet spectrum near the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be an open set with the same volume as the unit ball $B$ and let $\lambda_k(\Omega)$ be the $k$-th eigenvalue of the Laplace operator of $\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$. In this work, we answer the following question: if $\lambda_1(\Omega)-\lambda_1(B)$ is small, how large can $|\lambda_k(\Omega)-\lambda_k(B)|$ be ?
  We establish quantitative bounds of the form $|\lambda_k(\Omega)-\lambda_k(B)|\le C (\lambda_1(\Omega)-\lambda_1(B))^\alpha$ with sharp exponents $\alpha$ depending on the multiplicity of $\lambda_k(B)$. We first show that such an inequality is valid with $\alpha=1/2$ for any $k$, improving previous known results and providing the sharpest possible exponent. Then, through the study of a vectorial free boundary problem, we show that one can achieve the better exponent $\alpha=1$ if $\lambda_{k}(B)$ is simple. We also obtain a similar result for the whole cluster of eigenvalues when $\lambda_{k}(B)$ is multiple, thus providing a complete answer to the question above. As a consequence of these results, we obtain the persistence of the ball as the minimizer for a large class of spectral functionals which are small perturbations of the fundamental eigenvalue on the one hand, and a full reverse Kohler-Jobin inequality on the other hand, solving an open problem formulated by M. Van Den Berg, G. Buttazzo and A. Pratelli.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions of critical anisotropic Sobolev equation without the finite volume constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all positive solutions of the critical anisotropic Sobolev equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta^{H}_{p}u = u^{p^{*}-1}, \ \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n \end{equation*} without the finite volume constraint for $n \geq 2$ and $\frac{(n+1)}{3} \leq p &lt; n$, where $p^{*} = \frac{np}{n-p}$ denotes the critical Sobolev exponent and $-\Delta^{H}_{p}=-div(H^{p-1}(\cdot)\nabla H(\cdot))$ denotes the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator. This result removes the finite volume assumption on the classification of critical anisotropic $p$-Laplace equation which was obtained by Ciraolo-Figalli-Roncoroni in the literature \cite{CFR}. The method is based on constructing suitable vector fields integral inequality and using Newton's type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove stochastic homogenization for a class of non-convex and non-coercive first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations in a finite-range-dependence environment for Hamiltonians that can be expressed by a max-min formula. Exploiting the representation of solutions as value functions of differential games, we develop a game-theoretic approach to homogenization. We furthermore extend this result to a class of Lipschitz Hamiltonians that need not admit a global max-min representation. Our methods allow us to get a quantitative convergence rate for solutions with linear initial data toward the corresponding ones of the effective limit problem.</description>

      <title>Blowing-up solutions to competitive critical systems in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the critical system of $m\geq 2$ equations \begin{equation*} -\Delta u_i = u_i^5 + \sum_{j = 1,\,j\neq i}^m \beta_{ij} u_i^2 u_j^3\,, \quad u_i \gneqq 0 \quad \mbox{in } \mathbb{R}^3\,, \quad i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}\,, \end{equation*} where $\beta_{\kappa\ell} =\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ if $\kappa\neq\ell$, and $\beta_{\ell m}=\beta_{m \kappa} =\beta&lt;0$, for $ \kappa, \ell \in \{1,\ldots, m-1\}$. We construct solutions to this system in the case where $\beta\to-\infty$ by means of a Ljapunov-Schmidt reduction argument. This allows us to identify the explicit form of the solution at main order: $u_1$ will look like a perturbation of the standard radial positive solution to the Yamabe equation, while $u_2$ will blow-up at the $k$ vertices of a regular planar polygon. The solutions to the other equations will replicate the blowing-up structure under an appropriate rotation that ensures $u_i\neq u_j$ for $i\neq j$. The result provides the first almost-explicit example of non-synchronized solutions to competitive critical systems in dimension 3.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a second order, linear, fully decoupled, and unconditionally energy stable scheme for solving the Erickson-Leslie model. This approach integrates the pressure correction method with a scalar auxiliary variable technique. We rigorously demonstrate the unconditional energy stability of the proposed scheme.

      <title>Quantitative and exact concavity principles for parabolic and elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goal of this paper is to study classes of Cauchy-Dirichlet problems which include parabolic equations of the type $$u_t -\Delta u= a(x,t)f(u)\quad\hbox{in $\Omega\times(0,T)$}$$ with $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ bounded, convex domain and $T\in(0,+\infty]$. Under suitable assumptions on $a$ and $f$, we show logarithmic or power concavity (in space, or in space-time) of the solution $u$; under some relaxed assumptions on $a$, we show moreover that $u$ enjoys concavity properties up to a controlled error. The results include relevant examples like the torsion $f(u)=1$, the Lane-Emden equation $f(u)=u^q$, $q\in(0,1)$, the eigenfunction $f(u)=u$, the logarithmic equation $f(u)=u\log(u^2)$, and the saturable nonlinearity $f(u)=\frac{u^2}{1+u}$. The logistic equation $f(x,u)=a(x)u-u^2$ can be treated as well.
  Some exact results give a different approach, as well as generalizations, to [Ishige-Salani2013, Ishige-Salani2016]. Moreover, some quantitative results are valid also in the elliptic framework $-\Delta u=a(x)f(u)$ and refine [Bucur-Squassina2019, Gallo-Squassina2024].</description>

      <title>Normalized ground states for NLS equations with mass critical nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study normalized solutions $(\mu,u)\in \mathbb{R} \times H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations
  $$ -\Delta u + \mu u = g(u)\quad \hbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, \qquad \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u^2 dx = m, $$ where $N\geq 2$ and the mass $m&gt;0$ is given. Here $g$ has an $L^2$-critical growth, both at the origin and at infinity, that is $g(s)\sim |s|^{p-1}s$ as $s\sim 0$ and $s\sim\infty$, where $p=1+\frac{4}{N}$. We continue the analysis started in [Cingolani-Gallo-Ikoma-Tanaka, 2024], where we found two (possibly distinct) minimax values $\underline{b} \leq 0 \leq \overline{b}$ of the Lagrangian functional. In this paper we furnish explicit examples of $g$ satisfying $\underline{b}&lt;0&lt;\overline{b}$, $\underline{b}=0&lt;\overline{b}$ and $\underline{b}&lt;0=\overline{b}$; notice that $\underline{b}=0=\overline{b}$ in the power case $g(t)=|t|^{p-1}t$. Moreover, we deal with the existence and non-existence of a solution with minimal energy. Finally, we discuss the assumptions required on $g$ to obtain the existence of a positive solution for perturbations of $g$.</description>

      <title>Global nonlinear stability of vortex sheets for the Navier-Stokes equations with large data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the global nonlinear stability of vortex sheets for the Navier-Stokes equations. When the Mach number is small, we allow both the amplitude and vorticity of the vortex sheets to be large. We introduce an auxiliary flow and reformulate the problem as a vortex sheet with small vorticity but subjected to a large perturbation. Based on the decomposition of frequency, the largeness of the perturbation is encoded in the zero modes of the tangential velocity. We discover an essential cancellation property that there are no nonlinear interactions among these large zero modes in the zero-mode perturbed system. This cancellation is owing to the shear structure inherent in the vortex sheets. Furthermore, with the aid of the anti-derivative technique, we establish a faster decay rate for the large zero modes. These observations enable us to derive the global estimates for strong solutions that are uniform with respect to the Mach number. As a byproduct, we can justify the incompressible limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the unique recovery of time-independent lower order terms appearing in the symmetric first order perturbation of the Riemannian wave equation by sending and measuring waves in disjoint open sets of \textit{a priori} known closed Riemannian manifold. In particular, we show that if the set where we capture the waves satisfies a geometric control condition as well as a certain local symmetry condition for the distance functions, then the aforementioned measurement is sufficient to recover the lower order terms up to the natural gauge. For instance, our result holds if the complement of the receiver set is contained in a simple Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear distortion of symmetry in solutions to the convection-diffusion equation of Burgers type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the initial value problem of the convection-diffusion equation of Burgers type is treated. In the asymptotic profile of solutions, the nonlinearity of the equation is reflected. Regarding the solutions to this model, the Spanish school in the 1990s performed asymptotic expansions based on the linear diffusion. Those profiles exhibit symmetries characteristic of linear phenomena. In this paper, the distortion of symmetry arising from the nonlinear effects is described explicitly. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the extent of this distortion differs significantly depending on the parity of the spatial dimension. This contradicts the conventional expectation that the manifestation of nonlinearity depends on the scale of the equation. This interpretation is supported by comparison with similar Navier--Stokes equations. The Burgers type is applicable as an indicator for considering several bilinear problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and nonexistence of positive solutions to the Lane-Emden equations $$ -\Delta u = Q |u|^{p-2}u $$ on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as in the half-space and quadrant domains, under the zero Dirichlet boundary condition in the latter two cases. Here, $d \geq 2$, $p &gt; 0$, and $Q$ denotes a Hardy-type positive potential satisfying $Q(x) \sim (1+|x|)^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in [0, +\infty]$. \smallskip
  We identify the Sobolev super-critical regions of the parameter pair $(\alpha, p)$ for which the existence of positive solutions is established via variational methods. In contrast, within the Serrin sub-critical regions of $(\alpha, p)$, we demonstrate nonexistence by iteratively analyzing the decay behavior at infinity, ultimately leading to a contradiction. Notably, in the full-space and half-space domains, there exists an intermediate regions between the Sobolev critical line and the Serrin critical line where the existence of positive solutions remains an open question. Such an intermediate region does not exist in the quadrant domain.</description>

      <title>Propagation of singularities for equations with $C^{r}$ coefficients for $r&gt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe that, for $r&gt;1$, $s$ in an $r$-dependent interval, $p$ a homogeneous pseudodifferential symbol of order $m$ having $C^{r}$ regularity in space, and $u\in H^{s+m-r}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ such that $p(x,D)u\in H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, each point in the $H^{s+m-1}$ wavefront set of $u$ lies on a maximally extended null bicharacteristic of $p$ which is contained in the $H^{s+m-1}$ wavefront set of $u$. In fact, for $r=2$ slightly less than $C^{1,1}$ regularity suffices, and here the results apply to manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Hypocoercivity and Lifting of Classical and Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantitative convergence analysis for hypocoercive dynamics such as Langevin and Lindblad equations describing classical and quantum open systems. Our goal is to provide an overview of recent results of hypocoercivity estimates based on space-time Poincare inequality, providing a unified treatment for classical and quantum dynamics. Furthermore, we also present a unified lifting framework for accelerating both classical and quantum Markov semigroups, which leads to upper and lower bounds of convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Stochastic perturbation and zero noise limit for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar conservation laws sit at the intersection between being simple enough to study analytically, while being complex enough to exhibit a wide range of nonlinear phenomena. We introduce a novel stochastic perturbation of scalar conservation laws, inspired by mean field games. We prove well-posedness of the stochastically perturbed equation; prove that it converges as the noise parameter is sent to $0$; and that the limit is the unique entropy solution of the conservation law. Thus, the noise acts as a selection criterion for (deterministic) conservation laws. This is the first such result for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>

      <title>A mild rough Gronwall Lemma with applications to non-autonomous evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a Gronwall type inequality for mild solutions of non-autonomous parabolic rough partial differential equations (RPDEs). This inequality together with an analysis of the Cameron-Martin space associated to the noise, allows us to obtain the existence of moments of all order for the solution of the corresponding RPDE and its Jacobian when the random input is given by a Gaussian Volterra process. Applying further the multiplicative ergodic theorem, these integrable bounds entail the existence of Lyapunov exponents for RPDEs. We illustrate these results for stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative boundary noise.</description>

      <title>An ansatz for constructing explicit solutions of Hessian equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a (variation of quadrics) ansatz for constructing explicit, real-valued solutions to broad classes of complex Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ and real Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the complex setting, our method simultaneously addresses the deformed Hermitian--Yang--Mills/Leung--Yau--Zaslow (dHYM/LYZ) equation, the Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation, and the $J$-equation. Under this ansatz each PDE reduces to a second-order system of ordinary differential equations admitting explicit first integrals. These ODE systems integrate in closed form via abelian integrals, producing wide families of explicit solutions together with a detailed description. In particular, on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, we construct entire dHYM/LYZ solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase, and on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ we produce entire special Lagrangian solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase. Some of these solutions develop singularities on compact regions. In the special Lagrangian case we show that, after a natural extension across the singular locus, these blow-up solutions coincide with previously known complete special Lagrangian submanifolds obtained via a different ansatz.</description>
