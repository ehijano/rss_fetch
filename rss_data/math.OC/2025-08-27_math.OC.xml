      <title>Dynamic System Optimum: A Projection-based Framework for Macroscopic Traffic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the theoretical grounds for emulating the Dynamic System Optimum with desired arrival times on regional networks, using aggregated traffic dynamics based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram. We used a projection gradient-based solution method that avoids the need to compute approximations of marginal travel times. We demonstrate the application of our framework on 8-region networks and show that our approach yields improved solutions compared to classical approximation methods in the literature, such as the Method of Successive Averages and the gap-based approach.</description>

      <title>A second-order cone representable class of nonconvex quadratic programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a sparse nonconvex quadratic function over the unit hypercube. By developing an extension of the Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) to continuous quadratic sets, we propose a novel second-order cone (SOC) representable relaxation for this problem. By exploiting the sparsity of the quadratic function, we establish a sufficient condition under which the convex hull of the feasible region of the linearized problem is SOC-representable. While the proposed formulation may be of exponential size in general, we identify additional structural conditions that guarantee the existence of a polynomial-size SOC-representable formulation, which can be constructed in polynomial time. Under these conditions, the optimal value of the nonconvex quadratic program coincides with that of a polynomial-size second-order cone program. Our results serve as a starting point for bridging the gap between the Boolean quadric polytope of sparse problems and its continuous counterpart.</description>

      <title>Norm-Constrained Flows and Sign-Based Optimization: Theory and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign Gradient Descent (SignGD) is a simple yet robust optimization method, widely used in machine learning for its resilience to gradient noise and compatibility with low-precision computations. While its empirical performance is well established, its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we revisit SignGD from a continuous-time perspective, showing that it arises as an Euler discretization of a norm-constrained gradient flow. This viewpoint reveals a trust-region interpretation and connects SignGD to a broader class of methods defined by different norm constraints, such as normalized gradient descent and greedy coordinate descent.
  We further study the discontinuous nature of the underlying dynamics using Filippov's differential inclusion framework, which allows us to derive new algorithmic variants, such as the convex-combination sliding update for the $\ell_1$-constrained flow, that faithfully approximate Filippov solutions even at discontinuity points. While we do not provide convergence guarantees for these variants, we demonstrate that they preserve descent properties and perform well empirically. We also introduce an accelerated version of SignGD based on a momentum-augmented discretization of the sign-gradient flow, and show its effectiveness in practice. Finally, we establish provable convergence guarantees for standard SignGD in the setting of strongly convex optimization. Our results provide new geometric, algorithmic, and analytical insights into SignGD and its norm-constrained extensions.</description>

      <title>Log-Linear Reaction Quotient Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks in living cells maintain precise control over thousands of metabolites despite operating far from equilibrium under constant perturbations. While mass action kinetics accurately describe the underlying dynamics, the resulting nonlinear differential equations are difficult to analyze and control, particularly for large networks. We propose a simplified model where reaction quotients (the ratios that measure how far reactions are from equilibrium) evolve exponentially toward their equilibrium values when viewed on a logarithmic scale. This principle leads to linear dynamics in log-space, providing several key advantages: analytical solutions exist for arbitrary network topologies, thermodynamic constraints are automatically satisfied through the relationship between reaction quotients and Gibbs free energy, conservation laws decouple from reaction quotient dynamics simplifying both analysis and control design, and external energy sources couple linearly to the dynamics, unifying diverse biological regulatory mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Reformulations of Quadratic Programs for Lipschitz Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization-based controllers often lack regularity guarantees, such as Lipschitz continuity, when multiple constraints are present. When used to control a dynamical system, these conditions are essential to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the system's trajectory. Here we propose a general method to convert a Quadratic Program (QP) into a Second-Order Cone Problem (SOCP), which is shown to be Lipschitz continuous. Key features of our approach are that (i) the regularity of the resulting formulation does not depend on the structural properties of the constraints, such as the linear independence of their gradients; and (ii) it admits a closed-form solution, which is not available for general QPs with multiple constraints, enabling faster computation. We support our method with rigorous analysis and examples.</description>

      <title>A Markovian Approach for Cross-Category Complementarity in Choice Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While single-purchase choice models have been widely studied in assortment optimization, customers in modern retail and e-commerce environments often purchase multiple items across distinct product categories, exhibiting both substitution and complementarity. We consider the cross-category assortment optimization problem where retailers jointly determine assortments across categories to maximize expected revenue. Most prior work on the topic either overlooks complementarity or proposes models that lead to intractable optimization problems, despite being based on the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model. We propose a sequential multi-purchase choice model for cross-category choice that incorporates complementarity through a Markovian transition structure across categories, while allowing general Random Utility Maximization (RUM)-based choice models to capture the within-category substitution. We develop an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for estimation, and a polynomial-time algorithm for unconstrained assortment optimization that yields the optimal solution when the within-category substitution follows a Markov chain choice model.
  Furthermore, we introduce an empirical metric to quantify complementarity strength across product categories and conduct extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic data and a large-scale transaction-level dataset from a major US grocery store. Our model yields improvements in predictive accuracy, model fit, and expected revenue in setting with complementarity, and it reveals intuitive market structures such as brand-loyal cross-category purchasing. Overall, we believe that our model provides a theoretically-grounded and practical framework for modeling complementarity and making better cross-category assortment decisions.</description>

      <title>Rebalancing Modular Transit Systems: A Hierarchical Graph-Based Optimization Framework for Fleet Sizing and Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the rebalancing of empty modular transit pods between scheduled service trips in fixed-route bus systems. A two-stage hierarchical optimization framework is proposed. The first stage determines the minimum fleet size and initial vehicle assignments by solving a maximum matching problem on a bipartite graph, using a GPU-accelerated push-relabel algorithm. The second stage formulates detailed routing as a series of minimum-cost flow problems on time-space networks. To manage memory usage in large instances, a capped-interval heuristic limits the size of each network by dividing long scheduling intervals into subintervals. Computational experiments on the Manhattan bus network show that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to the full-scale time-space network formulation in terms of objective value, while enabling the solution of instances that are otherwise intractable due to memory limitations.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Constrained Optimization: Constrained Gradient Flows via Reparameterization: A-Stable Implicit Schemes, KKT from Stationarity, and Geometry-Respecting Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-flow (GF) viewpoints unify and illuminate optimization algorithms. Yet most GF analyses focus on unconstrained settings. We develop a geometry-respecting framework for constrained problems by (i) reparameterizing feasible sets with maps whose Jacobians vanish on the boundary (orthant/box) or are rank \(n{-}1\) (simplex), (ii) deriving flows in the parameter space which induce feasible primal dynamics, (iii) discretizing with A-stable implicit schemes solvable by robust inner loops (Modified Gauss-Newton or a KL-prox (negative-entropy) inner solver), and (iv) proving that stationarity of the dynamics implies KKT-with complementary slackness arising from a simple kinematic mechanism (''null speed'' or ''constant dual speed with vanishing Jacobian''). We also give a Stiefel-manifold treatment where Riemannian stationarity coincides with KKT. These results yield efficient, geometry-respecting algorithms for each constraint class. We include a brief A-stability discussion and present numerical tests (NNLS, simplex- and box-constrained least squares, orthogonality) demonstrating stability, accuracy, and runtime efficiency of the implicit schemes.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing SAA and DRO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-makers often encounter uncertainty, and the distribution of uncertain parameters plays a crucial role in making reliable decisions. However, complete information is rarely available. The sample average approximation (SAA) approach utilizes historical data to address this, but struggles with insufficient data. Conversely, moment-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) effectively employs partial distributional information but can yield conservative solutions even with ample data. To bridge these approaches, we propose a novel method called harmonizing optimization (HO), which integrates SAA and DRO by adaptively adjusting the weights of data and information based on sample size N. This allows HO to amplify data effects in large samples while emphasizing information in smaller ones. More importantly, HO performs well across varying data sizes without needing to classify them as large or small. We provide practical methods for determining these weights and demonstrate that HO offers finite-sample performance guarantees, proving asymptotic optimality when the weight of information follows a 1/\sqrt{N}-rate. In addition, HO can be applied to enhance scenario reduction, improving approximation quality and reducing completion time by retaining critical information from reduced scenarios. Numerical results show significant advantages of HO in solution quality compared to Wasserstein-based DRO, and highlight its effectiveness in scenario reduction.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of a Forward-Backward-Forward Differential Equation and Its Discrete Version for Solving Quasimonotone Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of a forward-backward-forward (FBF) type differential equation and its discrete counterpart for solving quasimonotone variational inequalities (VIs). Building on recent continuous-time dynamical system frameworks for VIs, we extend these methods to accommodate quasimonotone operators. We establish weak and strong convergence under significantly relaxed conditions, without requiring strong pseudomonotonicity or sequential weak-to-weak continuity. Additionally, we prove ergodic convergence of the continuous trajectories, offering further insight into the long-term stability of the system. In the discrete setting, we propose a novel Bregman-type algorithm that incorporates a nonmonotone adaptive step-size rule based on the golden ratio technique. A key contribution of this work is demonstrating that the proposed method ensures strong convergence under the assumption of uniform continuity of the operator, thereby relaxing the standard Lipschitz continuity requirement prevalent in existing methods. Numerical experiments, including infinite-dimensional and non-Lipschitz cases, are presented to illustrate the improved convergence and broader applicability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Quick Estimation of Fr\'echet Quantizers for a Dynamic Solution to Flood Risk Management Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-stage stochastic optimization is a well-known quantitative tool for decision-making under uncertainty. It is broadly used in financial and investment planning, inventory control, and also natural disaster risk management. Theoretical solutions of multi-stage stochastic programs can be found explicitly only in very exceptional cases due to their variational form and interdependency of uncertainty in time. Nevertheless, numerical solutions are often inaccurate, as they rely on Monte-Carlo sampling, which requires the Law of Large Numbers to hold for the approximation quality. In this article, we introduce a new approximation scheme, which computes and groups together stage-wise optimal quantizers of conditional Fr\'echet distributions for optimal weighting of value functions in the dynamic programming. We consider optimality of scenario quantization methods in the sense of minimal Kantorovich-Wasserstein distance at each stage of the scenario tree. By this, we bound the approximation error with convergence guarantees. We also provide global solution guarantees under convexity and monotonicity conditions on the value function. We apply the developed methods to the governmental budget allocation problem for risk management of flood events in Austria. For this, we propose an extremely efficient way to approximate optimal quantizers for conditional Fr\'echet distributions. Our approach allows to enhance the overall efficiency of dynamic programming via the use of different parameter estimation methods for different groups of quantizers. The groups are distinguished by a particular risk threshold and are able to differentiate between higher- and lower-impact flood events.</description>

      <title>An optimistic planning algorithm for switched discrete-time LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TROOP, a tree-based Riccati optimistic online planner, that is designed to generate near-optimal control laws for discrete-time switched linear systems with switched quadratic costs. The key challenge that we address is balancing computational resources against control performance, which is important as constructing near-optimal inputs often requires substantial amount of computations. TROOP addresses this trade-off by adopting an online best-first search strategy inspired by A*, allowing for efficient estimates of the optimal value function. The control laws obtained guarantee both near-optimality and stability properties for the closed-loop system. These properties depend on the planning depth, which determines how far into the future the algorithm explores and is closely related to the amount of computations. TROOP thus strikes a balance between computational efficiency and control performance, which is illustrated by numerical simulations on an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of designing adaptive stepsize sequences for the gradient descent method applied to convex and locally smooth functions is studied. We take an adaptive control perspective and design update rules for the stepsize that make use of both past (measured) and future (predicted) information. We show that Lyapunov analysis can guide in the systematic design of adaptive parameters striking a balance between convergence rates and robustness to computational errors or inexact gradient information. Theoretical and numerical results indicate that closed-loop adaptation guided by system theory is a promising approach for designing new classes of adaptive optimization algorithms with improved convergence properties.</description>

      <title>A New Inexact Manifold Proximal Linear Algorithm with Adaptive Stopping Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the nonsmooth and nonconvex composite optimization on Riemannian manifolds. We propose a new inexact manifold proximal linear algorithm (IManPL) that incorporates both high- and low-accuracy conditions. At each iteration, IManPL solves convex subproblems on tangent spaces inexactly, guided by two adaptive stopping criteria. We establish convergence guarantees and show that IManPL achieves the best iteration complexity for solving the nonsmooth manifold composite optimization. Numerical experiments on the sparse spectral clustering (SSC) and the sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches, including the manifold proximal linear algorithm and manifold proximal gradient algorithm.</description>

      <title>Distributed Implementation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver to Solve QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a distributed algorithm and implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), termed distributed VQE (DVQE). DVQE, provided as an open-source Python package, enables the execution of parameterized quantum circuits across multiple logical quantum processing units (QPUs) in a distributed fashion. This approach addresses key hardware limitations of near-term quantum devices, including restricted qubit counts and limited circuit depth. Distributed ansatz circuits are constructed to preserve the quantum state fidelity of their monolithic counterparts, allowing consistent energy estimation while distributing the computational load. To improve the convergence and robustness of the optimization loop for identifying the variational parameters of the DVQE ansatz circuit, we use the ADAM optimizer in combination with metaheuristic initialization strategies, which outperform random initialization across various test cases. The complete DVQE pipeline is implemented in a modular Python package that accepts QUBO problems as input and supports monolithic and distributed execution modes. The framework leverages Qiskit to construct and simulate distributed circuits, and includes an internal greedy algorithm for automatic qubit allocation across multiple QPUs. Simulation results on QUBO benchmarks confirm the correctness of the approach, paving the way for real QPU deployment and further exploration of distributed quantum optimization. \textbf{The simulator is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DVQE.git}{GitHub} under a package named raiselab, with a collection of tutorial examples.}</description>

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of vector valued functions by combining operator valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (OV-RKHS) with kernel based Koopman operator methods. The approach enables nonparametric and data driven estimation of complex time evolving vector fields while preserving both spatial and temporal structure. We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations. This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio- temporal machine learning.</description>

      <title>Max-Min and 1-Bounded Space Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \&amp; Fractals 2016] proposed an approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of $MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin packing problem.</description>

      <title>Learning Binary Sampling Patterns for Single-Pixel Imaging using Bilevel Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy. We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly undersampled regimes.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Goal-Oriented Medium Access: Protocol Design and Distributed Bandit Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) paradigm breaks the separation between communication and the content of the data, tailoring communication decisions to the specific needs of the receiver and targeting application performance. While recent studies show impressive encoding performance in point-to-point scenarios, the multi-node distributed scenario is still almost unexplored. Moreover, the few studies to investigate this consider a centralized collision-free approach, where a central scheduler decides the transmission order of the nodes. In this work, we address the Goal-oriented Multiple Access (GoMA) problem, in which multiple intelligent agents must coordinate to share a wireless channel and avoid mutual interference. We propose a theoretical framework for the analysis and optimization of distributed GoMA, serving as a first step towards its complete characterization. We prove that the problem is non-convex and may admit multiple Nash Equilibrium (NE) solutions. We provide a characterization of each node's best response to others' strategies and propose an optimization approach that provably reaches one such NE, outperforming centralized approaches by up to 100% while also reducing energy consumption. We also design a distributed learning algorithm that operates with limited feedback and no prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Evaluation and Routing in Public Transport Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both evaluating the service quality of a public transport system and understanding how passengers choose between modes or routes is imperative for public transport operators, providers of competing mobility services and policy makers. However, the literature does not offer consensus on how either of these tasks should be performed, which can lead to inconsistent or counter-intuitive results. This paper provides a formal treatment on how fundamental elements of public transport systems (route sets, timetables and line plans) can be evaluated consistently, and how travelers distribute over routes. Our main insight is that evaluation and routing are two sides of the same coin: by solving an appropriate optimization model one obtains both the quality of the route set, timetable or line plan (the optimal objective value), and the distribution of the travelers over the routes (the optimal solution itself). The practical relevance of the new framework is demonstrated with several applications that are validated with real data from the Dutch and Swiss railway networks. The measures and route choice models developed in this paper enable planners to create better line plans and to effectively analyze timetables for inefficiencies. The framework also reveals: (i) the importance of using the right model for the right stage of planning, (ii) that it is not always necessary for public transport planners to accurately model travel behavior, especially for high-level planning, and (iii) that combining models in an inconsistent way can have significant negative consequences that are avoided with the new framework.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Sizing of a Rocket Family with Embedded Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a sizing procedure for a rocket family capable of fulfilling multiple missions, considering the commonalities between the vehicles. The procedure aims to take full advantage of sharing a common part across multiple rockets whose payload capability differs entirely, ultimately leading to cost savings in designing a rocket family. As the foundation of the proposed rocket family design method, an integrated sizing method with trajectory optimization for a single rocket is first formulated as a single optimal control problem. This formulation can find the optimal sizing along with trajectory results in a tractable manner. Building upon this formulation, the proposed rocket family design method is developed to 1) determine the feasible design space of the rocket family design problem (i.e., commonality check), and 2) if a feasible design space is determined to exist, minimize the cost function within that feasible space by solving an optimization problem in which the optimal control problem is embedded as a subproblem. A case study is carried out on a rocket family composed of expendable and reusable launchers to demonstrate the novelty of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Frank-Wolfe algorithm for DC optimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we formulate two versions of Frank--Wolfe algorithm or conditional gradient method to solve the DC optimization problem with an adaptive step size. The DC objective function consists of two components; the first is thought to be differentiable with a continuous Lipschitz gradient, while the second is only thought to be convex. The second version is based on the first and employs finite differences to approximate the gradient of the first component of the objective function. In contrast to past formulations that used the curvature/Lipschitz-type constant of the objective function, the step size computed does not require any constant associated with the components. For the first version, we established that the algorithm is well-defined of the algorithm and that every limit point of the generated sequence is a stationary point of the problem. We also introduce the class of weak-star-convex functions and show that, despite the fact that these functions are non-convex in general, the rate of convergence of the first version of the algorithm to minimize these functions is ${\cal O}(1/k)$. The finite difference used to approximate the gradient in the second version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is computed with the step-size adaptively updated using two previous iterations. Unlike previous applications of finite difference in the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which provided approximate gradients with absolute error, the one used here provides us with a relative error, simplifying the algorithm analysis. In this case, we show that all limit points of the generated sequence for the second version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm are stationary points for the problem under consideration, and we establish that the rate of convergence for the duality gap is ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{k})$.</description>

      <title>Golf Strategy Optimization and the "Drive for show, putt for dough" adage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores strategic decision-making in professional golf's Stroke Play format through a computational lens. We develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model-specifically, a stochastic shortest path formulation-to optimize a golfer's strategy on any given course, incorporating both course layout and player skill data. While MDPs have been widely used in sports analytics, applying them to golf presents significant scalability challenges due to the curse of dimensionality. Our primary objective is not to predict player performance with high precision, but rather to demonstrate that an exact, data-driven MDP approach is computationally tractable on full scale, real-world instances. We show that, with careful problem structuring, low-level coding, and efficient memory management, it is possible to solve such large-scale models without resorting to heuristics or Q-learning approximations, as used in existing approaches. To illustrate the model's potential, we show how one can use PGA Tour data and aerial course imagery to simulate strategic outcomes and analyze how different skill profiles influence performance. In particular, we assess the relative impact of driving and putting, challenging the popular adage "Drive for show, putt for dough." These results support the value of our methodology as a robust proof of concept and a foundation for future enhancements. All code and analyses (in R and C++) are made available as open-source resources to support reproducibility and further research.</description>

Abstract: We use a dynamic programming approach to construct management strategies for a hydropower plant with a dam and a continuously adjustable unit. Along the way, we estimate unknown variables via simple models using historical data and forecasts. Our suggested scheme achieves on average 97.1 % of the theoretical maximum using small computational effort. We also apply our scheme to a Run-of-River hydropower plant and compare the strategies and results to the much more involved PDE-based optimal switching method studied earlier by the authors in (Optimization and Engineering (2021): 1-25); this comparison shows that our simple approach may be preferable if the underlying data is sufficiently rich.</description>

      <title>Source reconstruction algorithms for coupled parabolic systems from internal measurements of one scalar state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of source reconstruction algorithms for coupled systems of heat equations, with either constant or spatially dependent coupling terms, where internal measurements are available from a reduced number of observed states. Two classes of systems are considered. The first comprises parabolic equations with constant zero-order coupling terms (through a matrix potential term or via the diffusion matrix). The second type considers parabolic equations coupled by a matrix potential that depends on spatial variables, which leads to the analysis of a non-self-adjoint operator. In all configurations, the source is assumed to be of separate variables, the temporal part is a known scalar function, and the spatial dependence is an unknown vector field. Several numerical examples using the finite element method in 1D and 2D are presented to show the reconstruction of space-dependent sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the surmounting interest for dedicated infrastructure in cislunar space, this work considers the satellite constellation design for cislunar space situational awareness (CSSA). We propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based formulation that simultaneously tackles the constellation design and sensor-tasking subproblems surrounding CSSA. Our approach generates constellation designs that provide coverage with considerations for the field-of-view of observers. We propose a time-expanded p-Median problem (TE-p-MP) which considers the optimal placement of p space-based observers into discretized locations based on orbital slots along libration point orbits, simultaneously with observer pointing directions across discretized time. We further develop a Lagrangian method for the TE-p-MP, where a relaxed problem with an analytical solution is derived, and customized heuristics leveraging the orbital structure of candidate observer locations are devised. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated with several case studies for CSSA constellations monitoring the cislunar Cone of Shame and a periodic time-varying transit window for low-energy transfers located in the Earth-Moon L2 neck region. The proposed problem formulation, along with the Lagrangian method, is demonstrated to enable a fast assessment of near-optimal CSSA constellations, equipping decision-makers with a critical technique for exploring the design trade space.</description>

      <title>A simple and practical adaptive trust-region method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an adaptive trust-region method for unconstrained optimization that allows inexact solutions to the trust-region subproblems. Our method is a simple variant of the classical trust-region method of \citet{sorensen1982newton}. The method achieves the best possible convergence bound up to an additive log factor, for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point, i.e., $O( \Delta_f L^{1/2} \epsilon^{-3/2}) + \tilde{O}(1)$ iterations where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, $\Delta_f$ is the optimality gap, and $\epsilon$ is the termination tolerance for the gradient norm. This improves over existing trust-region methods whose worst-case bound is at least a factor of $L$ worse. We compare our performance with state-of-the-art trust-region (TRU) and cubic regularization (ARC) methods from the GALAHAD library on the CUTEst benchmark set on problems with more than 100 variables. We use fewer function, gradient, and Hessian evaluations than these methods. For instance, our algorithm's median number of gradient evaluations is $23$ compared to $36$ for TRU and $29$ for ARC.
  Compared to the conference version of this paper \cite{hamad2022consistently}, our revised method includes several practical enhancements. These modifications dramatically improved performance, including an order of magnitude reduction in the shifted geometric mean of wall-clock times. We also show it suffices for the second derivatives to be locally Lipschitz to guarantee that either the minimum gradient norm converges to zero or the objective value tends towards negative infinity, even when the iterates diverge.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Fault Detection Trade-off Design with Prior Fault Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robustness of fault detection algorithms against uncertainty is crucial in the real-world industrial environment. Recently, a new probabilistic design scheme called distributionally robust fault detection (DRFD) has emerged and received immense interest. Despite its robustness against unknown distributions in practice, current DRFD focuses on the overall detectability of all possible faults rather than the detectability of critical faults that are a priori known. Henceforth, a new DRFD trade-off design scheme is put forward in this work by utilizing prior fault information. The key contribution includes a novel distributional robustness metric of detecting a known fault and a new relaxed distributionally robust chance constraint that ensures robust detectability. Then, a new DRFD design problem of fault detection under unknown probability distributions is proposed, and this offers a flexible balance between the robustness of detecting known critical faults and the overall detectability against all possible faults. To solve the resulting semi-infinite chance-constrained problem, we first reformulate it to a finite-dimensional problem characterized by bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). Subsequently, a customized solution algorithm is developed, which includes a sequential optimization procedure and an initialization strategy. Finally, case studies on a simulated three-tank system and a real-world battery cell are carried out to showcase the usefulness of our DRFD method.</description>

      <title>Bushfires and Balance: Proactive versus Reactive Policies in Prescribed Burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new mathematical model to explore the dynamic relationship between prescribed burning and bushfire occurrence, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations. The model admits a unique steady-state, and its stability is shown to depend critically on the policy framework governing prescribed burning. In particular, reactive policies, where prescribed burning is increased in response to bushfire events, can lead to system instability unless augmented with appropriate feedback control. Conversely, proactive policies that implement moderate, consistent prescribed burning are more effective at stabilizing the system and mitigating the frequency of bushfires. Additionally, higher vegetation regeneration rates contribute positively to equilibrium stability. While this model does not capture the full complexity of fire management, it highlights the potential risks of emotionally driven, reactive responses and underscores the value of preventive, stability-focused strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mathematical analysis of preventive burning strategies and their long-term impact on bushfire mitigation.</description>

      <title>Orbital Depot Location Optimization for Satellite Constellation Servicing with Low-Thrust Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical problem of co-optimizing the optimal locations for orbital depots and the sequence of in-space servicing for a satellite constellation. While most traditional studies used network optimization for this problem, assuming a fixed set of discretized nodes in the network (i.e., a limited number of depot location candidates), this work is unique in that it develops a method to optimize the depot location in continuous space. The problem is formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming, and we propose a solution methodology that iteratively solves two decoupled problems: one using mixed-integer linear programming and the other using nonlinear programming with an analytic transfer solution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply this methodology to a case study involving a GPS satellite constellation. Numerical experiments confirm the stability of our proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Online Learning in Symmetric Cone Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce symmetric cone games (SCGs), a broad class of multi-player games where each player's strategy lies in a generalized simplex (the trace-one slice of a symmetric cone). This framework unifies a wide spectrum of settings, including normal-form games (simplex strategies), quantum games (density matrices), and continuous games with ball-constrained strategies. It also captures several structured machine learning and optimization problems, such as distance metric learning and Fermat-Weber facility location, as two-player zero-sum SCGs. To compute approximate Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum SCGs, we propose a single online learning algorithm: Optimistic Symmetric Cone Multiplicative Weights Updates (OSCMWU). Unlike prior methods tailored to specific geometries, OSCMWU provides closed-form, projection-free updates over any symmetric cone and achieves an optimal $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$ iteration complexity for computing $\epsilon$-saddle points. Our analysis builds on the Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework and hinges on a key technical contribution: We prove that the symmetric cone negative entropy is strongly convex with respect to the trace-one norm. This result extends known results for the simplex and spectraplex to all symmetric cones, and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Update Method for Exponential Family Projection Filters with Non-Conjugate Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The projection filter is one of the approximations to the solution of the optimal filtering problem. It approximates the filtering density by projecting the dynamics of the square-root filtering density onto the tangent space of the square-root parametric density manifold. While the projection filters for exponential and mixture families with continuous measurement processes have been well studied, the continuous-discrete projection filtering algorithm for non-conjugate priors has received less attention.
  In this paper, we introduce a simple Riemannian optimization method to be used for the Bayesian update step in the continuous-discrete projection filter for exponential families. Specifically, we show that the Bayesian update can be formulated as an optimization problem of $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergence, where the corresponding Riemannian gradient can be easily computed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method via two highly non-Gaussian Bayesian update problems.</description>

      <title>On Discounted Infinite-Time Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the infinite-time mean field games with discounting, establishing an equilibrium where individual optimal strategies collectively regenerate the mean-field distribution. To solve this problem, we partition all agents into a representative player and the social equilibrium. When the optimal strategy of the representative player shares the same feedback form with the strategy of the social equilibrium, we say the system achieves a Nash equilibrium.
  We construct a Nash equilibrium using the stochastic maximum principle and infinite-time forward-backward stochastic differential equations(FBSDEs). By employing the elliptic master equations, a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs , we provide a representation for the Nash equilibrium. We prove the Yamada-Watanabe theorem and show the weak uniqueness for infinite-time FBSDEs. And we prove that the solutions to a system of infinite-time FBSDEs can be employed to construct viscosity solutions for a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>A Fully Adaptive Frank-Wolfe Algorithm for Relatively Smooth Problems and Its Application to Centralized Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for constrained optimization problems with relatively smooth objectives. Building upon our previous work, we propose a fully adaptive variant of the Frank-Wolfe method that dynamically adjusts the step size. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the function parameters and guarantees convergence using only local information. We establish a linear convergence rate under relative strong convexity and provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed adaptive step-size rule.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate how relative smoothness and strong convexity naturally arise in the setting of centralized distributed optimization. Under a variance-type assumption on the gradients, we show that the global objective becomes relatively strongly convex with respect to the Bregman divergence generated by a local function. This structure allows us to apply our adaptive Frank-Wolfe algorithm, leading to provable acceleration due to an improved relative condition number.</description>

      <title>The Reconfigurable Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth observation satellites (EOS) play a pivotal role in capturing and analyzing planetary phenomena, ranging from natural disasters to societal development. The EOS scheduling problem (EOSSP), which optimizes the schedule of EOS, is often solved with respect to nadir-directional EOS systems, thus restricting the observation time of targets and, consequently, the effectiveness of each EOS. This paper leverages state-of-the-art constellation reconfigurability to develop the reconfigurable EOS scheduling problem (REOSSP), wherein EOS are assumed to be maneuverable, forming a more optimal constellation configuration at multiple opportunities during a schedule. This paper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the REOSSP to optimally solve the scheduling problem for given parameters. Additionally, since the REOSSP can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems, a rolling horizon procedure (RHP) solution method is developed. The performance of the REOSSP is benchmarked against the EOSSP, which serves as a baseline, through a set of random instances where problem characteristics are varied and a case study in which Hurricane Sandy is used to demonstrate realistic performance. These experiments demonstrate the value of constellation reconfigurability in its application to the EOSSP, yielding solutions that improve performance, while the RHP enhances computational runtime for large-scale REOSSP instances.</description>

      <title>Computational Methods and Verification Theorem for Portfolio-Consumption Optimization under Exponential O-U Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of optimal portfolio-consumption policies in a multi-asset financial market, where the n risky assets follow Exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, along with one risk-free bond. The investor's preferences are modeled using Constant Relative Risk Aversion utility with state-dependent stochastic discounting. The problem can be formulated as a high-dimensional stochastic optimal control problem, wherein the associated value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which constitutes a necessary condition for optimality. We apply a variable separation technique to transform the HJB equation to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then a class of hybrid numerical approaches that integrate exponential Rosenbrock-type methods with Runge-Kutta methods is proposed to solve the ODE system. More importantly, we establish a rigorous verification theorem that provides sufficient conditions for the existence of value function and admissible optimal control, which can be verified numerically. A series of experiments are performed, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms the conventional grid-based method in both accuracy and computational cost. Furthermore, the numerically derived optimal policy achieves superior performance over all other considered admissible policies.</description>

      <title>Chapter 7 Multi-Criteria Decision-Making: Reference-Type Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter describes selected reference-type multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that rank alternatives by comparing them with one or more reference solutions derived from an alternatives-criteria matrix (ACM). After explaining the idea of constructing positive ideal, negative ideal and/or average reference solutions, the chapter details the algorithmic steps of each method, illustrating them with a common ACM example. The 9 methods covered are: Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Gray/Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), Multi-attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC), Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS), Proximity Indexed Value (PIV), Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking According to Compromise Solution (MARCOS) and Preference Ranking on the Basis of Ideal-average Distance (PROBID). The advantages (e.g., computational simplicity) and limitations (e.g., susceptibility to rank reversal) of each method are discussed. A consolidated summary highlights how the different treatments of reference solutions can ultimately drive variations in the ranking of alternatives, underscoring the value of applying several methods in practice. By studying this chapter, readers can (1) describe the principles and steps of each reference-type method, (2) implement them on an ACM, and (3) choose an appropriate reference-type method for their decision-making problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Classification Trees Robust to Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning classification trees that are robust to distribution shifts between training and testing/deployment data. This problem arises frequently in high stakes settings such as public health and social work where data is often collected using self-reported surveys which are highly sensitive to e.g., the framing of the questions, the time when and place where the survey is conducted, and the level of comfort the interviewee has in sharing information with the interviewer. We propose a method for learning optimal robust classification trees based on mixed-integer robust optimization technology. In particular, we demonstrate that the problem of learning an optimal robust tree can be cast as a single-stage mixed-integer robust optimization problem with a highly nonlinear and discontinuous objective. We reformulate this problem equivalently as a two-stage linear robust optimization problem for which we devise a tailored solution procedure based on constraint generation. We evaluate the performance of our approach on numerous publicly available datasets, and compare the performance to a regularized, non-robust optimal tree. We show an increase of up to 12.48% in worst-case accuracy and of up to 4.85% in average-case accuracy across several datasets and distribution shifts from using our robust solution in comparison to the non-robust one.</description>

      <title>Solving Fredholm Integral Equations of the Second Kind via Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent method for approximate solution of Fredholm equations of the first kind, we develop a corresponding method for a class of Fredholm equations of the \emph{second kind}. In particular, we consider the class of equations for which the solution is a probability measure. The approach centres around specifying a functional whose gradient flow admits a minimizer corresponding to a regularized version of the solution of the underlying equation and using a mean-field particle system to approximately simulate that flow. Theoretical support for the method is presented, along with some illustrative numerical results.</description>

      <title>Aging-aware Energy Management for Residential Multi-Carrier Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to the nonlinear device dynamics, uncertainty, and computational issues. As such, energy management systems seek to decide the power dispatch in the best way possible. The objective is to minimize and balance operative costs (energy bills or asset degradation) with user requirements (mobility, heating, etc.). Current energy management uses empirical battery ageing models outside of their specific fitting conditions, resulting in inaccuracies and poor performance. Moreover, the link to thermal systems is also overlooked. This paper presents an ageing-aware day-ahead algorithm for electrified buildings that incorporates physics-based battery ageing models. The models distinguish between energy storage systems and make explicit the trade-off between grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed day-ahead algorithm can either cut down on grid costs or extend battery lifetime (electric vehicle or stationary battery packs). Moreover, it exploits the differences between cathode chemistries improving grid costs by 25% when using LFP cells, with respect to NMC cells. Finally, the performance using aged batteries is also enhanced with 35% grid cost observed savings, when passing from new to aged batteries in the summer.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Promoting Reachability Analysis and Optimization of Constrained Zonotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The constrained zonotope is a polytopic set representation widely used for set-based analysis and control of dynamic systems. This paper develops methods to formulate and solve optimization problems for dynamic systems in real time using constrained zonotope reachability analysis. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented that makes efficient use of the constrained zonotope structure. To increase the efficiency of the ADMM iterations, reachability calculations are presented that increase the sparsity of the matrices used to define a constrained zonotope when compared to typical methods. The developed methods are used to formulate and solve predictive control, state estimation, and safety verification problems. Numerical results show that optimization times using the proposed approach are competitive with state-of-the-art QP solvers and conventional problem formulations. A combined set-valued state estimation and moving horizon estimation algorithm is presented and experimentally demonstrated in the context of robot localization.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</description>

      <title>Realizing Reduced and Sparse Biochemical Reaction Networks from Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a direct optimization framework for learning reduced and sparse chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from time-series trajectory data. In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.</description>
