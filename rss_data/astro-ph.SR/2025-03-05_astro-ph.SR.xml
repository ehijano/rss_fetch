      <title>The landscape of binary core-collapse supernova progenitors and the late emergence of Wolf-Rayet winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors are massive stars in multiple systems, and their evolution and final fate are affected by interactions with their companions. These interactions can explain the presence of circumstellar material in many CCSNe, and the inferred low mass in stripped-envelope supernova progenitors. Through binary interactions, stars can gain mass, lose mass, or merge, impacting their final properties. Specific sub-types of binary interaction products have been investigated but few detailed full population models exist. Using {thousands of} detailed simulations with updated prescriptions for binary interactions and winds at Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds metallicities, we follow the evolution of single massive stars, primaries in interacting binaries and coalescence products following common envelope evolution. We also follow the evolution of the surviving secondary star, with a compact companion formed from the evolutionary end of the primary star or alone if the system was disrupted in the first supernova. The endpoints of our simulations map the rich landscape of CCSN progenitors, and provide detailed mass-loss history and progenitor structures. We identify an important evolutionary phase for stripped-envelope supernova progenitors, in which the wind mass-loss rate of stars stripped by binary interaction rapidly increases in their final evolutionary stages, after core helium burning. These strong winds would give rise to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) spectral appearance, though only for a few millennia, in contrast to hundreds of millennia for their more massive WR counterparts. Such lightweight WR stars in binaries can account for observed properties of type Ib/c supernovae.</description>

      <title>The Infrared-Bright SW Knots in the Complex Ejecta of VY CMa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The red hypergiant VY CMa is remarkable for its very visible record of high mass loss events observed over the range of wavelengths from the optical and infrared to the submillimeter region with ALMA. The SW Clump or SW knots are unique in the ejecta of VY CMa. Except for the central star, they are the brightest sources of dusty infrared emission in its complex ejecta. In this paper we combine the proper motions from the HST images, and infrared fluxes from 2 to 12 microns with the 12CO images from ALMA to determine their ages and mass estimates. The SW knots were ejected more than 200 years ago with an active period lasting about 30 years, and with a total mass in the Clump more than 0.02 Solar masses.</description>

      <title>Formation of Be star decretion discs through boundary layer effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Be stars are rapidly rotating, with angular frequency around $0.7-0.8$ of their Keplerian break up frequency, as a result of significant accretion during the earlier stellar evolution of a companion star. Material from the equator of the Be star is ejected and forms a decretion disc, although the mechanism for the disc formation has remained elusive. We find one-dimensional steady state decretion disc solutions that smoothly transition from a rapidly rotating star that is in hydrostatic balance. Boundary layer effects in a geometrically thick disc which connects to a rotationally flattened star enable the formation of a decretion disc at stellar spin rates below the break up rate. For a disc with an aspect ratio $H/R\approx 0.1$ at the inner edge, the torque from the disc on the star slows the stellar spin to the observed range and mass ejection continues at a rate consistent with observed decretion rates. The critical rotation rate, to which the star slows down to, decreases as the disc aspect ratio increases. More generally, steady state accretion and decretion disc solutions can be found for all stellar spin rates. The outcome for a particular system depends upon the balance between the decretion rate and any external infall accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Probing the Gaia atmospheric parameters of stars in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous stellar surveys have been or will provide photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data for a large number of stars in the Milky Way and neighbouring galaxies. Modern data processing tools and analysis methods are needed to deal with these data sets and obtain accurate and precise results. In this context, we are developing a new spectroscopic analysis pipeline based on the differential analysis method. The CHEmical Survey analysis System (CHESS) aims to automate the steps needed to obtain high-quality stellar parameters and abundances from large samples of spectra. To automatically identify the spectra of similar stars that are suitable for a differential analysis, CHESS first performs what we call a similarity analysis by directly using the observed spectra. This step of analysis uses unsupervised machine learning algorithms (such as dimensionality reduction methods). To validate the findings, we used atmospheric parameters from several catalogues (in particular those available in Gaia DR3). Alternatively, such a similarity analysis also serves as a consistency check of the atmospheric parameters in these catalogues. Here, we present our method for finding similar stars in globular clusters and the first preliminary results of their atmospheric parameters.</description>

      <title>The Diversity of Cold Worlds: a blended-light binary straddling the T/Y transition in brown dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first brown dwarf spectral binary characterized with JWST: WISE J014656.66+423410.0, the coldest blended-light brown dwarf binary straddling the T/Y transition. We obtained a moderate resolution (R$\sim$2700) G395H spectrum of this unresolved binary with JWST/NIRSpec and we fit it to late-T and Y dwarf spectra from JWST/NIRSpec, and model spectra of comparable temperatures, both as individual spectra and pairs mimicking an unresolved binary system. We find that this tightly-separated binary is likely composed of two unequal-brightness sources with a magnitude difference of $0.50\pm0.08$ mag in IRAC [4.5] and a secondary $1.01\pm0.13$ mag redder than the primary in [3.6]-[4.5]. Despite the large color difference between the best fit primary and secondary, their temperature difference is only $92\pm23$\,K, a feature reminiscing of the L/T transition. Carbon disequilibrium chemistry strongly shapes the mid-infrared spectra of these sources, as a complex function of metallicity and surface gravity. While a larger library of JWST/NIRSpec spectra is needed to conclusively examine the peculiarities of blended-light sources, this spectral binary is a crucial pathfinder to both understand the spectral features of planetary-mass atmospheres and detect binarity in unresolved, moderate-resolution spectra of the coldest brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Detection of the optical counterpart of the transient ULX NGC300 ULX-1: a nascent black hole - neutron star binary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The end points of massive star evolution are poorly known, especially those in interacting binary systems containing compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes. Such systems are bright in X-rays, and the most luminous among them are called ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this paper, we address the enigmatic NGC 300 ULX-1. It's X-ray activity started in 2010 with the supernova impostor-like event SN 2010da. In the following few years the ULX was powered by persistent super-Eddington accretion but then it dimmed in X-rays. We present the most recent X-ray and optical observations. The Chandra and Swift telescopes confirm that SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 is not accreting at super-Eddington level anymore. We attribute this switch in accretion regime to the donor star variability and its fast evolution. In order to gain a better understanding of the donor star's nature, we consider its optical light curve on a decade-long time scale and show that the optical counterpart of SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 dimmed significantly over recent years. The most recent detection in optical by the Gemini telescope reveals that the source is now &gt; 2.5 mag fainter in the r' band compared to the epoch when it was spectroscopically classified as a red supergiant. We discuss the nature of the abrupt changes in the donor star properties, and consider among other possibilities the silent collapse of the donor star into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Deriving Stellar Properties, Distances, and Reddenings using Photometry and Astrometry with BRUTUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present brutus, an open source Python package for quickly deriving stellar properties, distances, and reddenings to stars based on grids of stellar models constrained by photometric and astrometric data. We outline the statistical framework for deriving these quantities, its implementation, and various Galactic priors over the 3-D distribution of stars, stellar properties, and dust extinction (including $R_V$ variation). We establish a procedure to empirically calibrate MIST v1.2 isochrones by using open clusters to derive corrections to the effective temperatures and radii of the isochrones, which reduces systematic errors on the lower main sequence. We also describe and apply a method to estimate photometric offsets between stellar models and observed data using nearby, low-reddening field stars. We perform a series of tests on mock and real data to examine parameter recovery with MIST under different modeling assumptions, illustrating that brutus is able to recover distances and other stellar properties using optical to near-infrared photometry and astrometry. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/joshspeagle/brutus.</description>

      <title>A Spectroastrometric Study of the Low-velocity Wind from DG Tau A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtained high spectral resolution spectra ($\Delta v$ $\sim$ 2.5 km s$^{-1}$) for DG Tau A from 4800 \r{A} to 7500 \r{A} using Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) for the first time. The low-velocity components (LVCs, |$v$| &lt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) were observed in the [O I] 5577, 6300, 6364 \r{A}, [S II] 6716, 6731 \r{A} lines. The offset position spectra observed in the LVCs show a "negative velocity gradient", supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind associated with the LVC emission. The offset position spectra observed in a component within the LVC velocity range between -16 km s$^{-1}$ to -41 km s$^{-1}$, namely, LVC-M, show a "negative velocity gradient'', supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind. With 12-70 au wind lengths measured using spectroastrometry, we estimate a lower limit to the wind mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. In addition to the LVCs, we identify two high-velocity components (HVCs, |$v$| &gt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the collimated jet in 26 lines ([N I], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], [Ca II], [Fe II], H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, He I). The one with a clear spatial offset from the star ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC1) is associated with an internal shock surface of the jet, while the other at the base ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC2) may be a stationary shock component. We find that the observed line profiles and the spatial scales of the LVC emission do not agree with the existing predictions for photoevaporative or magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds. These could be explained by the X-wind model, but synthetic observations are required for detailed comparisons.</description>

      <title>Episodic outbursts during brown dwarf formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is evidence that stars and browns dwarfs grow through episodic rather than continuous gas accretion. However, the role of episodic accretion in the formation of brown dwarfs remains mostly unexplored. We investigate the role of episodic accretion, triggered by the magnetorotational instability in the inner disk regions, resulting in episodic outbursts during the formation of brown dwarfs, and its implications for their early formation stages. We use hydrodynamical simulations coupled with a sub-grid accretion model to investigate the formation of young proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, taking into account the effects of episodic accretion resulting in episodic radiative feedback, i.e. in luminosity outbursts. The formation timescale for proto brown dwarfs is at least one order of magnitude shorter than that of protostars. Episodic accretion leads to a shorter main accretion phase compared to continuous accretion in brown dwarfs, whereas the opposite is true for low-mass stars. Episodic accretion can accelerate early mass accretion in proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, but it results in less massive objects by the end of the main phase compared to continuous accretion. We find an approximately linear correlation between an object's mass at the end of the main accretion phase and the timing of the last episodic outburst: later events result in more massive brown dwarfs but less massive low-mass stars. Episodic outbursts have a stronger effect on brown dwarf-forming cloud cores, with the last outburst essentially splitting the brown dwarf evolution into a short high-accretion and a much longer low-accretion phase.</description>

      <title>An SS433 flare caught by TESS. Fast rise times and evidence for a 13 hours quasi-period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical inflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here I report on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54 in June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux increase by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented continuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the flux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by accretion rate ($\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star mass loss rate. We estimate $\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an increase in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same factor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary system during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the donor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a mean density $\left &lt; \rho \right &gt; \sim 18 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for the donor star, compared to $\left &lt; \rho_{\mathrm{RL}} \right &gt; = 0.7-1 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star. Another SS433 lightcurve from a Sector 80 TESS observation in 2024 hints that there may be an outflow from behind the the donor star.</description>

      <title>Radiation-magnetohydrodynamics with MPI-AMRVAC using flux-limited diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Radiation plays a significant role in solar and astrophysical environments as it may constitute a sizeable fraction of the energy density, momentum flux, and the total pressure. Modelling the dynamic interaction between radiation and magnetized plasmas in such environments is an intricate and computationally costly task. Aims. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the capabilities of the open-source parallel, block-adaptive computational framework MPI-AMRVAC, in solving equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), and to present benchmark test cases relevant for radiation-dominated magnetized plasmas. Methods. The existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and flux-limited diffusion (FLD) radiative-hydrodynamics physics modules are combined to solve the equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on block-adaptive finite volume Cartesian meshes in any dimensionality. Results. We introduce and validate several benchmark test cases such as steady radiative MHD shocks, radiation-damped linear MHD waves, radiation-modified Riemann problems and a multi-dimensional radiative magnetoconvection case. We recall the basic governing Rankine-Hugoniot relations for shocks and the dispersion relation for linear MHD waves in the presence of optically thick radiation fields where the diffusion limit is reached. The RMHD system allows for 8 linear wave types, where the classical 7-wave MHD picture (entropy and three wave pairs for slow, Alfven and fast) is augmented with a radiative diffusion mode. Conclusions. The MPI-AMRVAC code now has the capability to perform multidimensional RMHD simulations with mesh adaptation making it well-suited for larger scientific applications to study magnetized matter-radiation interactions in solar and stellar interiors and atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The properties of supermassive stars in galaxy merger driven direct collapse I: models without rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of the most massive quasars observed at high redshifts requires extreme accretion rates ($&gt;1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). Inflows of $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ are found in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers, leading to the formation of supermassive discs (SMDs) with high metallicities ($&gt;$ Z$_\odot$). Supermassive stars (SMSs) born in these SMDs could be the progenitors of the most extreme quasars. Here, we study the properties of non-rotating SMSs forming in high metallicity SMDs. Using the stellar evolution code GENEC, we compute numerically the hydrostatic structures of non-rotating SMSs with metallicities $Z=1-10$ Z$_\odot$ by following their evolution under constant accretion at rates $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We determine the final mass of the SMSs, set by the general-relativistic (GR) instability, by applying the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations to the hydrostatic structures. We find that non-rotating SMSs with metallicities $Z=1-10$ Z$_\odot$ accreting at rates $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ evolve as red supergiant protostars until their final collapse. All the models reach the GR instability during H-burning. The final mass is $\sim10^6$ M$_\odot$, nearly independently of the metallicity and the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>SPYGLASS. VI. Feedback-Driven Star Formation in the Circinus Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young associations provide a record that traces the star formation process, and the youngest populations connect progenitor gas dynamics to the resulting stellar populations. We therefore conduct the first comprehensive overview of the Circinus Complex, an under-studied and massive ($\sim$1500 M$_{\odot}$) region consisting of approximately 3100 recently formed stars alongside the Circinus Molecular Cloud (CMC). We find a clear age pattern in the contiguous central region (CirCe), where younger stars are found further from the massive central cluster, and where the velocities are consistent with uniform expansion. By comparing this structure to an analogous STARFORGE simulation, we find that the age structure and dynamics of the association are consistent with star formation in two stages: the global collapse of the parent cloud that builds the $500 M_{\odot}$ central cluster ASCC 79, followed by triggered star formation in a shell swept up after the first massive stars form. We also find that filaments with a range of distances from the central cluster can naturally produce multi-generational age sequences due to differences in feedback strength and exposure. Outlying populations show velocities consistent with formation independent from the CirCe region, but with similar enough velocities that they may be difficult to distinguish from one another later in their expansion. We therefore provide a new alternative view of sequential star formation that relies on feedback from a single central cluster rather than the multiple sequential generations that are traditionally invoked, while also providing insight into the star formation history of older populations.</description>

      <title>Global Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of transition disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Transition disks (TDs) are a type of protoplanetary disk characterized by a central dust and gas cavity. The processes behind how these cavities are formed and maintained, along with their observed high accretion rates of $10^{-8} -10^{-7} \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, continue to be subjects of active research. Aims. This work aims to investigate how the inclusion of the Hall effect (HE) alongside Ohmic resistivity (OR) and ambipolar diffusion (AD) affects the structure of the TD. Of key interest is the dynamical evolution of the cavity and whether it can indeed produce transonic accretion, as predicted by theoretical models in order to account for the observed high accretion rates despite the inner disk's low density. Methods. We present our results of 2D axisymmetric global radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of TDs for which all three non-ideal MHD effects are accounted. We used the NIRVANA-III fluid code and initialized our model with a disk cavity reaching up to $R=8~\mathrm{au}$ with a density contrast of $10^5$. We performed three runs, one with only OR and AD, and one for each of the two configurations that arise when additionally including the HE, that is, with the field aligned (anti-aligned) with respect to the rotation axis. Results. For all three runs, our models maintain an intact inner cavity and an outer standard disk. MHD winds are launched both from the cavity and from the disk. Notably, when the HE is included, ring-like structures develop within the cavity. We moreover obtain accretion rates of $3 - 8 \times 10^{-8} \, M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to typical values seen in full disks. Importantly, we clearly observe transonic accretion ($v_{\mathrm{acc}} \gtrsim c_{s}$) in the cavity. Additionally, outward magnetic flux transport occurs in all three runs.</description>

      <title>Re-recognized universality of Kozai oscillation on three-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1962, Yoshihide Kozai reported his findings on the secular dynamics of asteroids moving in orbits with high inclination and eccentricity. In contrast to the classic understanding of the stability of planetary motion in the solar system, Kozai showed that asteroids can significantly change their orbital shape over a long timescale in an oscillatory manner between nearly circular orbits and highly elliptic orbits. An anti-correlated variation between orbital inclination and eccentricity characterizes this oscillation. The importance of Kozai's work in understanding the dynamical evolution of various systems was recognized decades later, including the fields of irregular satellites of planets, Oort Cloud, extrasolar planets, binary star systems, type Ia supernovae, planet climate, merging black hole systems, and so on.</description>

      <title>NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Phase I Final Report -- A Lunar Long-Baseline UV/Optical Imaging Interferometer: Artemis-enabled Stellar Imager (AeSI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents the findings of a NIAC Phase I feasibility study for the Artemis-enabled Stellar Imager (AeSI), a proposed high-resolution, UV/Optical interferometer designed for deployment on the lunar surface. Its primary science goal is to image the surfaces and interiors of stars with unprecedented detail, revealing new details about their magnetic processes and dynamic evolution and enabling the creation of a truly predictive solar/stellar dynamo model. This capability will transform our understanding of stellar physics and has broad applicability across astrophysics, from resolving the cores of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to studying supernovae, planetary nebulae, and the late stages of stellar evolution. By leveraging the stable vacuum environment of the Moon and the infrastructure being established for the Artemis Program, AeSI presents a compelling case for a lunar-based interferometer. In this study, the AeSI Team, working with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Integrated Design Center (IDC), has firmly established the feasibility of building and operating a reconfigurable, dispersed aperture telescope (i.e., an interferometer) on the lunar surface. The collaboration produced a credible Baseline design featuring 15 primary mirrors arranged in an elliptical array with a 1 km major axis, with the potential to expand to 30 mirrors and larger array sizes through staged deployments. Additionally, this study identified numerous opportunities for optimization and the necessary trade studies to refine the design further. These will be pursued in follow-up investigations, such as a NIAC Phase II study, to advance the concept toward implementation.</description>

      <title>NICER observations of type-I X-ray bursts from the ultra-compact X-ray binary M15 X-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type-I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions caused by the unstable burning of accreted material on the surface of neutron stars. We report the detection of seven type-I X-ray bursts from the ultracompact X-ray binary M15 X-2 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its 2022 outburst. We found all the bursts occurred in the soft state and exhibited similar light curve profiles, with no cases of photospheric radius expansion. Time-resolved spectroscopy showed clear deviations from the blackbody model during the first ten seconds of all the bursts. The fits were improved by using the enhanced persistent emission method, which we interpret as evidence of burst-disk interaction. We compared the performance of these models against a neutron star atmosphere model and found it made no significant improvements. After analyzing the burst rise times and fuel composition, we propose that these bursts were powered by the burning of pure helium, confirming the ultracompact nature of the source.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Milky Way in 5-D with 170 Million Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present "augustus", a catalog of distance, extinction, and stellar parameter estimates to 170 million stars from $14\,{\rm mag} &lt; r &lt; 20\,{\rm mag}$ and with $|b| &gt; 10^\circ$ drawing on a combination of optical to near-IR photometry from Pan-STARRS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, and unWISE along with parallax measurements from \textit{Gaia} DR2 and 3-D dust extinction maps. After applying quality cuts, we find 125 million objects have "high-quality" posteriors with statistical distance uncertainties of $\lesssim 10\%$ for objects with well-constrained stellar types. This is a substantial improvement over distance estimates derived from Gaia parallaxes alone and in line with results from previous work. We find the fits are able to accurately reproduce the de-reddened Gaia color-magnitude diagram, which serves as a useful consistency check of our results. We show that we are able to clearly detect large, kinematically-coherent substructures in our data relative to the input priors, including the Monoceros Ring and the Sagittarius stream, attesting to the quality of the catalog. Our results are publicly available at doi:10.7910/DVN/WYMSXV. An accompanying interactive visualization can be found at http://allsky.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.</description>

      <title>SN 2021hpr: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Showing Excess Emission in the Early Rising Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive optical observations of a nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021hpr, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 at a distance of $\sim$ 45 Mpc. Our observations cover a phase within $\sim 1-2$ days to $\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \approx -19.16 \pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\sim 7.0 \%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\sc ii} and Ca {\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\sc ii} and Ni {\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.</description>

      <title>SpecDis: Value added distance catalogue for 4 million stars from DESI Year-1 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the SpecDis value added stellar distance catalogue accompanying DESI DR1. SpecDis trains a feed-forward Neural Network (NN) on a large sample of stars with Gaia parallaxes, but without applying selections on parallax error or signal-to-noise (S/N) of the stellar spectra. We incorporate parallax error into the loss function for training. This approach ensures the training sample not suffering from biases. Moreover, SpecDis predicts the reciprocal of the square root of luminosity, which is linearly proportional to parallax and helps to avoid excluding negative parallaxes. To enhance the precision of distance predictions, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the noise and dimensionality of stellar spectra. Validated by independent external samples of member stars with precise distances from globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and stellar streams, combined with BHB stars, we demonstrate that our distance measurements show no significant bias up to 100 kpc, and are much more precise than Gaia parallax beyond 7 kpc. The median distance uncertainties are 23 %, 19 %, 11 % and 7 % for S/N$&lt;$20, 20$\leq$S/N$&lt;$ 60, 60$\leq$ S/N $&lt;$ 100 and S/N$\geq$100. Selecting stars with $\log g&lt;3.8$ and distance uncertainties smaller than 25 %, we have more than 74,000 giant candidates within 50 kpc to the Galactic center and 1,500 candidates beyond this distance. Additionally, we develop a Gaussian mixture model to identify binaries and identify 120,000 possible binaries, and discover that the binary fraction increases with [Fe/H] and $\log g$ and declines with [$\alpha$/Fe] and $T_\mathrm{eff}$, indicating stars with low Fe and high $\alpha$, which form early, may have experienced more encounters and tidal effects to disrupt binaries. Our final catalogue provides distances and distance uncertainties for $&gt;$4 million stars, offering a valuable resource for Galactic astronomy.</description>

      <title>No Robust Statistical Evidence for a Population of Water Worlds in a 2025 Sample of Planets Orbiting M Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of exoplanets has led to many surprises, one of which is the discovery of planets larger than Earth yet smaller than Neptune, super Earths and gas dwarfs. No such planet is a member of the Solar System, yet they appear to be abundant in the local neighbourhood. Their internal structure is not well understood. Super Earths presumably are rocky planets with a thin secondary atmosphere, whereas gas dwarfs have a substantial (by volume) primary H/He atmosphere. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the presence of a third class of planets, so-called water worlds, which are hypothesised to contain a significant mass fraction of water in condensed or steam form. This study examines the evidence for water worlds and presents a sample of 60 precisely measured small exoplanets (less than 4 Earth radii) orbiting M dwarf stars. We combine observational data and unsupervised machine-learning techniques to classify these planets based on their mass, radius, and density. We individually model the interior of each planet using the ExoMDN code and classify them into populations based on these models. Our findings indicate that the sample divides into two distinct planet populations, with no clear evidence supporting the existence of water worlds in the current dataset.</description>

      <title>$^{14}$N$/^{15}$N abundance ratio toward massive star-forming regions with different Galactic distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance ratio of $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N is, in principle, a powerful tool for tracing stellar nucleosynthesis. This work aims to measure and analyze ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) and $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N abundance ratios in massive star-forming regions across a range of galactocentric distances to provide constraints on galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models. We present H$^{13}$CN and HC$^{15}$N J=2-1 results toward 51massive star-forming regions obtained with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30 meter telescope.\ We used these results to derive ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratios as well as $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratios using the double isotope method. We find an overall decreasing trend in the ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratio and an increasing trend in the $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratio with increasing galactocentric distance ($D_{\rm GC}$), which provides a good constraint for the GCE model based on high signal to noise ratio measurements. While the predicted ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) ratios between 6 and 12 kpc determined using current GCE models are consistent with our observational results, the ratios from models for $D_{\rm GC}$ less than 6 kpc are significantly higher than the observational results, which indicates GCE models for $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and/or $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C ratios need to be updated for at least this range.</description>

      <title>Photometric Calibration &amp; Spectral Validation of the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is one of the seven payloads on board Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). SUIT provides full and partial disk images of the Sun in the 200-400 nm wavelength range. This would help us probe the solar atmosphere at different heights and understand the mass and energy transfer process between its layers. For the first time, SUIT will also help us measure spatially resolved solar spectral irradiance at this wavelength band, which is significant for studying the sun-climate relationships. To perform these studies, it is necessary to photometrically calibrate the payload and validate the spectral coverage of the various bandpasses. We perform the photometric calibration and spectral validation of 8 bandpasses using light of known intensity and spectral coverage. For photometric calibration, the telescope throughput is modeled using sun-as-a-star spectrum from SOLSTICE and SOLSPEC. The modeled throughput is compared with in-lab measurements taken with light of known intensity. The ratio of measured photoelectrons gathered with the modeled prediction agree within 20%. For spectral validation, readings are taken across the transmission spectrum of each filter, keeping adjacent readings independent of each other. The relative intensity measured at each wavelength is seen to trace the modeled telescope bandpass for that filter. These tests could not be performed for filters with bandpasses operating below 250 nm (NB01, BB01 and BB02), primarily due to heavy atmospheric attenuation in these wavelengths leading to decreased SNR of the data. The experimentally measured results agree closely with the modeled values, validating SUIT's optical performance and presenting the reliability of the developed throughput model.</description>

      <title>A Deep, High-Angular Resolution 3D Dust Map of the Southern Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep, high-angular resolution 3D dust map of the southern Galactic plane over $239^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 6^\circ$ and $|b| &lt; 10^\circ$ built on photometry from the DECaPS2 survey, in combination with photometry from VVV, 2MASS, and unWISE and parallaxes from Gaia DR3 where available. To construct the map, we first infer the distance, extinction, and stellar types of over 700 million stars using the brutus stellar inference framework with a set of theoretical MIST stellar models. Our resultant 3D dust map has an angular resolution of $1'$, roughly an order of magnitude finer than existing 3D dust maps and comparable to the angular resolution of the Herschel 2D dust emission maps. We detect complexes at the range of distances associated with the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms in the fourth quadrant, as well as more distant structures out to a maximum reliable distance of $d \approx$ 10 kpc from the Sun. The map is sensitive up to a maximum extinction of roughly $A_V \approx 12$ mag. We publicly release both the stellar catalog and the 3D dust map, the latter of which can easily be queried via the Python package dustmaps. When combined with the existing Bayestar19 3D dust map of the northern sky, the DECaPS 3D dust map fills in the missing piece of the Galactic plane, enabling extinction corrections over the entire disk $|b| &lt; 10^\circ$. Our map serves as a pathfinder for the future of 3D dust mapping in the era of LSST and Roman, targeting regimes accessible with deep optical and near-infrared photometry but often inaccessible with Gaia.</description>

      <title>The hot corino-like chemistry of four FUor-like protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Compared to Class 0 protostars, the higher densities and lower temperatures of the disk midplanes of Class I young stellar objects (YSOs) limit the detectability of complex organic molecules (COMs). The elevated luminosities of eruptive YSOs increase disk temperatures sublimating frozen molecules and easing their detection.
  Aims: Our aim is to investigate the chemical composition of four FUor-like Class I YSOs: L1551 IRS 5, Haro 5a IRS, V346 Nor, and OO Ser, and to compare their abundances of COMs with other YSOs in the literature.
  Methods: We search for COMs line emission in ALMA Band 6 observations. We use the CASSIS software to determine their column densities (N) and excitation temperatures (T_ex) assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium.
  Results: We detect 249 transitions from 12 COMs. In L1551 IRS 5 we identified CH3OH, 13CH3OH, CH318OH, CH2DOH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, CH3COCH3, C2H5OH, C2H5CN, 13CH3CN, and CH3C15)N. Haro 5a IRS and OO Ser have emission from CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO. CH3COCH3 is also detected in OO Ser. In V346 Nor we found CH3OH, CH2DOH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and C2H5CN. The emission of COMs is compact in all targets. The analysis indicates their temperatures are above 100K. The abundance ratios of COMs derived for these eruptive YSOs, as well as for other protostars in the literature, span several orders of magnitude without any clear differentiation between the eruptive and quiescent YSOs. The column density of the main isotopologue of CH3OH should not be used as a reference, as most of the lines are optically thick.
  Conclusions: The hot and compact emission of COMs indicates that the four FUor-like targets are hot corino-like. Spectral studies of such objects can be useful to investigate the complex organic chemistry at later evolutionary stages than the usual Class 0 stage.</description>

      <title>Hot Subdwarf Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot subdwarf (SD) stars are the stripped cores of red giant stars in transition to the white dwarf sequence. The B-type subdwarfs (sdB) are powered by helium fusion in the core, more evolved ones (sdO) by shell burning. Low mass SDs may evolve through this stage without any support by nuclear fusion. Because the loss of the giants' envelopes is likely caused by mass transfer in binaries, hot SDs are test beds for close-binary evolution through stable and unstable Roche lobe overflow, common envelope formation and ejection as well as mergers. Many classes of hot SDs can be identified according to surface composition, binarity, magnetism, pulsation characteristics and population membership, including members of globular clusters. Observed binaries show a wide spread of orbital periods from 20 minutes to more than 1,000 days with white dwarf or main sequence companions. The closest systems qualify as type Ia supernova progenitors and LISA detectable gravitational wave sources. High-precision light curves from Kepler and TESS combined with radial velocity curves are used to derive masses, while asteroseismology adds information on the internal structure, slow rotation, and synchronization. Gaia's parallax measurements now allow us to place the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and derive stellar parameters by combining them with multi-band photometry. The stellar radius can be determined to high precision this way. Newton's law can then be used to derive masses if accurate surface gravities are available. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys will provide atmospheric parameters for large samples of stars, allowing the mass distributions for the diverse subtypes to be established. These are crucial for testing binary synthesis models and constraining poorly known parameters such as the common envelope efficiency as well as the critical threshold mass-ratio for mass transfer stability.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of SN 2023ixf reveals both circumstellar material and helium core to be aspherical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present multi-epoch optical spectropolarimetric and imaging polarimetric observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf discovered in M101 at a distance of 6.85 Mpc. The first imaging polarimetric observations were taken +2.33 days (60085.08 MJD) after the explosion, while the last imaging polarimetric data points (+73.19 and +76.19 days) were acquired after the fall from the light curve plateau. At +2.33 days there is strong evidence of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction in the spectra and the light curve. A significant level of intrinsic polarization $p_r = 1.02\pm 0.07 \% $ is seen during this phase which indicates that this CSM is aspherical. We find that the polarization evolves with time toward the interstellar polarization level during the photospheric phase, which suggests that the recombination photosphere is spherically symmetric. There is a jump in polarization ($p_r =0.45 \pm 0.08 \% $ and $p_r =0.62 \pm 0.08 \% $) at +73.19 and +76.19 days when the light curve falls from the plateau. This is a phase where polarimetric data is sensitive to non-spherical inner ejecta or a decrease in optical depth into the single scattering regime. We also present spectropolarimetric data that reveal line (de)polarization during most of the observed epochs. In addition, at +14.50 days we see an ``inverse P Cygni" profile in the H and He line polarization, which clearly indicates the presence of asymmetrically distributed material overlying the photosphere. The overall temporal evolution of polarization is typical for Type II SNe, but the high level of polarization during the rising phase has only been observed in SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>The birth mass function of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The birth mass function of neutron stars encodes rich information about supernova explosions, double star evolution, and properties of matter under extreme conditions. To date, it has remained poorly constrained by observations, however. Applying probabilistic corrections to account for mass accreted by recycled pulsars in binary systems to mass measurements of 90 neutron stars, we find that the birth masses of neutron stars can be described by a unimodal distribution that smoothly turns on at $1.1 M_{\odot}$, peaks at $1.27 M_{\odot}$, before declining as a steep power law. Such a ``turn-on" power-law distribution is strongly favoured against the widely-adopted empirical double-Gaussian model at the $3 \sigma$ level. The power-law shape may be inherited from the initial mass function of massive stars, but the relative dearth of massive neutron stars implies that single stars with initial masses greater than $\approx 18 M_{\odot}$ do not form neutron stars, in agreement with the absence of massive red supergiant progenitors to supernovae.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models with phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. We show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as ~10^51 erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Our results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, we predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. We find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.</description>
