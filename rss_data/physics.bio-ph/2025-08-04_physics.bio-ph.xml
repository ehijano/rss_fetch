      <title>Rapid Single-Cell Measurement of Transient Transmembrane Water Flow under Osmotic Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While aquaporin (AQP) gating dynamically regulates transmembrane water permeability for cellular homeostasis, its mechanisms remain poorly understood compared to ion channels. A central challenge is the lack of methods to measure water flow through AQPs with the spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity equivalent to patch-clamp recordings of ion fluxes, a limitation stemming from the electrically silent nature of water transport. We introduce a technique to rapidly detect cytoplasmic flows induced by osmotic-gradient-driven transmembrane water transport in single adherent human cancer cells. This approach enables direct measurement of AQP-mediated water transport and provides a powerful tool to investigate AQP function and regulation and cytoplasmic flow dynamics at the single-cell level.</description>

      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>

      <title>Designing cultured tissue moulds using evolutionary strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an unmet need for artificial intelligence techniques that can speed up the design of growth strategies for cultured tissues. Cultured tissue is increasingly important for a range of applications such as cultivated meat, pharmaceutical assays and regenerative medicine. In this paper, we introduce a method based around evolutionary strategies, machine learning and biophysical simulations that can be used to speed up the process of identifying new tissue growth strategies for these diverse applications. We demonstrate the method by designing tethering strategies to grow tissues containing various cell types with desirable properties such as high cellular alignment and uniform density.</description>

      <title>Multivalent linkers mediated ultra-sensitive bio-detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In biosensing and diagnostic applications, a key objective is to design detection systems capable of identifying targets at very low concentrations, i.e., achieving high sensitivity. Here, we propose a linker-mediated detection scheme in which the presence of target molecules (linkers) facilitates the adsorption of ligand-coated guest nanoparticles onto a receptor-coated host substrate. Through a combination of computer simulations and mean-field theory, we demonstrate that, at fixed overall binding strength, increasing the valency of linkers exponentially lowers the concentration threshold for detection. This enables the identification of targets at extremely low concentrations, which is critical for early-stage disease and pathogen diagnostics. Furthermore, superselectivity with respect to binding strength is preserved for multivalent linkers, allowing for effective discrimination between targets and non-targets. Our findings highlight multivalency engineering of linkers as a powerful strategy to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of biodetection systems.</description>

      <title>Design, Simulation, and Fabrication of a Hexagonal Microfluidic Platform for Culturing Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an organoid computing platform from neurons in vitro demands stable, precisely controlled microenvironments. To address this requirement, we designed, simulated, and fabricated a microfluidic device featuring hexagonal wells ($34.64\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ side length) in a honeycomb array connected by $20\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ channels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, validated by high mesh quality ($0.934$ orthogonal quality) and robust convergence, confirmed the architecture supports flow regimes ideal for ensuring cell viability. At target flow rates of $0.1$ - $1\,\mathrm{\mu L/min}$, simulations revealed the extrapolated pressure differential across the full $50{,}000\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ device remains within stable operating limits at $177\,\mathrm{kPa}$ (average) and $329\,\mathrm{kPa}$ (maximum). Photolithography successfully produced this architecture, with only minor corner rounding observed at feature interfaces. This work therefore establishes a computationally validated and fabricated platform, paving the way for experimental flow characterization and subsequent neural integration.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary learning of microbial populations in partially predictable environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Populations evolving in fluctuating environments face the fundamental challenge of balancing adaptation to current conditions against preparation for uncertain futures. Here, we study microbial evolution in partially predictable environments using proteome allocation models that capture the trade-off between growth rate and lag time during environmental transitions. We demonstrate that evolution drives populations toward an evolutionary stable allocation strategy that minimizes resource depletion time, thereby balancing faster growth with shorter adaptation delays. In environments with temporal structure, populations evolve to learn the statistical patterns of environmental transitions through proteome pre-allocation, with the evolved allocations reflecting the transition probabilities between conditions. Our framework reveals how microbial populations can extract and exploit environmental predictability without explicit neural computation, using the proteome as a distributed memory system that encodes environmental patterns. This work demonstrates how information-theoretic principles govern cellular resource allocation and provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding learning-like behavior in evolving biological systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse 3D Microscopy Rendering for Cell Shape Inference with Active Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional methods for biological shape inference, such as deep learning (DL) and active contour models, face important limitations in 3D. DL approaches require large annotated datasets, which are often impractical to obtain, while active contour methods depend on carefully tuned heuristics for intensity attraction and shape regularization. We introduce deltaMic, a novel differentiable 3D renderer for fluorescence microscopy that formulates shape inference as an inverse problem. By leveraging differentiable convolutions, deltaMic simulates the image formation process, integrating a parameterized point spread function (PSF) with a triangle mesh-based representation of biological structures. Unlike DL- or contour-based segmentation, deltaMic directly optimizes both shape and optical parameters to align synthetic and real microscopy images, removing the need for large datasets or sample-specific fine-tuning. To ensure scalability, we implement a GPU-accelerated Fourier transform for triangle meshes along with narrow-band spectral filtering. We show that deltaMic accurately reconstructs cell geometries from both synthetic and diverse experimental 3D microscopy data, while remaining robust to noise and initialization. This establishes a new physics-informed framework for biophysical image analysis and inverse modeling.</description>

      <title>Potential Global Sequestration of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide by Drylands Forestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drylands forestation offers the potential for significant long-term sequestration of atmospheric CO$_2$. Consider sequestration of both organic and inorganic carbon by a planted semi-arid forest, based on carbon that originates from atmospheric CO$_2$. Measurements at Israel's Yatir forest give a sequestration rate of $\sim$550 gram CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ as organic carbon in the tree's biomass. In addition, $\sim$216 gram CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ precipitates as calcite (CaCO$_3$) in the soil due to a combination of microbial activity on organic soil carbon, and the reaction of soil water with CO$_2$ exhaled from tree roots. The exhaled CO$_2$ is formed when glucose (produced by photosynthesis) is oxidized to supply energy for the trees' cellular processes. Significantly, low rainfall in drylands precludes dissolving precipitated calcite. Published estimates restrict the potential drylands surface available for sustainable forestation to $\sim$4.5 million km$^2$, only $\sim$10$\%$ of the global drylands. The dominant limitation is the apparent lack of water. However, immediately under many drylands, there are fossil waters that had recharged underlying aquifers during prior wetter climatic regimes. Conservatively, including this water, at least 9.0 million km$^2$ is available for afforestation. Such an area may yield a potential total annual sequestration rate of $\sim$7.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$, divided between $\sim$5.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ (organic) and $\sim$2.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ (inorganic); a respectable $\sim$35$\%$ of the annual rate of atmospheric CO$_2$ increase. However, considering the reduction in land surface albedo (reflectivity), the effective cooling would be $\sim$5.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$. Drylands reforestation would provide additional area for sequestration.</description>
