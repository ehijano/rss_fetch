      <title>Concerning FAT Colorings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $C$ be a color set of cardinality $k$. Suppose $c \colon V(G) \to C$ is a (not necessarily proper) vertex coloring whose all color classes are $V_1$, $V_2$, $\dots$, $V_k$, each of which is nonempty. The vertex coloring $c$ is said to be a {\it FAT $k$-coloring of $G$} if there exist real numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$, both in $[0,1]$, such that for every vertex $v\in V(G)$ and every color class $V_i$ the following equalities hold: $$ \bigl| V_i \cap N(v) \bigr| = \begin{cases}
  \alpha \deg (v) &amp; \mbox{ if } \ \ v \notin V_i
  \beta \deg (v) &amp; \mbox{ if } \ \ v \in V_i . \end{cases} $$ Let $k &gt; 1$ be a fixed integer, and let $\alpha \in \left[ 0 , \frac{1}{k-1} \right) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ and $\beta \in [ 0 , 1 ] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ be some fixed rational numbers satisfying $ \beta + (k-1) \alpha = 1 $. It was asked for the existence of a graph $G$ with $\delta (G) &gt; 0$ admitting some FAT $k$-coloring with the corresponding parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This paper settles the question in the affirmative. We explicitly construct a sequence $\displaystyle\left\{G_n\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of pairwise non-homomorphically equivalent graphs, each being a regular graph of positive degree, admitting a FAT $k$-coloring with the corresponding parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.</description>

      <title>New Sidorenko-type inequalities in tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a directed analog of Sidorenko's conjecture in extremal graph theory, Fox, Himwich, Zhou, and the second author defined an oriented graph $H$ to be tournament Sidorenko (anti-Sidorenko) if the random tournament asymptotically minimizes (maximizes) the number of copies of $H$ among all tournaments. We prove new inequalities of this form for oriented trees and cycles, considering both local and global notions of the Sidorenko property.
  We make progress on a conjecture of the aforementioned authors that every tree has an anti-Sidorenko direction, and give a characterization of short paths. For long paths we show that orientations are split symmetrically between being locally Sidorenko and anti-Sidorenko, yet almost all orientations are not globally Sidorenko. Finally, we give algorithms characterizing the local Sidorenko status of paths and cycles when the number of vertices is not divisible by four.</description>

      <title>The Linear Arboricity Conjecture for Graphs with Large Girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Linear Arboricity Conjecture asserts that the linear arboricity of a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $\lceil (\Delta+1)/2 \rceil$. For a $2k$-regular graph $G$, this implies $la(G) = k+1$. In this note, we utilize a network flow construction to establish upper bounds on $la(G)$ conditioned on the girth $g(G)$. We prove that if $g(G) \ge 2k$, the conjecture holds true, i.e., $la(G) \le k+1$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for graphs with girth $g(G)$ at least $k$, $k/2$, $k/4$ and $2k/c$ for any integer constant $c$, the linear arboricity $la(G)$ satisfies the upper bounds $k+2$, $k+3$, $k+5$ and $k+\left\lceil \frac{3c+2}{2}\right\rceil$, respectively. Our approach relies on decomposing the graph into $k$ edge-disjoint 2-factors and constructing an auxiliary flow network with lower bound constraints to identify a sparse transversal subgraph that intersects every cycle in the decomposition.</description>

      <title>The Forbidden Cross Intersection Problem for Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following, for a universal constant $c&gt;0$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $1 \leq t&lt;c\frac{n}{\log n}$. Let $F,G \subset S_n$ be families of permutations such that no $\sigma \in F$ and $\tau \in G$ agree on exactly $t-1$ values. Then $|F||G| \leq ((n-t)!)^2$, with equality if and only if $F=G=\{\sigma \in S_n:\sigma(i_1)=j_1,\ldots,\sigma(i_t)=j_t\}$, for some $i_1,\ldots,i_t,j_1,\ldots,j_t \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$.
  The range of values of $t$ in the result is essentially optimal, as for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, the statement fails for $t=(1+\epsilon)\frac{n}{\log_2 n}$ and all $n&gt;n_0(\epsilon)$. This solves the cross-intersection variant of the Erd\H{o}s-S\'{o}s forbidden intersection problem for permutations. The best previously known result, by Kupavskii and Zakharov (Adv.~Math., 2024), obtained the same assertion for $t \leq \tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$. We obtain our result by combining two recently introduced techniques: hypercontractivity of global functions and spreadness.</description>

      <title>Planar networks and total positivity of Riordan arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015, Chen, Liang and Wang provided several sufficient conditions for the total positivity of Riordan arrays and asked for combinatorial proofs of these results. In this paper, we present such proofs by constructing suitable planar networks with non-negative weights and applying the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot lemma. Moreover, we slightly generalize one of the results and give more totally positive Riordan arrays.</description>

      <title>On restrained coalitions in graphs: bounds and exact values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $D \subseteq V$ is a dominating set of a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ if every vertex $v \in V \setminus D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. Two subsets of $V$ form a coalition if neither of them is a dominating set, but their union is a dominating set. A coalition partition of $G$ is its vertex partition $\pi$ such that every non-dominating set of $\pi$ is a member of some coalition, and every dominating set is a single-vertex set in $\pi$. The coalition number $C(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum cardinality of its coalition partitions. A subset $R \subseteq V$ is a restrained dominating set if $R$ is a dominating set and any vertex of $V \setminus R$ has at least one neighbor in $V \setminus R$. Restrained dominating coalition, restrained dominating partition and restrained coalition number $RC(G)$ are defined by the same way. In this paper, we prove that $RC(G) \le C(G)$ for an arbitrary graph $G$. In addition, the restrained coalition numbers of cycles and trees are determined.</description>

      <title>On the complex zeros and the computational complexity of approximating the reliability polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we relate the location of the complex zeros of the reliability polynomial to parameters at which a certain family of rational functions derived from the reliability polynomial exhibits chaotic behaviour. We use this connection to prove new results about the location of reliability zeros. In particular we show that there are zeros with modulus larger than $1$ with essentially any possible argument. We moreover use this connection to show that approximately evaluating the reliability polynomial for planar graphs at a non-positive algebraic number in the unit disk is #P-hard.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity of optimal 2-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Tutte shows that every 4-connected planar graph is Hamiltonian. In recent years, there has been growing interest in extending classical Hamiltonian results from planar graphs to sparse graphs with drawings allowing crossings, such as $k$-planar graphs, where each edge is crossed at most $k$ times. For example, using different approaches, Hud\'ak, Tom\'a\v{s} and Suzuki, as well as Noguchi and Suzuki, independently proved that every optimal 1-planar graph is Hamiltonian. Here, an optimal 1-planar graph refers to one that attains the maximum possible number of edges. In this paper, we establish results on the Hamiltonicity of optimal 2-planar graphs, that is, 2-planar graphs with the maximum number of edges. More precisely, we show that every 4-connected optimal 2-planar graph is Hamiltonian-connected. With vertex-connectivity 3, there exist infinitely many optimal 2-planar graphs that are non-Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Classification of borderenergetic chemical graphs and borderenergetic graphs of order 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy $E(G)$ of a simple graph $G$ is the sum of absolute values of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. A borderenergetic graph of order $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is any noncomplete graph~$G$ such that $E(G) = E(K_n) = 2n - 2$. Here we combine two-phase computer-assisted search with theoretical arguments to show that there are only three borderenergetic chemical graphs, thus completing the earlier findings of Li, Wei and Zhu [MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 77 (2017), 25-36]. We perform two-phase computer-assisted search to also find all $566$ borderenergetic graphs of order~$12$, thereby correcting and extending the results from a previous search performed by Furtula and Gutman [Iranian J. Math. Chem. 8(4) (2017), 339-344].</description>

      <title>Tiling with Boundaries: Dense digital images have large connected components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If most of the pixels in an $n \times m$ digital image are the same color, must the image contain a large connected component? How densely can a given set of connected components pack in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ without touching? We answer these two closely related questions for both 4-connected and 8-connected components. In particular, we use structural arguments to upper bound the "white" pixel density of infinite images whose white (4- or 8-)connected components have size at most $k$. Explicit tilings show that these bounds are tight for at least half of all natural numbers $k$ in the 4-connected case, and for all $k$ in the 8-connected case. We also extend these results to finite images.
  To obtain the upper bounds, we define the exterior site perimeter of a connected component and then leverage geometric and topological properties of this set to partition images into nontrivial regions called polygonal tiles. Each polygonal tile contains a single white connected component and satisfies a certain maximality property. We then use isoperimetric inequalities to precisely bound the area of these tiles. The solutions to these problems represent new statistics on the connected component distribution of digital images.</description>

      <title>Fourier Sparsity of Delta Functions and Matching Vector PIRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a basic and natural question about Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, which has applications to the study of Matching Vector based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes. For integers m and r, define a delta function on {0,1}^r to be a function f: Z_m^r -&gt; C with f(0) = 1 and f(x) = 0 for all nonzero Boolean x. The basic question we study is how small the Fourier sparsity of a delta function can be; namely how sparse such an f can be in the Fourier basis?
  In addition to being intrinsically interesting and natural, such questions arise naturally when studying "S-decoding polynomials" for the known matching vector families. Finding S-decoding polynomials of reduced sparsity, which corresponds to finding delta functions with low Fourier sparsity, would improve the current best PIR schemes.
  We show nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the Fourier sparsity of delta functions. Our proofs are elementary and clean. These results imply limitations on improving Matching Vector PIR schemes simply by finding better S-decoding polynomials. In particular, there are no S-decoding polynomials that can make Matching Vector PIRs based on the known matching vector families achieve polylogarithmic communication with a constant number of servers. Many interesting questions remain open.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for the Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite subset of an abelian group $G$, and suppose that $|A+A|\leq K|A|$. We show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C_\epsilon$ such that $A$ can be covered by at most $\exp(C_\epsilon \log(2K)^{1+\epsilon})$ translates of a convex coset progression with dimension at most $C_\epsilon \log(2K)^{1+\epsilon}$ and size at most $\exp(C_\epsilon \log(2K)^{1+\epsilon})|A|$. This falls just short of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture, which asserts that this statement is true for $\epsilon=0$, and improves on results of Sanders and Konyagin, who showed that this statement is true for all $\epsilon&gt;2$. To prove this result, we use a mixture of entropy methods and Fourier analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polynomials $f_{i,j}$ are introduced by Abe-Harada-Horiguchi-Masuda to produce an explicit presentation by generators and relations of the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties. In this paper we quantize the polynomials $f_{i,j}$ by a method of Fomin-Gelfand-Postnikov. Our main result states that their quantizations $F_{i,j}$ are related to the coordinate rings of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. This result yields a connection between the coordinate rings of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties and the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties. We also provide the quantized recursive formula for $F_{i,j}$.</description>

      <title>Variants of Wythoff game with terminal positions or blocking maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the software Walnut can be used to obtain concise proofs of results concerning variants of the famous Wythoff game, in which blocking maneuvers or terminal positions are added, as discussed respectively by Larsson (2011) and Komak et al. (2025). Our approach provides automatic proofs that both confirm and extend their results, and the same techniques apply to newly introduced variants as well.
  Then, using classic techniques, we obtain new recursive and morphic characterizations of Wythoff-type games where the set of terminal positions $(x,y)$ satisfy $x+y\le\ell$.
  The use of Walnut in combinatorial game theory is relatively recent, and only a few examples have been explored so far. The Wythoff game, being directly connected to the Fibonacci numeration system, proves especially well-suited to this kind of approach. It permits us to solve instances for a fixed value of a parameter.</description>

      <title>The parameterized complexity of Strong Conflict-Free Vertex-Connection Colorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of a new variant of graph coloring with a connectivity constraint recently introduced by Hsieh et al. [COCOON 2024]. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if it admits a (proper) vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices are connected by a conflict-free shortest path. Among others, we show that deciding, for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $k$-colorable is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number. But under the standard complexity-theoretic assumption NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly, deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $3$-colorable does not admit a polynomial kernel, even for bipartite graphs. This kernel lower bound is in stark contrast to the ordinal $k$-Coloring problem which is known to admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number.</description>

      <title>On strongly Koszul algebras and tidy Gr\"obner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly Koszul algebras were introduced by Herzog, Hibi and Restuccia in 2000. The goal of the present paper is to provide an in-depth study of such algebras and to investigate how strong Koszulness interacts with the existence of a quadratic Gr\"obner basis for the defining ideal. Firstly, we prove that the existence of a quadratic revlex-universal Gr\"obner basis with a strong sparsity condition (that we name "tidiness") is a sufficient condition for strong Koszulness, and exhibit several concrete examples arising from determinantal objects and Macaulay's inverse system. We then prove that there exist standard graded algebras that are strongly Koszul but do not admit a Gr\"obner basis of quadrics even after a linear change of coordinates, thus answering negatively a question posed by Conca, De Negri and Rossi. As a bonus, we prove that strong Koszulness behaves well under tensor and fiber products of algebras and illustrate how Severi varieties and Macaulay's inverse system interact to produce examples of strongly Koszul algebras with a geometric flavor.</description>

      <title>Characteristic quasi-polynomials of deletions of Shi arrangements of type B and their period collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characteristic quasi-polynomials are the enumerative functions counting the number of elements in the complement of hyperplane arrangements modulo positive integers.In this paper, we compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials of the restriction of the Shi arrangement of type B by one given hyperplane. As a corollary, we determine whether period collapse occurs in the characteristic quasi-polynomial of the deletion of the Shi arrangement of type B. This implies the solution for the conjecture posed by Higashitani, Tran and Yoshinaga in the case of the Shi arrangement of type B.</description>

      <title>Quasi-tree-partitions of graphs with an excluded subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the structure of graphs with given tree-width and excluding a fixed complete bipartite subgraph, which generalises the bounded degree setting. We give a new structural description of such graphs in terms of so-called quasi-tree-partitions. We demonstrate the utility of this result through applications to (fractional) clustered colouring. Further generalisations of these structural and colouring results are presented.</description>

      <title>A Note on Reconfiguration Graphs of Cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a reconfiguration setting, each clique of a graph $G$ is viewed as a set of tokens placed on vertices of $G$ such that no vertex has more than one token and any two tokens are adjacent. Three well-known reconfiguration rules have been studied in the literature: Token Jumping ($\mathsf{TJ}$), Token Sliding ($\mathsf{TS}$), and Token Addition/Removal ($\mathsf{TAR}$). Given a graph $G$ and a reconfiguration rule $\mathsf{R} \in \{\mathsf{TS}, \mathsf{TJ}, \mathsf{TAR}\}$, a reconfiguration graph of $k$-cliques of $G$, denoted by $\mathsf{R}_k(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are cliques of $G$ of size $k$ and two vertices are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by applying $\mathsf{R}$ exactly once. In this paper, we initiate the study of structural properties of reconfiguration graphs of cliques, proving several interesting results primarily under $\mathsf{TS}$ and $\mathsf{TJ}$ rules. In particular, we establish a formula relating the clique number of $G$ and that of $\mathsf{TS}_k(G)$, and bound the chromatic number of $\mathsf{TS}_k(G)$ via that of an appropriate Johnson graph. Additionally, we present an algorithm to construct $\mathsf{TS}_{\omega(G)-1}(G)$ from $\mathsf{TJ}_{\omega(G)}(G)$ and derive structural properties of $\mathsf{TJ}_{\omega(G)}(G)$ graphs, where $\omega(G)$ denotes the clique number of $G$. Finally, we show that $\mathsf{TS}_k(G)$ is planar whenever $G$ is planar and establish bounds on the number of $3$- and $4$-cliques based on results concerning $\mathsf{TS}_k(G)$ graphs. In particular, we prove that any planar graph $G$ with $n$ vertices can contain at most $3n - 8$ triangles, which aligns with the classical bound on maximal planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Toughness in regular graphs from eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\it toughness} $\tau(G)=\mathrm{min}\{\frac{|S|}{c(G-S)}: S~\mbox{is a vertex cut in}~G\}$ for $G\ncong K_n,$ which was initially proposed by Chv\'{a}tal in 1973. A graph $G$ is called {\it $t$-tough} if $\tau(G)\geq t.$ Let $\lambda_i(G)$ be the $i$-th largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$. In 1996, Brouwer conjectured that $\tau(G)\geq\frac{d}{\lambda}-1$ for a connected $d$-regular graph $G,$ where $\lambda=\mathrm{max}\{|\lambda_2|, |\lambda_n|\}.$ Gu [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 35 (2021) 948-952] completely confirmed this conjecture. From Brouwer and Gu's result $\tau(G)\geq\frac{d}{\lambda}-1,$ we know that if $G$ is a connected $d$-regular graph and $\lambda\leq\frac{bd}{b+1}$, then $\tau(G)\geq\frac{1}{b}$ for an integer $b\geq1.$ Inspired by the above result and utilizing typical spectral techniques and graph construction methods from Cioab\u{a} et al. [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 99 (2009) 287-297], we prove that if $G$ is a connected $d$-regular graph and $\lambda_2(G)&lt;\phi(d,b)$, then $\tau(G)\geq\frac{1}{b}$. Meanwhile, we construct graphs implying that the upper bound on $\lambda_2(G)$ is best possible. Our theorem strengthens the result of Chen et al. [Discrete Math. 348 (2025) 114404]. Finally, we also prove an upper bound of $\lambda_{b+1}(G)$ to guarantee a connected $d$-regular graph to be $\frac{1}{b}$-tough.</description>

      <title>Minimal simplicial spherical mappings with a given degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the minimal number of vertices $\lambda(n,d)$ required in a triangulation of the $n$-sphere to admit a simplicial map to the boundary of a $(n+1)$-simplex with a given degree $d$. We establish upper bounds for $\lambda(n,d)$ in dimensions $n \geq 3$. Furthermore, we provide exact formulas for small values of $d$, showing that $\lambda(n,d)=n+d+3$ for $n \geq 3$ and $d=2,3,4$. A key technical result is the identity $\lambda(n,d) = \lambda(d-1,d) + n - d + 1$ for $n \geq d$, which allows us to reduce higher-dimensional cases to lower-dimensional ones. The proofs involve constructive methods based on local modifications of triangulations and combinatorial arguments.</description>

      <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture in normed planes and an alpha-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Honeycomb Conjecture states that among tilings with unit area cells in the Euclidean plane, the average perimeter of a cell is minimal for a regular hexagonal tiling. This conjecture was proved by L. Fejes T\'oth for convex tilings, and by Hales for not necessarily convex tilings. In this paper we investigate the same question for tilings of a given normed plane, and show that among normal, convex tilings in a normed plane, the average squared perimeter of a cell is minimal for a tiling whose cells are translates of a centrally symmetric hexagon. We also show that the question whether the same statement is true for the average perimeter of a cell is closely related to an $\alpha$-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker on the area of polygons circumscribed about a convex disk. Exploring this connection we find families of norms in which the average perimeter of a cell of a tiling is minimal for a hexagonal tiling, and prove some additonal related results. Finally, we apply our method to give a partial answer to a problem of Steinhaus about the isoperimetric ratios of cells of certain tilings in the Euclidean plane, appeared in an open problem book of Croft, Falconer and Guy.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Halin's end-degree Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11841v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new instances of Halin's end degree conjecture (HC) in ZFC. In particular, we show that there is a proper class of cardinals kappa for which Halin's conjecture holds, answering two questions posed by Geschke, Kurkofka, Melcher, and Pitz (2023). We also investigate the relationship between HC and the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis, deriving consistency strength from failures of the former. Moreover, we verify that Halin's conjecture fails on finite intervals of successors of singular cardinals in Merimovich's model, yielding a new independence result concerning HC.</description>

      <title>On the hull-variation problem of equivalent vector rank metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intersection of a linear code with its dual is called the hull of the code. It is known that, for classical linear codes under the Hamming-metric, the dimension of the hull can be reduced up to equivalence. This phenomenon leads to the so-called hull-variation problem formulated by Hao Chen in 2023. In this paper, we consider the analogous problem for vector rank-metric codes, along with their associated matrix codes and extended block codes. Our results include the fact that every vector rank-metric code over any finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, in particular when $q=2$ or $q=3$, is equivalent to an LCD code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $C^1$-regular surfaces in $R^3$ that admit tilings by a finite number of rigid motion congruence classes of tiles. We construct examples with various topologies and present a framework for a systematic study, mainly concentrating on monotilings. A finite edge prototile is a tile that has only a finite number of possible interfaces with adjacent copies of itself. We describe all monotilings by such tiles with three or less edges. We consider the question of whether a monohedral polyhedron can be smoothed to become a finite edge type tileable surface with the same graph structure, and we give an example where this is not possible. Finally we list some open problems.</description>
