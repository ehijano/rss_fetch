      <title>Balance with Memory in Signed Networks via Mittag-Leffler Matrix Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural balance is an important characteristic of graphs/networks where edges can be positive or negative, with direct impact on the study of real-world complex systems. When a network is not structurally balanced, it is important to know how much balance still exists in it. Although several measures have been proposed to characterize the degree of balance, the use of matrix functions of the signed adjacency matrix emerges as a very promising area of research. Here, we take a step forward to using Mittag-Leffler (ML) matrix functions to quantify the notion of balance of signed networks. We show that the ML balance index can be obtained from first principles on the basis of a nonconservative diffusion dynamic, and that it accounts for the memory of the system about the past, by diminishing the penalization that long cycles typically receive in other matrix functions. Finally, we demonstrate the important information in the ML balance index with both artificial signed networks and real-world networks in various contexts, ranging from biological and ecological to social ones.</description>

      <title>Hankel operators with band spectra and elliptic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the class of bounded self-adjoint Hankel operators $\mathbf H$, realised as integral operators on the positive semi-axis, that commute with dilations by a fixed factor. By analogy with the spectral theory of periodic Schr\"{o}dinger operators, we develop a Floquet-Bloch decomposition for this class of Hankel operators $\mathbf H$, which represents $\mathbf H$ as a direct integral of certain compact fiber operators. As a consequence, $\mathbf H$ has a band spectrum. We establish main properties of the corresponding band functions, i.e. the eigenvalues of the fiber operators in the Floquet-Bloch decomposition. A striking feature of this model is that one may have flat bands that co-exist with non-flat bands; we consider some simple explicit examples of this nature. Furthermore, we prove that the analytic continuation of the secular determinant for the fiber operator is an elliptic function; this link to elliptic functions is our main tool.</description>

      <title>The magnitude and spectral geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's notion of magnitude for a smooth manifold with boundary of arbitrary dimension, motivated by open questions for the unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For a large class of distance functions, including embedded submanifolds of Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds satisfying a technical condition, we show that the magnitude function is well defined for $R\gg 0$ and admits a meromorphic continuation to sectors in $\mathbb{C}$. In the semiclassical limit $R \to \infty$, the magnitude function admits an asymptotic expansion, which determines the volume, surface area and integrals of generalized curvatures. Lower-order terms are computed by black box computer algebra. We initiate the study of magnitude analogues to classical questions in spectral geometry and prove an asymptotic variant of the Leinster-Willerton conjecture.</description>
