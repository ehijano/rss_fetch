      <title>Robust Reward Placement under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward placement is a common optimization problem in network diffusion processes, where a number of rewards are to be placed in a network so as to maximize the total reward obtained as agents move randomly in it. In many settings, the precise mobility network might be one of several possible, based on parameters outside our control, such as the weather conditions affecting peoples' transportation means. Solutions to the reward placement problem must thus be robust to this uncertainty, by achieving a high utility in all possible networks. To study such scenarios, we introduce the Robust Reward Placement problem (RRP). Agents move randomly on a Markovian Mobility Model that has a predetermined set of locations but its precise connectivity is unknown and chosen adversarialy from a known set $\Pi$ of candidates. Network optimization is achieved by selecting a set of reward states, and the goal is to maximize the minimum, among all candidates, ratio of rewards obtained over the optimal solution for each candidate. We first prove that RRP is NP-hard and inapproximable in general. We then develop $\Psi$-Saturate, a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm that achieves an $\epsilon$-additive approximation by exceeding the budget constraint by a factor that scales as $O(ln|\Pi|/\epsilon)$. In addition, we present several heuristics, most prominently one inspired from a dynamic programming algorithm for the max-min 0-1 Knapsack problem. We corroborate our theoretical findings with an experimental evaluation of the methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Holonic Architecture with Natural Language Processing for System of Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity and dynamic nature of System of Systems (SoS) necessitate efficient communication mechanisms to ensure interoperability and collaborative functioning among constituent systems, termed holons. This paper proposes an innovative approach to enhance holon communication within SoS through the integration of Conversational Generative Intelligence (CGI) techniques. Our approach leverages advancements in CGI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to enable holons to understand and act on natural language instructions. This fosters more intuitive human-holon interactions, improving social intelligence and ultimately leading to better coordination among diverse systems. This position paper outlines a conceptual framework for CGI-enhanced holon interaction, discusses the potential impact on SoS adaptability, usability and efficiency, and sets the stage for future exploration and prototype implementation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Deep Factor Graph for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel value decomposition algorithm, termed \textit{Dynamic Deep Factor Graphs} (DDFG). Unlike traditional coordination graphs, DDFG leverages factor graphs to articulate the decomposition of value functions, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability to complex value function structures. Central to DDFG is a graph structure generation policy that innovatively generates factor graph structures on-the-fly, effectively addressing the dynamic collaboration requirements among agents. DDFG strikes an optimal balance between the computational overhead associated with aggregating value functions and the performance degradation inherent in their complete decomposition. Through the application of the max-sum algorithm, DDFG efficiently identifies optimal policies. We empirically validate DDFG's efficacy in complex scenarios, including higher-order predator-prey tasks and the StarCraft II Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC), thus underscoring its capability to surmount the limitations faced by existing value decomposition algorithms. DDFG emerges as a robust solution for MARL challenges that demand nuanced understanding and facilitation of dynamic agent collaboration. The implementation of DDFG is made publicly accessible, with the source code available at \url{https://github.com/SICC-Group/DDFG}.</description>

      <title>Selecting the Most Conflicting Pair of Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study committee elections from a perspective of finding the most conflicting candidates, that is, candidates that imply the largest amount of conflict, as per voter preferences. By proposing basic axioms to capture this objective, we show that none of the prominent multiwinner voting rules meet them. Consequently, we design committee voting rules compliant with our desiderata, introducing conflictual voting rules. A subsequent deepened analysis sheds more light on how they operate. Our investigation identifies various aspects of conflict, for which we come up with relevant axioms and quantitative measures, which may be of independent interest. We support our theoretical study with experiments on both real-life and synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Federated Combinatorial Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a federated learning framework tailored for online combinatorial optimization with bandit feedback. In this setting, agents select subsets of arms, observe noisy rewards for these subsets without accessing individual arm information, and can cooperate and share information at specific intervals. Our framework transforms any offline resilient single-agent $(\alpha-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, having a complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\psi}{\epsilon^\beta})$, where the logarithm is omitted, for some function $\psi$ and constant $\beta$, into an online multi-agent algorithm with $m$ communicating agents and an $\alpha$-regret of no more than $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m^{-\frac{1}{3+\beta}} \psi^\frac{1}{3+\beta} T^\frac{2+\beta}{3+\beta})$. This approach not only eliminates the $\epsilon$ approximation error but also ensures sublinear growth with respect to the time horizon $T$ and demonstrates a linear speedup with an increasing number of communicating agents. Additionally, the algorithm is notably communication-efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of communication rounds, quantified as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\psi T^\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)$. Furthermore, the framework has been successfully applied to online stochastic submodular maximization using various offline algorithms, yielding the first results for both single-agent and multi-agent settings and recovering specialized single-agent theoretical guarantees. We empirically validate our approach to a stochastic data summarization problem, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework, even in single-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent reinforcement learning using echo-state network and its application to pedestrian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, simulations of pedestrians using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied. This study considered the roads on a grid-world environment, and implemented pedestrians as MARL agents using an echo-state network and the least squares policy iteration method. Under this environment, the ability of these agents to learn to move forward by avoiding other agents was investigated. Specifically, we considered two types of tasks: the choice between a narrow direct route and a broad detour, and the bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor. The simulations results indicated that the learning was successful when the density of the agents was not that high.</description>

      <title>Composite Distributed Learning and Synchronization of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems with Complete Uncertain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of composite synchronization and learning control in a network of multi-agent robotic manipulator systems with heterogeneous nonlinear uncertainties under a leader-follower framework. A novel two-layer distributed adaptive learning control strategy is introduced, comprising a first-layer distributed cooperative estimator and a second-layer decentralized deterministic learning controller. The first layer is to facilitate each robotic agent's estimation of the leader's information. The second layer is responsible for both controlling individual robot agents to track desired reference trajectories and accurately identifying/learning their nonlinear uncertain dynamics. The proposed distributed learning control scheme represents an advancement in the existing literature due to its ability to manage robotic agents with completely uncertain dynamics including uncertain mass matrices. This allows the robotic control to be environment-independent which can be used in various settings, from underwater to space where identifying system dynamics parameters is challenging. The stability and parameter convergence of the closed-loop system are rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Fair Voting Outcomes with Impact and Novelty Compromises? Unraveling Biases of Equal Shares in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Participatory budgeting, as a paradigm for democratic innovations, engages citizens in the distribution of a public budget to projects, which they propose and vote for implementation. So far, voting algorithms have been devised and studied in social choice literature to elect projects that are popular, while others prioritize on a proportional representation of voters' preferences, for instance, equal shares. However, the anticipated impact and novelty in the broader society by the winning projects, as selected by different algorithms, remains totally under-explored, lacking both a universal theory of impact for voting and a rigorous framework for impact and novelty assessments. This papers tackles this grand challenge towards new axiomatic foundations for designing effective and fair voting methods. This is via new and striking insights derived from a large-scale analysis of biases over 345 real-world voting outcomes, characterized for the first time by a novel portfolio of impact and novelty metrics. We find strong causal evidence that equal shares comes with impact loss in several infrastructural projects of different cost levels that have been so far over-represented. However, it also comes with a novel, yet over-represented, impact gain in welfare, education and culture. We discuss broader implications of these results and how impact loss can be mitigated at the stage of campaign design and project ideation.</description>

      <title>Communication-Constrained Multi-Robot Exploration with Intermittent Rendezvous</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13494v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the Multi-robot Exploration (MRE) under communication constraints problem. We propose a novel intermittent rendezvous method that allows robots to explore an unknown environment while sharing maps at rendezvous locations through agreements. In our method, robots update the agreements to spread the rendezvous locations during the exploration and prioritize exploring unknown areas near them. To generate the agreements automatically, we reduced the MRE to instances of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and ensured intermittent communication through a temporal connectivity graph. We evaluate our method in simulation in various virtual urban environments and a Gazebo simulation using the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our results suggest that our method can be better than using relays or maintaining intermittent communication with a base station since we can explore faster without additional hardware to create a relay network.</description>

      <title>Self-Healing Distributed Swarm Formation Control Using Image Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-swarm interaction is facilitated by a low- dimensional encoding of the swarm formation, independent of the (possibly large) number of robots. We propose using image moments to encode two-dimensional formations of robots. Each robot knows its pose and the desired formation moments, and simultaneously estimates the current moments of the entire swarm while controlling its motion to better achieve the desired group moments. The estimator is a distributed optimization, requiring no centralized processing, and self-healing, meaning that the process is robust to initialization errors, packet drops, and robots being added to or removed from the swarm. Our experimental results with a swarm of 50 robots, suffering nearly 50% packet loss, show that distributed estimation and control of image moments effectively achieves desired swarm formations.</description>

      <title>Critical mobility in policy making for epidemic containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When considering airborne epidemic spreading in social systems, a natural connection arises between mobility and epidemic contacts. As individuals travel, possibilities to encounter new people either at the final destination or during the transportation process appear. Such contacts can lead to new contagion events. In fact, mobility has been a crucial target for early non-pharmaceutical containment measures against the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with a degree of intensity ranging from public transportation line closures to regional, city or even home confinements. Nonetheless, quantitative knowledge on the relationship between mobility-contagions and, consequently, on the efficiency of containment measures remains elusive. Here we introduce an agent-based model with a simple interaction between mobility and contacts. Despite its simplicity our model shows the emergence of a critical mobility level, inducing major outbreaks when surpassed. We explore the interplay between mobility restrictions and the infection in recent intervention policies seen across many countries, and how interventions in the form of closures triggered by incidence rates can guide the epidemic into an oscillatory regime with recurrent waves. We consider how the different interventions impact societal well-being, the economy and the population. Finally, we propose a mitigation framework based on the critical nature of mobility in an epidemic, able to suppress incidence and oscillations at will, preventing extreme incidence peaks with potential to saturate health care resources.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in the Face of Environmental Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To overcome the sim-to-real gap in reinforcement learning (RL), learned policies must maintain robustness against environmental uncertainties. While robust RL has been widely studied in single-agent regimes, in multi-agent environments, the problem remains understudied -- despite the fact that the problems posed by environmental uncertainties are often exacerbated by strategic interactions. This work focuses on learning in distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs), a robust variant of standard Markov games, wherein each agent aims to learn a policy that maximizes its own worst-case performance when the deployed environment deviates within its own prescribed uncertainty set. This results in a set of robust equilibrium strategies for all agents that align with classic notions of game-theoretic equilibria. Assuming a non-adaptive sampling mechanism from a generative model, we propose a sample-efficient model-based algorithm (DRNVI) with finite-sample complexity guarantees for learning robust variants of various notions of game-theoretic equilibria. We also establish an information-theoretic lower bound for solving RMGs, which confirms the near-optimal sample complexity of DRNVI with respect to problem-dependent factors such as the size of the state space, the target accuracy, and the horizon length.</description>

      <title>LLMs with Personalities in Multi-issue Negotiation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powered by large language models (LLMs), AI agents have become capable of many human tasks. Using the most canonical definitions of the Big Five personality, we measure the ability of LLMs to negotiate within a game-theoretical framework, as well as methodological challenges to measuring notions of fairness and risk. Simulations (n=1,500) for both single-issue and multi-issue negotiation reveal increase in domain complexity with asymmetric issue valuations improve agreement rates but decrease surplus from aggressive negotiation. Through gradient-boosted regression and Shapley explainers, we find high openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are associated with fair tendencies; low agreeableness and low openness are associated with rational tendencies. Low conscientiousness is associated with high toxicity. These results indicate that LLMs may have built-in guardrails that default to fair behavior, but can be "jail broken" to exploit agreeable opponents. We also offer pragmatic insight in how negotiation bots can be designed, and a framework of assessing negotiation behavior based on game theory and computational social science.</description>
