      <title>Photon Antibunching from Superposed Squeezed Vacua via Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon antibunching ($g^{(2)}(0) &lt; 1$), a hallmark of nonclassical light crucial for quantum technologies, is typically absent in Gaussian squeezed vacuum states, which inherently exhibit photon bunching ($g^{(2)}(0) &gt; 1$). We theoretically demonstrate that quantum superpositions of two single-mode squeezed vacuum states with equal squeezing can, counterintuitively, lead to strong photon antibunching. By analytically deriving the second-order coherence $g^{(2)}(0)$, we show that quantum interference between the non-orthogonal squeezed components allows for precise tuning of photon statistics into regimes forbidden to individual squeezed states, achieving a minimum $g^{(2)}$ value as low as $0.567$. Our results highlight a new dimension of quantum control in engineered states of light, with implications for quantum information processing, precision metrology, and the foundational understanding of nonclassicality in optical fields.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Time Crystals Made of Electron-Positron Pairs': Parity Considerations and Numerical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we critically examine the established findings of a seminal study [arXiv:2105.04346], noting a significant discrepancy: Figures F9-F11 suggest that functions $\phi_1(y)$ and $\phi_2(y)$ exhibit parity (even/odd symmetry), while Equation (21) fails to reflect this property. Our numerical analyses substantiate this inconsistency. Additionally, we observe that the derivation of Transformation (20) lacks sufficient physical grounding, which warrants further scrutiny. In light of these observations, we introduce a novel transformation that properly incorporates parity symmetry. This new approach not only resolves the identified inconsistencies but also enhances the overall physical coherence of the framework, building upon the foundational contributions of the original work.</description>

      <title>Scalable Simulation of Fermionic Encoding Performance on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compelling application of quantum computers with thousands of qubits is quantum simulation. Simulating fermionic systems is both a problem with clear real-world applications and a computationally challenging task. In order to simulate a system of fermions on a quantum computer, one has to first map the fermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian. The most popular such mapping is the Jordan-Wigner encoding, which suffers from inefficiencies caused by the high weight of some encoded operators. As a result, alternative local encodings have been proposed that solve this problem at the expense of a constant factor increase in the number of qubits required. Some such encodings possess local stabilizers, i.e., Pauli operators that act as the logical identity on the encoded fermionic modes. A natural error mitigation approach in these cases is to measure the stabilizers and discard any run where a measurement returns a -1 outcome. Using a high-performance stabilizer simulator, we classically simulate the performance of a local encoding known as the Derby-Klassen encoding and compare its performance with the Jordan-Wigner encoding and the ternary tree encoding. Our simulations use more complex error models and significantly larger system sizes (up to $18\times18$) than in previous work. We find that the high sampling requirements of postselection methods with the Derby-Klassen encoding pose a limitation to its applicability in near-term devices and call for more encoding-specific circuit optimizations.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics can find a needle in a haystack every time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm is one of the pioneering demonstrations of the advantages of quantum computing over its classical counterpart, providing - at most - a quadratic speed-up over the classical solution for unstructured database search. The original formulation of Grover's algorithm is non-deterministic, finding the answer with a probability that varies with the size of the search space and the number of marked elements. A recent reformulation introduced a deterministic form of Grover's algorithm that - in principle - finds the answer with certainty. Here we realise the deterministic Grover's algorithm on a programmable photonic integrated circuit, finding that it not only outperforms the original Grover's algorithm as predicted, but is also markedly more robust against technological imperfections. We explore databases of 4 to 10 elements, with every choice of a single marked element, achieving an average success probability of $99.77 \pm 0.05\%$.</description>

      <title>Direct Polarization-Entangled Photon Pair Generation Using Domain-Engineered Nonlinear Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bi-photon polarization-frequency entanglement source was realized by shaping the phase-matching function of a poled KTP crystal. It provides a simple method to achieve either polarization or spectral entanglement in a simple collinear setup, based on single-pass SPDC and a dichroic (or polarizing) beam splitter. This is a robust and cost-effective configuration that can be easily implemented outside the laboratory environment. We characterized the source by two approaches: reconstructing the density matrix of the generated state with quantum state tomography, by recording the coincidences across 16 mutual polarization settings, in addition to a new method based on quantifying the symmetry of the joint spectral intensity by swapping between the signal and idler wavelengths. The polarization-entangled source violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with a measured $S=2.747\pm 0.004$. We also measured the polarization entanglement visibility in two mutually unbiased polarization bases and evaluated the squeezing level by characterizing the reduction in visibility at high pump power.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entanglement-sustaining sequential local quantum state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two pure orthogonal quantum states can be perfectly distinguished by sequential local action of multiple pairs of parties. However, this process typically leads to the complete dissolution of entanglement in the states being discriminated. We propose a protocol that allows an arbitrary number of pairs of parties to distinguish between any two orthogonal, entangled, two-qubit pure states using local quantum operations and classical communication, with a success probability greater than that of random guessing, while ensuring that at each step, the individual ensemble states retain a finite amount of entanglement. Our protocol employs the minimum-error state discrimination approach. For demonstrating the retention of entanglement in the ensemble states at each step, we use logarithmic negativity as well as the concept of entanglement witnessing. For a large family of sets of the two states, the success probability of discrimination can be as close as required to unity, while sustaining a finite amount of entanglement in each step.</description>

      <title>Classical analog circuit emulation of quantum Grover search algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a completely analog framework that emulates universal quantum gates and quantum algorithms. It is based on electronic circuits made of operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors. In these circuits, input and output lines represent the computational basis states (CBSs) and thus $2^n$ lines are required to represent $n$ qubits. An operation of the circuits is based on classical evolution and interference of complex amplitudes associated with each CBS. The framework can emulate entangled states and is free from decoherence, measurements are classical and do not collapse states. Similar to physical quantum computers, emulated quantum algorithms can be constructed as a sequence of the gates belonging to a universal set (phase shift, Hadamard, controlled-NOT), as a unitary matrix and as combinations of the two. Circuits representing the universal gates have been made and tested. We also have made a matrix-based emulator of a 3-qubit Grover search algorithm. We tested it by searching for one and two particular states with one and two iterations and found that its outputs accurately match predicted values. We anticipate that the emulators can work as sub-components of physical quantum computers. On their own, the emulators can be used for operations that require a few qubits or operations that can be split into independent (and perhaps weakly entangled) blocks of qubits.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules, helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a twisted electron wave packet perturbed by an inhomogeneous electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) wave packets, known for their vortex structure and nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), are of great interest in various scientific fields. Here we study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a spatially-localized electron LG wave packet interacting with an inhomogeneous external electric field that violates the axial symmetry of the initial wave function. We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its qualitative form. We demonstrate that due to the interaction with the external field, the degenerate zeros of the initial wave function located on the $z$ axis split into multiple nondegenerate nodes in the transverse plane representing separate single-charge vortices. This mechanism resembles the analogous effects known in topological optics. These findings provide new insights into controlling and manipulating twisted matter beams and into their possible instabilities.</description>

      <title>Machine learning non-Markovian two-level quantum noise spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop machine learning models for the automated characterization of quantum noise spectroscopy for non-Hermitian two-level systems. We use the Random Forest, Support Vector and Feed-Forward Neural Network regression algorithms to perform a highly accurate regression of the two-level system-bath coupling strength. High accuracy Ohmicity classification was implemented to provide a complete characterization of the spectral density function. We define a time-averaged trace-distance metric to feed the machine learning algorithms which, together with numerically exact populations as inputs, produce a highly accurate non-Markovian regression spanning the transition from fast to slow baths and from weak to strong coupling regimes of the interaction. The dynamics database of the non-Hermitian systems has been built up within the independent spin-boson and pure dephasing model.</description>

      <title>Cavity Optomechanical Quantum Memory for Twisted Photons Using a Ring BEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) quantum memory platform based on an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring trap and placed inside a Fabry-Perot cavity driven by Laguerre-Gaussian beams. In contrast to electromagnetically induced transparency-based protocols, our memory does not require change of internal atomic levels. The optical states are instead stored in the large Hilbert space of topologically protected and long-lived motional states (persistent currents) of the condensate, yielding a storage time three orders of magnitude better than presently available. Further, the use of a cavity provides orders of magnitude more resonances, and hence bandwidth, for reading and writing than internal atomic transitions. Finally, the analogy to cavity optomechanics suggests a natural path to wavelength conversion, OAM transduction, and nondestructive readout of the memory.</description>

      <title>Remote entanglement generation via enhanced quantum state transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving robust and scalable remote quantum entanglement is a fundamental challenge for the development of distributed quantum networks and modular quantum computing systems. Along this, perfect state transfer (PST) and fractional state transfer (FST) have emerged as promising schemes for quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation using only nearest-neighbor couplings. However, the current implementations suffer from quantum loss and limited parameter tunability. In this work, we propose a new quantum state transfer scheme based on a zig-zag configuration, which introduces a controlling parameter for PST and FST. We show that this new parameter can suppress the population in the intermediate qubits, thereby reducing losses. We experimentally demonstrate the dynamics of different configurations on a superconducting quantum processor, achieving an $18\%$ reduction in error for remote Bell state generation in a 1D ($1\times5$) qubit chain, and exhibit robustness against certain types of noise. Then we extend our approach to a 2D network, successfully generating a W state among the four corner qubits. These results highlight the potential of our enhanced quantum state transfer scheme for scalable and noise-resilient quantum communication and computing.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum phase transition in parametrized quantum circuits with an attention mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning many-body quantum states and quantum phase transitions remains a major challenge in quantum many-body physics. Classical machine learning methods offer certain advantages in addressing these difficulties. In this work, we propose a novel framework that bypasses the need to measure physical observables by directly learning the parameters of parameterized quantum circuits. By integrating the attention mechanism from large language models (LLMs) with a variational autoencoder (VAE), we efficiently capture hidden correlations within the circuit parameters. These correlations allow us to extract information about quantum phase transitions in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, our VAE acts as a classical representation of parameterized quantum circuits and the corresponding many-body quantum states, enabling the efficient generation of quantum states associated with specific phases. We apply our framework to a variety of quantum systems and demonstrate its broad applicability, with particularly strong performance in identifying topological quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters serve as essential on-demand photonic resources, generating quantum states of light such as single photons and entangled photon pairs while serving as interfaces between light and matter. Buried in the solid state, quantum emitters enable a straightforward adoption of advanced nanofabrication techniques, facilitating precise engineering of their photonic environment for scalable quantum technologies. In this review, we introduce the fundamentals of quantum emitters and the key metrics characterising their performance. We highlight three material platforms: quantum dots, defect centres in diamond, and defect centres in silicon carbide. We summarise the recent developments of these platforms and discuss their advancements in quantum applications, including quantum communication, computation, and sensing. Finally, we provide a comparison across the three platforms, along with an outlook on future directions and potential challenges.</description>

      <title>QML Essentials -- A framework for working with Quantum Fourier Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework in the form of a Python package, specifically designed for the analysis of Quantum Machine Learning models. This framework is based on the PennyLane simulator and facilitates the evaluation and training of Variational Quantum Circuits. It provides additional functionality ranging from the ability to add different types of noise to the classical simulation, over different parameter initialisation strategies, to the calculation of expressibility and entanglement for a given model. As an intrinsic property of Quantum Fourier Models, it provides two methods for calculating the corresponding Fourier spectrum: one via the Fast Fourier Transform and another analytical method based on the expansion of the expectation value using trigonometric polynomials. It also provides a set of predefined approaches that allow a fast and straightforward implementation of Quantum Machine Learning models. With this framework, we extend the PennyLane simulator with a set of tools that allow researchers a more convenient start with Quantum Fourier Models and aim to unify the analysis of Variational Quantum Circuits.</description>

Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. The optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. We prove these inequalities in the cases of state ensembles corresponding to acute or flat pyramids, thus providing the proof of the hypothesis concerning the globally information-optimal observable.</description>

      <title>Depth-Optimal Quantum Layout Synthesis as SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after (CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However, taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise reduction.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Architecture Search with Surrogate Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum algorithms and their practical applications currently relies heavily on the efficient design, compilation, and optimization of quantum circuits. In particular, parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), which serve as the basis for variational quantum algorithms~(VQAs), demand carefully engineered architectures that balance performance with hardware constraints. Despite recent progress, identifying structural features of PQCs that enhance trainability, noise resilience, and overall algorithmic performance remains an active area of research. Addressing these challenges, quantum architecture search (QAS) aims to automate the design of problem-specific PQCs by systematically exploring circuit architectures to optimize algorithmic performance, often with varying degrees of consideration for hardware constraints. However, comparing QAS methods is challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark evaluation pipeline, and the high resource demands. In this paper, we present SQuASH, the Surrogate Quantum Architecture Search Helper, a benchmark that leverages surrogate models to enable uniform comparison of QAS methods and considerably accelerate their evaluation. We present the methodology for creating a surrogate benchmark for QAS and demonstrate its capability to accelerate the execution and comparison of QAS methods. Additionally, we provide the code required to integrate SQuASH into custom QAS methods, enabling not only benchmarking but also the use of surrogate models for rapid prototyping. We further release the dataset used to train the surrogate models, facilitating reproducibility and further research.</description>

      <title>Adam assisted Fully informed Particle Swarm Optimzation ( Adam-FIPSO ) based Parameter Prediction for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent variational algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the Max-Cut problem. A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Partial order and topology of Hermitian matrices and quantum Choquet integrals for density matrices with given expectation values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set $M$ of $d\times d$ Hermitian matrices (observables) is studied as a partially ordered set with the L\"{o}wner partial order. Upper and lower sets in it, define the concept of cumulativeness (used mainly with scalar quantities) in the context of Hermitian matrices. Partial order and topology are intimately related to each other and the set $M$ of Hermitian matrices is also studied as a topological space, where open and closed sets are the upper and lower sets. It is shown that the set $M$ of Hermitian matrices is a $T_0$ topological space, and its subset ${\mathfrak D}$ of density matrices is Hausdorff totally disconnected topological space. These ideas are a prerequisite for studying quantum Choquet integrals with Hermitian matrices (as opposed to classical Choquet integrals with scalar quantities). Capacities (non-additive probabilities), cumulative quantities that involve Hermitian matrices, and M\"obius transforms that remove the overlaps between non-commuting observables, are used in quantum Choquet integrals. An application of the formalism is to find a density matrix, with given expectation values with respect to $n$ (non-commuting) observables. Examples of calculations of such a density matrix (with quantified errors in its expectation values), are presented.</description>

      <title>Hadamard-$\Pi$: Equational Quantum Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $\Pi$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory, enabling reasoning about the equivalence of quantum programs in a way that can be automated. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</description>

      <title>Verified Universal Breakdown of Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Fast Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts that when a system is driven through a continuous phase transition, the density of topological defects scales universally with the quench rate. Recent theoretical work [H.-B. Zeng \textit{et al.}, \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} \textbf{130}, 060402 (2023)] has challenged this picture, showing that under sufficiently fast quenches, both the defect density and freezing time become independent of the quench rate and instead scale universally with the quench range. Here, we experimentally test this prediction using a single trapped-ion qubit to simulate fast quantum quenches in the Landau-Zener and 1D Rice-Mele models. We identify a critical quench rate \( v_c \) that scales with the quench range \( \delta_{\max} \), separating two distinct dynamical regimes. In the Rice-Mele model, for \( v &lt; v_c \), the defect density follows the KZM scaling \( \sim v^{1/2} \); for \( v &gt; v_c \), it exhibits a universal scaling \( \sim \delta_{\max} \), independent of the quench rate. Our results provide direct experimental evidence of the predicted breakdown of KZM universality under fast quenches.</description>

      <title>A fidelity-driven approach to quantum circuit partitioning via weighted hypergraphs for noise-resilient computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06867v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective circuit partitioning is critical for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are hampered by high error rates and limited qubit connectivity. Standard partitioning heuristics often neglect gate-specific error impacts, leading to suboptimal divisions with significant communication overhead and reduced fidelity. This paper introduces Fidelipart, a novel framework that transforms quantum circuits into a fidelity-aware hypergraph. In this model, gate error rates and structural dependencies inform the weights of nodes (gates) and hyperedges (representing multi-qubit interactions and qubit timelines), guiding an Mt-KaHyPar partitioner to minimize cuts through error-prone operations.
  We evaluated Fidelipart against BQSKit's QuickPartitioner on 6-qubit/22-gate, 10-qubit/55-gate, and 24-qubit/88-gate benchmarks under a linear topology with a consistent local contiguous re-mapping strategy. Results demonstrate Fidelipart's superior performance. It achieved SWAP gate reductions ranging from 77.3% to 100% and up to a 52.2% decrease in cut qubits. These physical improvements directly translated to estimated fidelity gains ranging from 27.3% to over 250%. While Fidelipart showed a modest runtime increase of 8-13% and variable effects on maximum partition depth, its substantial enhancement of circuit fidelity highlights the significant benefits of integrating detailed error-awareness into the partitioning process for more reliable NISQ computations.</description>

      <title>Memory cost of quantum contextuality with Pauli observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically simulating the quantum contextual correlations produced by sequences of ideal measurements of compatible observables requires the measured system to have an internal memory. Computing the minimum amount of memory needed is, in general, challenging. Here, building upon the work of Kleinmann et al. [New J. Phys. 13, 113011 (2011)], we prove that the memory cost for simulating the contextuality produced by the $10$ three-qubit observables of Mermin's pentagram is only $\log_2(5) \approx 2.32$ bits, but the memory cost for simulating the contextuality produced by all $15$ two-qubit Pauli observables is, at least, $\log_2(6) \approx 2.58$ bits, thus exceeding the classical capacity of the system on which the measurements are performed. We also add results on the memory for simulating some subsets of quantum predictions.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of an All-Optical Toffoli Gate using Soliton Scattering through Asymmetric Potential Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and numerically simulate an all-optical Toffoli (controlled-controlled-NOT) gate based on the scattering of spatial solitons by asymmetric P\"oschl-Teller potential wells. In our scheme, the logical state of the target bit is encoded in the relative spatial ordering of two distinguishable soliton components, while the control bits are represented by the presence or absence of external potential wells. We solve the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations governing the soliton dynamics and systematically scan soliton amplitude and velocity, analyzing reflection and transmission coefficients to identify the operational conditions for Toffoli gate behavior. Our results demonstrate that introducing asymmetry in the potential wells significantly broadens the operational parameter window compared to symmetric configurations. We also investigate the impacts of varying degrees of asymmetry and soliton amplitude on gate performance. Furthermore, we examine the influence of weak inter-component coupling and confirm that it is not essential for gate operation. These findings generalize earlier soliton-based CNOT simulations and support the broader feasibility of classical analog modeling of multi-qubit logic gates in nonlinear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating discrete-time quantum walk with urn model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urn models have long been used to study stochastic processes, probability distributions, and reinforcement dynamics. Meanwhile, discrete time quantum walks (DTQW) serve as fundamental components in quantum computation and quantum information theory. This work explores a novel connection between an urn model and discrete-time quantum walks, focusing on how urn-based stochastic processes can provide insights into quantum state evolution and algorithmic behavior. Importantly, our model operates entirely with real-valued quantities, without relying on complex amplitudes of the quantum walk. Every stochastic rule is derived from urn-based processes, whose parameters are governed by the coin and shift mechanisms of the quantum walk, maintaining the structural dynamics of the DTQW. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to bridge classical and quantum frameworks, offering new perspectives on both quantum algorithms and stochastic modeling. This work connects the urn model to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.</description>

      <title>Quantum transduction via generalized continuous-variable teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transduction converts quantum states between different frequencies. Similarly, quantum teleportation transfers quantum states between different systems. While often appreciated for quantum communication between distant locations, teleportation can also operate between different frequencies. In terms of bosonic modes, quantum teleportation relies on two-mode squeezing -- squeezed on the balanced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) quadratures -- for entanglement and a balanced beamsplitter plus homodyne detection for Bell measurement. Since cross-frequency band entanglement is challenging to generate, we propose to enable transduction with teleportation, while only relying on a conventional transduction device and narrow-band entanglement. Our insight is that a transduction device performs a cross-frequency-band beamsplitter, almost what is needed in a Bell measurement, except that it is often not balanced. We resolve the issue by proposing a generalized teleportation protocol with arbitrarily unbalanced EPR quadratures and matched unbalanced beamsplitters. The protocol can enhance quantum transduction, using only off-the-shelf components -- intraband beamsplitters, offline squeezing, homodyne detection and displacements. The proposed protocol achieves perfect transduction when applying to a transduction device with an arbitrarily low efficiency, at infinite squeezing. A minimum squeezing in the range of [1.195,4.343] decibels is needed to achieve quantum capacity enhancement.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the role of vector potential in the Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most popular interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is that the electromagnetic potential locally affects the complex phase of a charged particle's wave function in the magnetic field free region. However, since the vector potential is a gauge-variant quantity, not a few researchers suspect that it is just a convenient tool for calculating the force field. This motivates them to explain the AB effect without using the vector potential, which inevitably leads to some sort of non-locality. This frustrating situation is shortly summarized by the statement of Aharonov et al. that the AB effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant fields. In the present paper, we shall give several convincing arguments, which support the viewpoint that the vector potential is not just a convenient mathematical tool with little physical entity. Despite its gauge arbitrariness, the vector potential certainly contains a gauge-invariant piece, which solely explains the observed AB phase shift. Importantly, this component has a property such that it is basically unique and cannot be eliminated by any regular gauge transformations. To make the discussion complete, we also discuss the role of remaining gauge arbitrariness still contained in the entire vector potential.</description>

      <title>Inline Quantum Measurements with SNSPDs Coupled to Photonic Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are enabling components of quantum photonic integrated circuits for their ease of fabrication and unsurpassed performance. While several approaches for SNSPDs integration are being pursued, scalability and interfacing with electrical readout circuits remain challenging. Here we introduce the concept of inline detection with SNSPDs, facilitating advanced quantum measurements within an ultra-compact device footprint. To establish this approach, we develop a photonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) platform based on etchless polymer waveguides, which substantially suppress parasitic scattering at detector terminations while ensuring compatibility with standard photonic substrates and cryogenic operation. We show BIC-coupled inline detectors with on-chip efficiency exceeding 80%, recovery time of less than 2 ns, and intrinsic jitter of less than 70 ps. As a proof of principle, we implement a Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometer with footprint of 60x6 um2, and a photon number resolving detector for discrimination of collinear photon pairs. The demonstration of accurate and reliable inline quantum measurements within a simple and scalable photonic architecture offers a viable pathway to realize more complex quantum circuit functionalities, such as higher-order correlation measurements, quantum state tomography, and multi-photon subtraction.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithms with invariant probabilistic error cancellation on noisy quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, emerging classical-quantum hybrid optimization algorithms, such as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), can leverage the unique characteristics of quantum devices to accelerate computations tailored to specific problems with shallow circuits. However, these algorithms encounter biases and iteration difficulties due to significant noise in quantum processors. These difficulties can only be partially addressed without error correction by optimizing hardware, reducing circuit complexity, or fitting and extrapolation. A compelling solution is applying probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), a quantum error mitigation technique that enables unbiased results without full error correction. Traditional PEC is challenging to apply in VQAs due to its variance amplification, contradicting iterative process assumptions. This paper proposes a novel noise-adaptable strategy that combines PEC with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). It is implemented through invariant sampling circuits (invariant-PEC, or IPEC) and substantially reduces iteration variance. This strategy marks the first successful integration of PEC and QAOA, resulting in efficient convergence. Moreover, we introduce adaptive partial PEC (APPEC), which modulates the error cancellation proportion of IPEC during iteration. We experimentally validated this technique on a superconducting quantum processor, cutting sampling cost by 90.1\%. Notably, we find that dynamic adjustments of error levels via APPEC can enhance escape from local minima and reduce sampling costs. These results open promising avenues for executing VQAs with large-scale, low-noise quantum circuits, paving the way for practical quantum computing advancements.</description>

      <title>Experimental Efficient Influence Sampling of Quantum Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum processes paves the way for unlocking the full potential of quantum systems. However, quantum process tomography demands intensive resources and becomes infeasible on large-scale quantum devices. Other methods have explored advanced strategies, yet challenges in experimental feasibility and scalability persist. To address this issues, we introduce influence sampling that efficiently extracts the key \textit{influence} of a quantum process on qubit subsets using at most three distinct single-qubit test gates. Using a photonic platform, we experimentally demonstrate influence sampling and apply it to testing and learning quantum junta processes, determining whether a process acts non-trivially on only a subset of qubits and subsequently learning that process. In addition, we confirm the scalability of influence sampling by deploying it in larger systems. These results establish influence sampling as a powerful and scalable process characterization technique, facilitating efficient device assessment and noisy qubit identification.</description>

      <title>Certification of High-Dimensional Entanglement Within the Resource Theory of Buscemi Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study on the certification of high degree entanglement, which is quantified in terms of Schmidt number, attracts much attention recently. Drawing inspiration from the work [PRX QUANTUM 2, 020301 (2021)], we first introduce resource theories of distributed measurements and teleportation instruments generated by a bipartite mixed state. Next we quantitatively characterized the relations among the convex resource theories of distributed measurements, teleportation instruments, and bipartite mixed states. At last, we show that high-dimensional entanglement provides advantages in a state discrimination game, and the advantages can be quantified by the Schmidt-number robustness.</description>

      <title>Quantum SAT Problems with Finite Sets of Projectors are Complete for a Plethora of Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, all known variants of the Quantum Satisfiability (QSAT) problem, i.e. deciding whether a $k$-local ($k$-body) Hamiltonian is frustration-free, could be classified as being either in $\mathsf{P}$; or complete for $\mathsf{NP}$, $\mathsf{MA}$, or $\mathsf{QMA_1}$. Here, we demonstrate new qubit variants of this problem that are complete for $\mathsf{BQP_1}$, $\mathsf{coRP}$, $\mathsf{QCMA}$, $\mathsf{PI(coRP,NP)}$, $\mathsf{PI(BQP_1,NP)}$, $\mathsf{PI(BQP_1,MA)}$, $\mathsf{SoPU(coRP,NP)}$, $\mathsf{SoPU(BQP_1,NP)}$, and $\mathsf{SoPU(BQP_1,MA)}$. Our result implies that a complete classification of quantum constraint satisfaction problems (QCSPs), analogous to Schaefer's dichotomy theorem for classical CSPs, must either include these 13 classes, or otherwise show that some are equal. Additionally, our result showcases two new types of QSAT problems that can be decided efficiently, as well as the first nontrivial $\mathsf{BQP_1}$-complete problem. We first prove there are qudit QSAT problems that are complete for $\mathsf{BQP_1}$, $\mathsf{coRP}$, and $\mathsf{QCMA}$ by re-defining elements of the circuit-to-Hamiltonian transformation. We then show that any QCSP can be reduced to a problem in qubits while maintaining the same complexity - something believed not to be possible classically. The remaining six problems are obtained by considering "sums" and "products" of the first seven QSAT problems. Before this work, the QSAT problems generated in this way resulted in complete problems for $\mathsf{PI}$ and $\mathsf{SoPU}$ classes that were trivially equal to other known classes. We thus commence the study of these new and seemingly nontrivial classes. While [Meiburg, 2021] first sought to prove completeness for the first three classes, we note that his constructions are flawed. Here, we rework them and obtain improvements on the required qudit dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Engineering and harnessing long-range interactions for atomic quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between quantum particles, such as electrons, are the source of important effects, ranging from superconductivity, to the formation of molecular bonds, or the stability of elementary compounds at high-energies. In this article, we illustrate how advances in the cold-atom community to further engineer such long-range interactions have stimulated the simulation of new regimes of these fundamental many-body problems. The goal is two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena to the study of lattice gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital simulation and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations in molecular cavity optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information, quantum correlations--particularly entanglement, EPR steering, and quantum discord--stand as interesting resources, powering breakthroughs from secure communication and quantum teleportation to efficient quantum computation. Here, we unveil a theoretical framework for generating and controlling these vital quantum phenomena within a double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system. This innovative approach leverages strong interactions between confined optical fields and collective molecular vibrations, creating a versatile environment for exploring robust quantum correlations. Our findings reveal that judiciously optimizing the coupling strength between the cavity field and the molecular collective mode leads to a remarkable enhancement of entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord. We demonstrate that cavity-cavity quantum correlations can be effectively mediated by the molecular collective mode, enabling a unique pathway for inter-cavity quantum connectivity. Moreover, the quantum entanglement generated in our McOM system exhibits robustness against thermal noise, persisting at temperatures approaching 1000 K. This strong resilience, qualifies molecular optomechanics as a compelling architecture for scalable, room-temperature quantum information processing and the practical realization of quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Experimental memory control in continuous variable optical quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a promising framework for online quantum-enhanced machine learning tailored to temporal tasks, yet practical implementations with native memory capabilities remain limited. Here, we demonstrate an optical QRC platform based on deterministically generated multimode squeezed states, exploiting both spectral and temporal multiplexing in a fully continuous-variable (CV) setting, and enabling controlled fading memory. Data is encoded via programmable phase shaping of the pump in an optical parametric process and retrieved through mode-selective homodyne detection. Real-time memory is achieved through feedback using electro-optic phase modulation, while long-term dependencies are achieved via spatial multiplexing. This architecture with minimal post-processing performs nonlinear temporal tasks, including parity checking and chaotic signal forecasting, with results corroborated by a high-fidelity Digital Twin. We show that leveraging the entangled multimode structure significantly enhances the expressivity and memory capacity of the quantum reservoir. This work establishes a scalable photonic platform for quantum machine learning, operating in CV encoding and supporting practical quantum-enhanced information processing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Measurement Precision of Non-Degenerate Two-Photon Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown that squeezed states of light can be engineered to enhance the resolution of nonlinear optical measurements. Here, we analyze non-degenerate two-photon absorption signals obtained from transmission measurements using two-mode squeezed light and compare different measurement strategies. In particular, we investigate how correlations between the light modes may be used to improve the achievable precision. We find that intensity correlation measurements offer the best performance compared to normalized intensity correlation and noise reduction factor approaches. Under experimental imperfections modeled as linear photon losses, the enhancements from intensity and noise reduction measurements are reduced. In contrast, the normalized intensity correlation remains robust to loss, though this comes at the cost of losing the enhancement from non-classical light fields. This establishes a trade-off between robustness to loss and the achievable quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Generalized measurements for Bell tests in different probability spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell tests are of profound statistical nature. Besides physical considerations, the proper understanding of their implications should involve detailed statistical analyses. In this regard, recent works have shown that their consequences and interpretations depend on the probability space adopted. Some other recent works have also shown that generalized measurements may allow to further exploit the statistics of Bell-like tests. Following these ideas, in this work we show that one and the same experimental arrangement can provide a practical scheme valid for two very different probability spaces. Moreover, we show that this allows the introduction of novel Bell tests that are not possible in more standard approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the coherent transport of one or two photons in a one-dimensional waveguide chirally coupled to a dissipative nonlinear cavity. The scattering amplitudes were derived analytically. With the assist of dissipation, we can realize an ideal optical diode at the single-photon level, i. e., the transmittance is unity from one side and zero form the other side. The working area and properties of the two-photon diode are also found. This work details the relation between the diode effect and our system parameters, especially dissipation, which may find it applications in nonreciprocal quantum devices and quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information-Theoretical Size Bounds for Conjunctive Queries with Functional Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving formulations for computing and estimating tight worst-case size increases for conjunctive queries with various constraints has been at the core of theoretical database research. If the problem has no constraints or only one constraint, such as functional dependencies or degree constraints, tight worst-case size bounds have been proven, and they are even practically computable. If the problem has more than one constraint, computing tight bounds can be difficult in practice and may even require an infinite number of linear inequalities in its optimization formulation. While these challenges have been addressed with varying methods, no prior research has employed quantum information theory to address this problem. In this work, we establish a connection between earlier work on estimating size bounds for conjunctive queries with classical information theory and the field of quantum information theory. We propose replacing the classical Shannon entropy formulation with the quantum R\'enyi entropy. Whereas classical Shannon entropy requires infinitely many inequalities to characterize the optimization space, R\'enyi entropy requires only one type of inequality, which is non-negativity. Although this is a promising modification, optimization with respect to the quantum states instead of classical distributions creates a new set of challenges that prevent us from finding a practically computable, tight worst-case size bound. In this line, we propose a quantum version to derive worst-case size bounds. The previous tight classical worst-case size bound can be viewed as a special limit of this quantum bound. We also provide a comprehensive background on prior research and discuss the future possibilities of quantum information theory in theoretical database research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metronome synchronization and the transition between the in-phase and anti-phase synchronization have been observed in classical systems. We demonstrate the quantum analog of this phenomenon in a two-qubit system coupled to a common environment. Tracing out the environment in the quantum collision model, we obtain an effective master equation with a two-body dissipator for two qubits. Quenching the two-body dissipator, we demonstrate controlled transitions from in-phase to anti-phase synchronization. This synchronization transition is robust against noise. Signatures of the transition are observed through Pearson correlation coefficient measurements obtained via quantum simulations on superconducting circuits. Future experiments employing qutrit systems are expected to yield a more pronounced effect.</description>

      <title>Error-Mitigated Quantum Metrology via Probabilistic Virtual Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology stands as a leading application of quantum science and technology, yet its precision and sensitivity are often constrained by noise. In the context of near-term quantum metrology, quantum error mitigation offers a promising strategy to leverage quantum resources. While existing error-mitigated protocols largely depend on virtual state purification, significant noise accumulation and the additional noise introduced by the noisy implementations of these protocols can impede the effectiveness. To address these problems, we propose probabilistic virtual channel purification to handle the largely accumulated noise while efficiently canceling additional noise from itself. This also naturally leads to an enhanced version of virtual state purification, namely probabilistic virtual state purification. Within the sequential scheme of quantum metrology, our error analysis reveals a significant reduction in bias and a quantum advantage in sampling cost when the number of channels encoding the interested parameters is $O(p^{-1})$, where $p$ is the error rate of the encoding channel. In this range, both probabilistic virtual purification methods demonstrate significant improvements in parameter estimation precision and robustness against practical noise, as evidenced by numerical simulations for both single- and multi-parameter tasks.</description>

      <title>Notes on Real Quantum Mechanics in a Kahler Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The necessity of complex numbers in quantum mechanics has long been debated. This paper develops a real Kahler space formulation of quantum mechanics [19], asserting equivalence to the standard complex Hilbert space framework. By mapping the complex Hilbert space ${\mathbb C}^n$ to a real Kahler space $K ^{2n}$, i.e. ${\mathbb R}^{2n}$ equipped with a metric, a symplectic structure and an automorphism, we establish a correspondence between Hermitian operators in ${\mathbb C}^n$ and real operators in $K^{2n}$. While the isomorphism appears straightforward some subtleties emerge: (i) the overcounting of composite system states under tensor products in ${\mathbb R}^{2n}$, and (ii) the double degeneracy of operator spectra in the real formulation. Through a systematic investigation of these challenges, we clarify the structural relationship between real and complex formulations, resolve ambiguities in composite system representations, and analyze spectral consequences. Our results reaffirm the equivalence of the two frameworks while highlighting nuanced distinctions with implications for foundational debates on locality, phase invariance, and the role of complex numbers in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical learning and quantum memory with non-Hermitian many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems provide a fertile platform for quantum technologies, owing in part to their distinct dynamical phases. These systems can be characterized by the preservation or spontaneous breaking of parity-time reversal symmetry, significantly impacting the dynamical behavior of quantum resources such as entanglement and purity; resources which in turn govern the system's information processing and memory capacity. Here we investigate this relationship using the example of an interacting NH spin system defined on random graphs. We show that the onset of the first exceptional point - marking the real-to-complex spectral transition - also corresponds to an abrupt change in the system's learning capacity. We further demonstrate that this transition is controllable via local disorder and spin interactions strength, thereby defining a tunable learnability threshold. Within the learning phase, the system exhibits the key features required for memory-dependent reservoir computing. This makes explicit a direct link between spectral structure and computational capacity, further establishing non-Hermiticity, and more broadly engineered dissipation, as a dynamic resource for temporal quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Phase estimation via delocalized photon subtraction operation inside the SU(1,1) interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to improve the precision of phase measurement using intensity detection by implementing delocalized photon subtraction operation (D-PSO) inside the SU(1,1) interferometer, with the coherent state and the vacuum state as the input states. We compare the phase sensitivity and the quantum Fisher information between D-PSO and localized photon subtraction operation (L-PSO) under both ideal and photon-loss cases. It has been found that the D-PSO can improve the measurement accuracy of the SU(1,1) interferometer and enhance its robustness against internal photon loss. And it can cover and even exceed the advantages of the L-PSO on two modes, respectively. In addition, by comparing the standard quantum limit, the Heisenberg limit and quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, we find that the phase sensitivity of the D-PSO can get closer to the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound and has the ability to resist internal loss.</description>

      <title>Limits of Classical correlations and Quantum advantages under (Anti-)Distinguishability constraints in Multipartite Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider communication scenarios with multiple senders and a single receiver. Focusing on communication tasks where the distinguishability or anti-distinguishability of the sender's input is bounded, we show that quantum strategies without any shared entanglement can outperform the classical ones. We introduce a systematic technique for deriving the facet inequalities that delineate the polytope of classical correlations in such scenarios. As a proof of principle, we recover the complete set of facet inequalities for some non-trivial scenarios involving two senders and a receiver with no input. Explicit quantum protocols are studied that violate these inequalities, demonstrating quantum advantage. We further investigate the task of anti-distinguishing the joint input string held by the senders and derive upper bounds on the optimal classical success probability. Leveraging the Pusey Barrett Rudolph theorem, we prove that when each sender has a binary input, the quantum advantage grows with the number of senders. We also provide sufficient conditions for quantum advantage for arbitrary input sizes and illustrate them through several explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Random Exclusion Codes: Quantum Advantages of Single-Shot Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying information tasks that offer advantages over their classical counterparts by exploiting quantum resources finds the usefulness of quantum information technologies. In this work, we introduce a two-party communication primitive, Random Exclusion Code (REC), which is a single-shot prepare-and-measure protocol where a sender encodes a random message into a shorter sequence and a receiver attempts to exclude a randomly chosen letter in the original message. We present quantum advantages in RECs in two ways: probability and dimension. We show that RECs with quantum resources achieve higher success probabilities than classical strategies. We verify that the quantum resources required to describe detection events of RECs have a smaller dimension than classical ones. We also show that a guessing counterpart, random access codes (RACs), may not have a dimension advantage over classical resources. Our results elucidate various possibilities of achieving quantum advantages in two-party communication.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum sampling on distributed databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sampling, a fundamental subroutine in numerous quantum algorithms, involves encoding a given probability distribution in the amplitudes of a pure state. Given the hefty cost of large-scale quantum storage, we initiate the study of quantum sampling in a distributed setting. Specifically, we assume that the data is distributed among multiple machines, and each machine solely maintains a basic oracle that counts the multiplicity of individual elements. Given a quantum sampling task, which is to sample from the joint database, a coordinator can make oracle queries to all machines. We focus on the oblivious communication model, where communications between the coordinator and the machines are predetermined. We present both sequential and parallel algorithms: the sequential algorithm queries the machines sequentially, while the parallel algorithm allows the coordinator to query all machines simultaneously. Furthermore, we prove that both algorithms are optimal in their respective settings.</description>

      <title>Detection and manipulation of surface electric field noise of hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spin defects off er transformative potential for quantum sensing through atomic-scale proximity to target samples, yet their performance is fundamentally limited by rapid coherence loss. While magnetic noise mechanisms have been extensively studied, another critical infl uence from surface electric fi eld noise remains unexplored in hBN systems. Here,we address this challenge and systematically investigate surface electric fi eld noise in hBN using shallow boron vacancy defects. The double-quantum spin relaxation behavior in response to magnetic fi elds and defect depths is examined, revealing that the relaxation rate follows a distinctive depth-related power-law dependence of ODMR splitting frequency. The relaxation is also demonstrated to be independent of the defect concentrations. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate is investigated, showing a noticeable rise as the temperature increases from 296 K to 453 K, thus highlighting the infl uence of thermal eff ects on spin relaxation. To further suppress surface electric fi eld noise, we explore the eff ectiveness of passivation materials, including glycerol and PMMA. Notably, PMMA is more effi cient in mitigating surface electric fi eld noise. These experiments enhance the understanding of surface electric fi eld noise in hBN and provide a foundation for developing noise mitigation strategies in future research.</description>

      <title>High Impedance Granular Aluminum Ring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting inductors with impedance surpassing the resistance quantum, i.e., superinductors, are important for quantum technologies because they enable the development of protected qubits, enhance coupling to systems with small electric dipole moments, and facilitate the study of phase-slip physics. We demonstrate superinductors with densely packed meandered traces of granular aluminum (grAl) with inductances up to $4\,\mu\mathrm{H}$, achieving impedances exceeding $100\,\mathrm{k}\Omega$ in the $4-8\,\mathrm{GHz}$ range. Ring resonators made with grAl meandered superinductors exhibit quality factors on the order of $10^5$ in the single-photon regime and low non-linearity on the order of tens of $\mathrm{Hz}$. Depending on the grAl resistivity, at $10\,\mathrm{Hz}$, we measure frequency noise spectral densities in the range of $10^2$ to $10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. In some devices, in the single-photon regime, we observe a positive Kerr coefficient of unknown origin. Using more complex fabrication, the devices could be released from the substrate, either freestanding or suspended on a membrane, thereby further improving their impedance by a factor of three.</description>

      <title>Universal phase correction for quantum state transfer in one-dimensional topological spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gap-protected topological channels are a promising way to realize robust and high-fidelity state transfer in quantum networks. Although various topological transfer protocols based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model or its variants have been proposed, the phase accumulation during the evolution, as an essential aspect, is underestimated. Here, by numerically studying the phase information of quantum state transfer (QST) in one-dimensional (1D) topological spin chains, we uncover a universal phase correction $\phi_0 =(N-1)\pi/2$ for both adiabatic and diabatic topological schemes. Interestingly, the site-number-dependent phase correction satisfies $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ symmetry and is equally effective for perfect mirror transmission in spin chains. Our work reveals a universal phase correction in 1D topologically protected QST, which will prompt a reevaluation of the topological protection mechanism in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental Test of the Principle of Tomographic Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle of tomographic locality states that the operational state of a multipartite system can be fully characterized by the statistics obtained from measurements that are local to the individual subsystems. This property holds in quantum theory and features prominently in axiomatic reconstructions of the theory, where it serves to rule out a wide class of alternatives. For instance, quantum theory with Hilbert spaces defined over the real field (rather than the complex field) is an example of a theory that is ruled out in this fashion. Given its foundational importance, it is worthwhile to subject this principle to a direct experimental test. Specifically, we consider an experiment on the polarization degrees of freedom of a pair of photonic modes in a prepare-and-measure scenario and analyze the resulting data within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. The signature of a failure of tomographic locality is that there are pairs of states on the bipartite system that can only be distinguished by the statistics they yield for non-separable measurements. In the full quantum setting, we find no evidence of a violation of tomographic locality. As a test of our analysis method, we also verify that if we restrict attention to those states and measurements that lie within the fragment described by quantum theory over the real field, then a clear signature of the failure of tomographic locality is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a method for tuning a dissipation rate in an atom-cavity system. By inserting a nanotip into the cavity mode, we estimate that the cavity dissipation rate increases by a factor of approximately 20, due to the scattering loss at the tip. As applications of our in-situ technique, we demonstrate that an exceptional line can be obtained when a single atom or ion is coupled to the resonator. Moreover, the position of an exceptional point is tuned by adjusting the decay rate, enabling a topological transition through dissipation control alone.</description>

      <title>A weighted quantum ensemble of homogeneous quantum classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble methods in machine learning aim to improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple models. This is achieved by ensuring diversity among predictors to capture different data aspects. Homogeneous ensembles use identical models, achieving diversity through different data subsets, and weighted-average ensembles assign higher influence to more accurate models through a weight learning procedure. We propose a method to achieve a weighted homogeneous quantum ensemble using quantum classifiers with indexing registers for data encoding. This approach leverages instance-based quantum classifiers, enabling feature and training point subsampling through superposition and controlled unitaries, and allowing for a quantum-parallel execution of diverse internal classifiers with different data compositions in superposition. The method integrates a learning process involving circuit execution and classical weight optimization, for a trained ensemble execution with weights encoded in the circuit at test-time. Empirical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, offering insights into its performance.</description>

      <title>Clock Synchronization for Drone-Based Entanglement Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drone-based entanglement distribution provides full spatiotemporal coverage for quantum networks, enabling quantum key distribution (QKD) in dynamic environments. The security of QKD fundamentally depends on high-fidelity quantum state measurements, for which high-precision clock synchronization is indispensable, as timing jitter is inversely correlated with quantum state fidelity. However, drone-based clock synchronization is constrained by SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) limitations and dynamic mobility effects. Here, we propose a synchronization protocol for drone-based entanglement distribution, leveraging nanosecond-accurate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) timing and entanglement-based timing correction to overcome SWaP constraints. Experimental results demonstrate 24 ps RMS synchronization in simulated free-space quantum channels with distance dynamics, without requiring precision reference clock. Our protocol enables drone-based entanglement distribution, paving the way for seamless wide-area and local-area quantum internet.</description>

Abstract: Cubic-phase states are a sufficient resource for universal quantum computing over continuous variables. We present results from numerical experiments in which deep neural networks are trained via reinforcement learning to control a quantum optical circuit for generating cubic-phase states, with an average success rate of 96%. The only non-Gaussian resource required is photon-number-resolving measurements. We also show that the exact same resources enable the direct generation of a quartic-phase gate, with no need for a cubic gate decomposition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm, implemented on IonQ's fully connected trapped-ion quantum processors, offers an efficient approach to solving dense higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. Specifically, we tackle protein folding on a tetrahedral lattice for up to 12 amino acids, representing the largest quantum hardware implementations of protein folding problems reported to date. Additionally, we address MAX 4-SAT instances at the computational phase transition and fully connected spin-glass problems using all 36 available qubits. Across all considered cases, our method consistently achieves optimal solutions, highlighting the powerful synergy between non-variational quantum optimization approaches and the intrinsic all-to-all connectivity of trapped-ion architectures. Given the expected scalability of trapped-ion quantum systems, BF-DCQO represents a promising pathway toward practical quantum advantage for dense HUBO problems with significant industrial and scientific relevance.</description>

      <title>Entropic Dynamics approach to Relational Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general framework of Entropic Dynamics (ED) is used to construct non-relativistic models of relational quantum mechanics from well known inference principles -- probability, entropy and information geometry. Although only partially relational -- the absolute structures of simultaneity and Euclidean geometry are still retained -- these models provide a useful testing ground for ideas that will prove useful in the context of more realistic relativistic theories. The fact that in ED the positions of particles have definite values, just as in classical mechanics, has allowed us to adapt to the quantum case some intuitions from Barbour and Bertotti's classical framework. Here, however, we propose a new measure of the mismatch between successive states that is adapted to the information metric and the symplectic structures of the quantum phase space. We make explicit that ED is temporally relational and we construct non-relativistic quantum models that are spatially relational with respect to rigid translations and rotations. The ED approach settles the longstanding question of what form should the constraints of a classical theory take after quantization: the quantum constraints that express relationality are to be imposed on expectation values. To highlight the potential impact of these developments, the non-relativistic quantum model is parametrized into a generally covariant form and we show that the ED approach evades the analogue of what in quantum gravity has been called the problem of time.</description>

      <title>Stark Tuning and Charge State Control in Individual Telecom C-Band Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telecom-wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single-photons compatible with existing fiber-optic infrastructure. Emission in the low-loss C-band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we present the first demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in a InP-based $n^{++}$--$i$--$n^{+}$ heterostructure, fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine-structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single-photon character is confirmed via second-order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber-compatible quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic collapse model for distinguishable particles is presented. Position and time, for each particle, are the fundamental operators of the theory. The Schr\"odinger equation is of the CSL form, with a Hermitian Hamiltonian and an anti-Hermitian, white-noise dependent, Hamiltonian. It generates state vector evolution parametrised by an "evolution parameter". It is shown how this can be interpreted as an evolving state in spacetime with collapses satisfying Born rule probabilities, and how certain choices of collapse generating operators lead to states of definite mass and definite configuration in spacetime. The model is Poincar\'e covariant and conserves energy in expectation.</description>

      <title>High resolution quantum enhanced phase imaging of cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering both amplitude and phase information from a system is a fundamental goal of optical imaging. At the same time, it is crucial to use a low photon dose to avoid altering the system, particularly when dealing with biological samples. Quantum imaging offers a powerful approach for extracting more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction and spatial resolution has been considered a major drawback to the application of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they could offer the most significant benefits. In this work, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating a resolution-independent quantum advantage. We achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture, while simultaneously attaining quantum noise reduction. This enables, for the first time, sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells. Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a quasi-single-shot wide-field mode, retrieves both phase and amplitude information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it intrinsically fast and stable. These results pave the way for the immediate application of sub-shot-noise imaging in biology.</description>

      <title>Orbit dimensions in linear and Gaussian quantum optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sub-universal quantum platforms such as linear or Gaussian quantum optics, quantum states can behave as different resources, in regard to the extent of their accessible state space (called their orbit) under the action of the restricted unitary group. We propose to study the dimension of a quantum state's orbit (as a manifold in the Hilbert space), a simple yet nontrivial topological property that can quantify "how many" states it can reach. As natural invariants under the group, these structural properties of orbits alone can reveal fundamental impossibilities of enacting certain unitary transformations deterministically. We showcase a general and straightforward way to compute orbit dimensions for states of finite support in the Fock basis, by leveraging the group's Lie algebra. We also study genericity and robustness properties of orbit dimensions, and propose approaches to efficiently evaluate them experimentally. Besides, we highlight that the orbit dimension under the Gaussian unitary group serves a non-Gaussianity witness, which we expect to be universal for multimode pure states. While proven in the discrete variable setting (i.e. passive linear optics with an energy cutoff), the validity of our work in the continuous variable setting does rest on a technical conjecture which we do not prove.</description>

      <title>Tilt-Induced Localization in Interacting Bose-Einstein Condensates for Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate localization transitions in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in tilted optical lattices, focusing on both the continuum limit accessed via shallow lattice depths and the tight-binding limit realized in the deep lattice regime. Utilizing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the many-body Bose-Hubbard model, we analyze the scaling behavior of localization indicators, such as the root mean square width and fidelity susceptibility, as a function of the applied tilt. Our results reveal clear signatures of a localization-delocalization transition driven by the linear potential, with scaling properties that characterize criticality even in the presence of interactions within the GPE description. Despite the single-mode nature of the condensate wavefunction, we demonstrate that it can effectively probe quantum criticality. Building on this, we propose the use of interacting BECs in tilted lattices as a platform for quantum critical sensing, where the condensate wavefunction serves both as a sensitive probe of localization and a practical resource for quantum-enhanced metrology. This approach opens new avenues for precision gradient sensing based on localization phenomena in bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Angular $k$-uniformity and the Hyperinvariance of Holographic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic quantum error-correcting codes, often realized through tensor network architectures, have emerged as compelling toy models for exploring bulk-boundary duality in AdS-CFT. By encoding bulk information into highly entangled boundary degrees of freedom, they capture key features of holography such as subregion duality, operator reconstruction, and complementary recovery. Among them, hyperinvariant tensor networks-characterized by the inclusion of edge tensors and the enforcement of multi-tensor isometries-offer a promising platform for realizing features such as state dependence and nontrivial boundary correlations. However, existing constructions are largely confined to two-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying hyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To address this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity, which refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring isometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric layout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction of hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in arbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO architectures beyond regular tilings. Altogether, angular k-uniformity provides a versatile, geometry-aware framework for analyzing and designing holographic tensor networks and codes with hyperinvariant features such as nontrivial boundary correlations and state-dependent complementary recovery.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference in Two-Atom Resonant X-ray Scattering of an Intense Attosecond Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</description>

      <title>Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in quantum systems with few degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Skewness of von Neumann entropy over Bures-Hall random states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the degree of entanglement, as measured by von Neumann entropy, of bipartite systems over the Bures-Hall ensemble. Closed-form expressions of the first two cumulants of von Neumann entropy over the ensemble have been recently derived in the literature. In this paper, we focus on its skewness by calculating the third cumulant that describes the degree of asymmetry of the distribution. The main result is an exact closed-form formula of the third cumulant, which leads to a more accurate approximation to the distribution of von Neumann entropy. The key to obtaining the result lies on finding a dozen of new summation identities in simplifying a large number of finite summations involving polygamma functions.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard Model on a Honeycomb Superlattice: Quantum Phase Transitions and Lattice Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model on a honeycomb superlattice. The interplay between the superlattice potential depth $\Delta/t$ and the onsite interaction $U/t$ gives rise to three distinct quantum phases at zero temperature: a superfluid phase, a Mott insulator I phase with unit filling on each site, and a Mott insulator II phase characterized by density imbalance-double occupancy on one sublattice and vacancy on the other at unit filling. The SF-MI transitions are found to be continuous, consistent with second-order quantum phase transitions. We further extend our analysis to finite temperatures within the superfluid regime. Our work highlights how a honeycomb superlattice geometry enables access to interaction- and lattice-modulation-driven quantum phases, including a density-imbalanced Mott insulator and a robust superfluid regime, offering concrete theoretical predictions for cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic Study of Temperature: Quantum Circuitry in Thermal Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical thermodynamic singularities at phase transitions and in negative-temperature regimes arise because the equal-a-priori probability postulate overlooks the quantum dynamical complexity required to prepare microstates. We promote bounded dynamical complexity to a postulate and develop Complexity Windowed Thermodynamics (CWT). Introducing a finite complexity budget yields the windowed entropy, an entropy of ignorance that is smooth in energy and monotonically non-increasing in the budget. Smoothness guarantees a finite, continuous effective temperature and a non-negative complexity generation potential, thereby regularizing all classical singularities while recovering standard statistical mechanics as the complexity budget approaches infinity. CWT's generalized first law unveils an information processing work term. From unitary channel geometry we derive universal bounds on action and time: the action consumed must be proportional to the optimal circuit complexity, while the minimum required time is inversely proportional to the effective temperature. The framework unifies phenomena from critical point smoothing to black hole information flow, and predicts that the universe's total generatable complexity and its holographic entropy are of the same order bridging thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Geometric Shifts in Wave Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Berry's pioneering 1984 work, the separation of geometric and dynamic contributions in the phase of an evolving wave has become fundamental in wave physics, underpinning diverse phenomena in quantum mechanics, optics, and condensed matter. Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in their expectation values between the input and output wave sates. We describe this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry and dynamics in wave scattering and can be readily applied to a broad range of physical systems.</description>

Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, with a sudden position-dependent change (a quench) in the effective dispersion relation, have been proposed by Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al as an analogue spacetime test of the Unruh effect. We provide new support for this analogue by analysing the entanglement of a scalar field in a (1 + 1)-dimensional continuum spacetime with a similar quench, and the harvesting of this entanglement by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We present numerical evidence that the concurrence and mutual information harvested by the detectors are qualitatively similar to those in Rindler spacetime, but they exhibit a small yet noticeable variation when the energy pulse created by the quench crosses the detectors. These findings provide further motivation to implement the experimental proposal of Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al.</description>

Abstract: We establish a direct connection between spread complexity and quantum circuit complexity by demonstrating that spread complexity emerges as a limiting case of a circuit complexity framework built from two fundamental operations: time-evolution and superposition. Our approach leverages a computational setup where unitary gates and beam-splitting operations generate target states, with the minimal cost of synthesis yielding a complexity measure that converges to spread complexity in the infinitesimal time-evolution limit. This perspective not only provides a physical interpretation of spread complexity but also offers computational advantages, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods like the Lanczos algorithm fail. We illustrate our framework with an explicit SU(2) example and discuss broader applications, including cases where return amplitudes are non-perturbative or divergent</description>

Abstract: We derive Klein-Gordon equation and Schr\"odinger equation on curved manifolds embedded in high-dimensional manifolds to describe the motion of constrained spineless particles. We start from the equations on the main manifold and obtain the effective equations on the submanifold by degenerate additional dimensions. A geometric induced potential appears in our results.We reviewed the previous works of others and our results are consistent in the special case they calculated,We focused on discussing our results under general conditions and obtained a connection between differential geometry and physics.Especially the influence of peripheral manifolds on submanifold physics is somewhat counterintuitive.We have analyzed several explicit examples, presenting an elucidation of the interactions between the submanifold and matter fields. In one specific case, our approach derived the mass term of scalar fields on a lower-dimensional manifold through purely geometric induction. This mass term coincides with that in Kaluza-Klein theory, yet was achieved without invoking any periodic compactification constraints.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates perfect state transfer in Grover walks, a model of discrete-time quantum walks. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of perfect state transfer on graphs belonging to an association scheme. Our focus includes specific association schemes, namely the Hamming and Johnson schemes. We characterize all graphs on the classes of Hamming and Johnson schemes that exhibit perfect state transfer. Furthermore, we study perfect state transfer on distance-regular graphs. We provide complete characterizations for exhibiting perfect state transfer on distance-regular graphs of diameter $2$ and diameter $3$, as well as integral distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.</description>

      <title>Open quantum battery in the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07568</link>

Abstract: We investigate the charging performance of a quantum battery (QB) coupled to a scalar field under the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole. It is shown that under Dirichlet boundary conditions, when the QB's energy level spacing is smaller than the charging amplitude, the black hole rotation enhances the charging performance at finite times, whereas in other parameter regimes, it degrades the charging performance. Notably, as the black hole approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates that the performance of QBs can probe critical properties of black holes. Additionally, regarding the energy flow in QB, it is further demonstrated that the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation suppresses the QB's capacity to extract this energy. Our findings not only advance the relativistic dissipation dynamics of QBs but also propose a novel method to detect black hole rotation and extremal-state transitions.</description>

      <title>Verification of Quantum Circuits through Barrier Certificates using a Scenario Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, various techniques have been explored for the verification of quantum circuits, including the use of barrier certificates, mathematical tools capable of demonstrating the correctness of such systems. These certificates ensure that, starting from initial states and applying the system's dynamics, the system will never reach undesired states. In this paper, we propose a methodology for synthesizing such certificates for quantum circuits using a scenario-based approach, for both finite and infinite time horizons. In addition, our approach can handle uncertainty in the initial states and in the system's dynamics. We present several case studies on quantum circuits, comparing the performance of different types of barrier certificate and analyzing which one is most suitable for each case.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses the relationships between the Fiedler vector, the Cheeger constant, and threshold behaviors in networks of quantum resource nodes represented as Quantum Directed Acyclic Graphs (QDAGs). We explore how these mathematical constructs can be applied to understand the dynamics of quantum information flow in QDAGs, especially in the context of routing problems with bottlenecks in graph signal processing, and how new eigenvalue-based rewiring techniques can optimize entanglement distribution between nodes in a QDAG.</description>

      <title>Quantum Graph Transformer for NLP Sentiment Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex, structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling. The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum control method for superconducting transmon qubits that substantially outperforms conventional techniques in precision and robustness against coherent errors. Our approach leverages composite pulses (CP) to effectively mitigate system-specific errors, such as qubit frequency and anharmonicity variations. By utilizing CP, we demonstrate both complete and partial population transfers between qubit states, as well as the implementation of two essential single-qubit quantum gates. Simulations reveal substantial reductions in common error rates and gate durations. The effectiveness of our method is validated through four independent verification techniques, underscoring its potential for advancing quantum computing with superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a protocol that effectively suppresses the qubit-bath interaction in diamond and enables detection of weak AC signals (below 1 MHz) with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to SNR = 17. The method is based on AC magnetometry with single- and double-dressed states that are adiabatically transferred from the initial qubit states using concatenated continuous dynamical decoupling. This work paves a way toward sensitive detection of weakly coupled nuclear spins in low-field NMR experiments.</description>

      <title>Certifying the activation of Bell nonlocality with finite data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The activation of Bell nonlocality is a protocol that enables the violation of a Bell inequality from a system that initially did not allow for any such violation because the state of the system was Bell-local. This activation of hidden Bell nonlocality has been demonstrated in experiments; however, while the certification of Bell nonlocality is conceptional straightforward, a statistically rigorous verification that the initial state is Bell-local has not yet been achieved. This is due to two key obstacles: The lack of a method to establish a suitable confidence region from the measured data and the need for an efficient technique to verify Bell locality of all states within the confidence region. In this work, we address both challenges. We introduce a confidence polytope in the form of a hyperoctahedron and provide a computationally efficient method to verify whether a quantum state admits a local hidden state model, thus being unsteerable and, consequently, Bell-local. Using these methods, we find that a statistically rigorous certification of hidden Bell nonlocality needs of the order of $10^9$ samples.</description>

Abstract: Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset a superconducting qubit to near its ground state, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a quantum computing approach to designing of similarity measures and kernels for classification of stochastic symbolic time series. In the area of machine learning, kernels are important components of various similarity-based classification, clustering, and regression algorithms. An effective strategy for devising problem-specific kernels is leveraging existing generative models of the example space. In this study we assume that a quantum generative model, known as quantum hidden Markov model (QHMM), describes the underlying distributions of the examples. The sequence structure and probability are determined by transitions within model's density operator space. Consequently, the QHMM defines a mapping from the example space into the broader quantum space of density operators. Sequence similarity is evaluated using divergence measures such as trace and Bures distances between quantum states. We conducted extensive simulations to explore the relationship between the distribution of kernel-estimated similarity and the dimensionality of the QHMMs Hilbert space. As anticipated, a higher dimension of the Hilbert space corresponds to greater sequence distances and a more distinct separation of the examples. To empirically evaluate the performance of the kernels, we defined classification tasks based on a simplified generative model of directional price movement in the stock market. We implemented two widely-used kernel-based algorithms - support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors - using both classical and quantum kernels. Across all classification task scenarios, the quantum kernels consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to their classical counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson sampling, a computational task believed to be classically hard to simulate, is expected to hold promise for demonstrating quantum computational advantage using near-term quantum devices. However, noise in experimental implementations poses a significant challenge, potentially rendering boson sampling classically simulable and compromising its classical intractability. Numerous studies have proposed classical algorithms under various noise models that can efficiently simulate boson sampling as noise rates increase with circuit depth. To address this issue particularly related to circuit depth, we explore the viability of achieving quantum computational advantage through boson sampling with shallow-depth linear optical circuits. Specifically, as the average-case hardness of estimating output probabilities of boson sampling is a crucial ingredient in demonstrating its classical intractability, we make progress on establishing the average-case hardness confined to logarithmic-depth regimes. We also obtain the average-case hardness for logarithmic-depth Fock-state boson sampling subject to lossy environments and for the logarithmic-depth Gaussian boson sampling. By providing complexity-theoretical backgrounds for the classical simulation hardness of logarithmic-depth boson sampling, we expect that our findings will mark a crucial step towards a more noise-tolerant demonstration of quantum advantage with shallow-depth boson sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextuality, one of the strongest forms of quantum correlations, delineates the quantum world and the classical one. It has been shown recently that some quantum models, in the form of infinite one-dimensional translation-invariant Hamiltonians with nearest- and next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions, have the lowest ground state energy density allowed in quantum physics. However, these models all have local Hilbert space dimension larger than two, making the study of their ground state behavior difficult on current qubit-based variational quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we focus on the cost of simulating the local approximations of ground states of these models using qubit-based parameterized quantum circuits. The local approximations, which are 3-site reduced density matrices with local Hilbert space dimension three, are purified then encoded into permutation-symmetric qubits. We develop a universal set of permutation-symmetry preserving qubit-based gates, using them as an ansatz to simulate parameterized quantum circuits designed for qutrits. These techniques allow us to assess the accuracy of simulating the purified local ground states with respect to a fixed amount of classical and quantum resources. We found that given the same quantum circuit and the number of iterations, more contextual ground states with lower energy density are easier to simulate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Casimir energy for $N$ $\delta$-function plates depends on the multiple scattering parameter $\Delta$. This $N$-body interaction was distributed into interactions with nearest neighbour scattering and next-to-nearest neighbour scattering based on partitions of $N-1$ and its permutations. Implementing this methodology, we investigate the Casimir interaction for multiple plates with constant conductivity relatable to Graphene. We also study the Casimir energy between a perfect magnetic conductor and multiple constant conductivity $\delta$ plates, which results in Boyer repulsion. In the asymptotic limit for ideal boundary conditions, the results become simple where the multiple scattering parameter $\Delta$ consists only of the nearest neighbour scattering term. Further, we used neural networks to analyze the Casimir energy in the Boyer repulsion configurations to understand the influence of pairwise energies on the many-body energy. The neural network could distinguish the repulsive and attractive forces depending on the regions of varying conductivity.</description>

For this purpose, we use two-mode sphere coherent state as the input beams of the aforementioned process. These states are realization of coherent states of two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, which lies on a two-dimension sphere. We calculate the entanglement of output states of stimulated parametric down conversion process, measured by linear entropy, and show that it depends on the spatial curvature. So, by preparing the suitable two-mode sphere coherent states, it is possible to control the entanglement between the output states in the laboratory. In addition, we consider mean number and Mandel parameter of the output states of the process and also, their cross-correlation function, as the convince measures of non-classical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Wigner's friend scenarios: on what to condition and how to verify the predictions</title>

Abstract: Wigner's friend experiment and its modern extensions display the ambiguity of the quantum mechanical description regarding the assignment of quantum states. While the friend applies the state-update rule to the system upon observing an outcome of her measurement in a quantum system, Wigner describes the friend's measurement as a unitary evolution, resulting in an entangled state for the composite system of the friend and the system. In this respect, Wigner is often referred to as a "superobserver" who has the supreme technological ability to keep the friend's laboratory coherent. As such, it is often argued that he has the "correct" description of the state. Here we show that the situation is more symmetrical than is usually thought: there are different types of information that each of the observers has that the other fundamentally cannot have - they reside in different "bubbles" (in Calvalcanti's terminology). While this can explain why the objectivity of the state assignment is only relative to the bubble, we consider more elaborated situations in the form of a game in which the players can switch between bubbles. We find that, in certain circumstances, observers may be entitled to adopt and verify the state assignment from another bubble if they condition their predictions on \textit{all} information that is in principle available to them.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum Realization of Jet Clustering in High-Energy Physics Experiments</title>

Abstract: Exploring the application of quantum technologies to fundamental sciences holds the key to fostering innovation for both sides. In high-energy particle collisions, quarks and gluons are produced and immediately form collimated particle sprays known as jets. Accurate jet clustering is crucial as it retains the information of the originating quark or gluon and forms the basis for studying properties of the Higgs boson, which underlies teh mechanism of mass generation for subatomic particles. For the first time, by mapping collision events into graphs--with particles as nodes and their angular separations as edges--we realize jet clustering using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for addressing classical combinatorial optimization problems with available quantum resources. Our results, derived from 30 qubits on quantum computer simulator and 6 qubits on quantum computer hardware, demonstrate that jet clustering performance with QAOA is comparable with or even better than classical algorithms for a small-sized problem. This study highlights the feasibility of quantum computing to revolutionize jet clustering, bringing the practical application of quantum computing in high-energy physics experiments one step closer.</description>

Abstract: Differential equations (DEs) serve as the cornerstone for a wide range of scientific endeavors, their solutions weaving through the core of diverse fields such as structural engineering, fluid dynamics, and financial modeling. DEs are notoriously hard to solve, due to their intricate nature, and finding solutions to DEs often exceeds the capabilities of traditional computational approaches. Recent advances in quantum computing have triggered a growing interest from researchers for the design of quantum algorithms for solving DEs. In this work, we introduce two different architectures of a novel variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with Lagrange polynomial encoding in combination with derivative quantum circuits using the Hadamard test differentiation to approximate the solution of DEs. To demonstrate the potential of our new VQA, two well-known ordinary differential equations are used: the damped mass-spring system from a given initial condition and the Poisson equation for periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the proposed new VQA has a reduced gate complexity compared to previous variational quantum algorithms, for a similar or better quality of the solution.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute to enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles that are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence, and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first-order, second-order, topological, and localization phase transitions, have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum-enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter that can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy splitting in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Typical Quantum States of the Universe are Observationally Indistinguishable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish three new impossibility results regarding our knowledge of the quantum state of the universe -- a central object in quantum theory. We show that, if the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector from a high-dimensional subspace H_0 of Hilbert space H (such as the one defined by a low-entropy macro-state as prescribed by the Past Hypothesis), then no observation can determine or just significantly narrow down which vector it is. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other (and from the density matrix of H_0). Moreover, we show that for any observation that isn't too unlikely and most pairs of unit vectors from H_0, the observation will not significantly favor one vector over the other. We further show that the uniform distribution over the unit sphere in H_0, after Bayesian updating in the light of any observation that isn't too unlikely, is still extremely close to uniform. Our arguments rely on a typicality theorem from quantum statistical mechanics. We also discuss how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.</description>

      <title>Sound certification of memory-bounded quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum hardware calls for the development of reliable methods to certify its correct functioning. However, existing certification tests often fall short: they either rely on flawless state preparation and measurement or lack soundness guarantees, meaning that they do not rule out incorrect implementations of the target operations by a quantum device. We introduce an approach, which we call quantum system quizzing, for the certification of quantum gates in a practical server-user scenario, where a classical user tests the results of quantum computations performed by a quantum server. Importantly, this approach does not require trusted state preparation and measurement and is thus inherently free from the associated systematic errors. For a wide range of relevant gate sets, including a universal one, we prove our certification protocol to be sound, i.e., it rejects any quantum model other than the targeted one, assuming a bound on the total memory of the quantum computer. A major technical challenge that we are first to resolve in the memory-bounded single-device setup is recovering the tensor product structure of a multi-qubit system. Our protocol is platform-agnostic, introducing a new paradigm for benchmarking diverse quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging and Metrology with Undetected squeezed Photons: Noise Canceling and Noise Based Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work a quantum imaging setup based on undetected squeezed photons is employed for metrological applications such as sensitive phase measurement and quantum imaging. In spite of the traditional quantum imaging with undetected photons, introduced by A. Zeilinger et. al, the proposed setup is equipped by a homodyne detection and also the brightness of the quantum light is enhanced by an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). Introducing OPO may be diminish the validity of the low gain approximation, so a theoretical approach beyond this approximation is introduced. Due to the resource of squeezing, the results reveal the higher amount of signal to noise ratio, as a measure of image quality and phase-measurement accuracy. Accordingly, an imaging protocol is introduced to suppress the background noises, effectively. Interestingly, This protocol provides a way to extract the image information which is encoded in the quantum fluctuation (noise). Therefore, non-disruptive imaging is achievable, which is noteworthy subject in the field of bio-imaging of sensitive and low damage threshold living cells.</description>

      <title>Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, for many applications, it is important to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.</description>

Abstract: One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard model is challenging, in part due to the exponentially large Hilbert space, which complicates efficiently finding a path from an initial state to the ground state using the variational principle. In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers have advanced rapidly in qubit count and gate fidelity. However, large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing still relies on quantum error correction code (QECC) to suppress noise. Manually or experimentally verifying the fault-tolerance property of complex QECC implementation is impractical due to the vast error combinations. This paper formalizes the fault-tolerance of QECC implementations within the language of quantum programs. By incorporating the techniques of quantum symbolic execution, we provide an automatic verification tool for quantum fault-tolerance. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool on a universal set of logical operations across different QECCs.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum phase transitions monitored by current fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions (DPT) are defined by sudden changes in the physical properties of nonequilibrium open quantum systems and they present characteristics that have no analogue in closed and thermal systems. Several methods to detect and characterize DPT have been suggested in the literature, the most famous of which -- the $\textit{Liouvillian gap}$ -- can be derived from a spectral analysis of the Liouvillian super-operator that governs the complex interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics. Here, we consider the $\textit{output current}$, defined as the average total quantum jumps per unit time between the open quantum system and the environment. We propose that output current fluctuations, and in particular their dynamical correlations, their power spectrum, and their characteristic timescale can provide valuable information about DPT, confirming a dramatic change of behavior at the critical point. We validate our proposal using the dissipative XYZ model and the nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr model, showing good agreement with previous estimates of the location of the critical point. Compared to previous approaches, our proposal could be already experimentally tested in optical systems, providing a practical method to detect criticality in quantum open systems.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Wave Function as a Complex Probability Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10523v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper suggests an interpretation for the wave function, based on some elements of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, the time-symmetric laws of quantum theory and complex probabilities. Our main purpose is to demonstrate that the wave function and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as complex probability densities (or quasi-probability distributions) related to non-real forward and backward in time stochastic motion respectively. Those two quasi-Brownian motions serve as mathematical abstracts in order to derive the Born rule using probability theory and the intersection of the two probability sets that describe each of those motions. This proposal is useful also for explaining more about the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics that produces this so-called "wave-like" nature of quantum reality. Our perspective also challenges the notion of physical superposition which is a fundamental concept in the Copenhagen interpretation and some other interpretations of quantum theory. Moreover, it is suggested that, embracing the idea of stochastic processes in quantum theory, may explain the reasons for the appearance of classical behavior in large objects, in contrast to the quantum behavior of small ones. In other words, we claim that a combination of a probabilistic and no-ontic view of the wave function with a stochastic hidden-variables approach, like Nelson's and others', may provide some insight into the quantum physical reality and potentially establish the groundwork for a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Clustering-Based Sub-QUBO Extraction for Hybrid QUBO Solvers</title>

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) can be used to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. However, the size of the solvable problem is limited by the number of qubits. To leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to solve large-scale QUBO problems, one possible way is to decompose the full problem into multiple sub-problems, which we refer to as the Sub-QUBO Formalism. In this work, we enhance this formalism by proposing a sub-QUBO extraction protocol. To do so, we define a measure to quantify correlations between variables and use it to build a correlation matrix. This matrix serves as the input for clustering algorithms to group variables. Variables belonging to the same group form sub-QUBOs and are subsequently solved using QAOA. Our numerical analysis on several classes of randomly generated QUBO problems demonstrates that this grouping method outperforms previous approaches in terms of objective function values, while maintaining a comparable number of quantum subroutine calls. This method offers wide applicability for solving QUBO problems on NISQ devices.</description>

Abstract: Solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Recent advancements in quantum hardware have opened new avenues for addressing this challenge. Inspired by the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) algorithm [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], which was originally designed for sampling the Boltzmann distribution of classical spin models using quantum computers, we introduce a quantum-assisted variational Monte Carlo (QA-VMC) algorithm for solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems by adapting QeMCMC to sample the distribution of a (neural-network) wave function in VMC. The central question is whether such quantum-assisted proposal can potentially offer a computational advantage over classical methods. Through numerical investigations for the Fermi-Hubbard model and molecular systems, we demonstrate that the quantum-assisted proposal exhibits larger absolute spectral gaps and reduced autocorrelation times compared to conventional classical proposals, leading to more efficient sampling and faster convergence to the ground state in VMC as well as more accurate and precise estimation of physical observables. This advantage is especially pronounced for specific parameter ranges, where the ground-state configurations are more concentrated in some configurations separated by large Hamming distances. Our results underscore the potential of quantum-assisted algorithms to enhance classical variational methods for solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum sensing in time-modulated non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing the sensitivity of quantum sensing near an exceptional point represents a significant phenomenon in non-Hermitian (NH) systems. However, the application of this property in time-modulated NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose two theoretical schemes to achieve enhanced quantum sensing in time-modulated NH systems by leveraging the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenstates. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the full energy spectrum, including both real and imaginary components, the population distribution of eigenstates, and various characteristics associated with optimal conditions for sensitivity enhancement. Numerical simulations confirm that eigenvalue-based quantum sensors exhibit a 9.21-fold improvement compared to conventional Hermitian sensors, aligning with the performance of existing time-independent NH sensors. Conversely, for eigenstate-based quantum sensors, the enhancement reaches up to 50 times that of conventional Hermitian sensors, surpassing the results of existing time-independent NH sensors. Moreover, the eigenstate-based sensor exhibits divergent susceptibility even when not close to an exceptional point. Our findings pave the way for advanced sensing in time-sensitive contexts, thereby complementing existing efforts aimed at harnessing the unique properties of open systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Non-Abelian Quantum Signal Processing: Efficient Control of Hybrid Continuous- and Discrete-Variable Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust quantum control is crucial for achieving operations below the quantum error correction threshold. Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) transforms a unitary parameterized by $\theta$ into one governed by a polynomial function $f(\theta)$, a feature that underpins key quantum algorithms. Originating from composite pulse techniques in NMR, QSP enhances robustness against systematic control errors. We extend QSP to a new class, non-abelian QSP, which utilizes non-commuting control parameters, $\hat\theta_1, \hat\theta_2, \dots$, representing quantum harmonic oscillator positions and momenta. We introduce a fundamental non-abelian composite pulse sequence, the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation (GCR), for entangling and disentangling a qubit from an oscillator. This sequence achieves at least a $4.5\times$ speedup compared to the state-of-the-art abelian QSP pulse BB1, while maintaining performance. Though quantum fluctuations in the control parameters are unavoidable, the richer commutator algebra of non-abelian QSP enhances its power and efficiency. Non-abelian QSP represents the highest tier of QSP variants tailored for hybrid oscillator-qubit architectures, unlocking new possibilities for such systems. We demonstrate the utility of GCR in high-fidelity preparation of continuous-variable oscillator states, including squeezed, Fock, cat, and GKP states, using fully analytical schemes that match numerically optimized methods in fidelity and depth while enabling mid-circuit error detection. Furthermore, we propose a high-fidelity QSP-based end-of-the-line GKP readout and a measurement-free, error-corrected gate teleportation protocol for logical operations on GKP bosonic qudits, bridging the gap between idealized theoretical and experimentally realistic versions of the GKP code. Finally, we showcase a GCR-based phase estimation algorithm for oscillator-based quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: With resonances treated as eigenstates of a non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonian, the task of localization of the complex energy eigenvalues is considered. The paper is devoted to the reduced version of this task in which one only computes the real quantities called singular values. It is shown that in such an approach (and under suitable constraints including the tridiagonality of the Hamiltdonian) the singular values can be sought as poles of an auxiliary Green's function expressible in terms of a doublet of matrix continued fractions. A family of multi-bosonic Bose-Hubbard-like complex Hamiltonians is recalled for illustration purposes.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum noise deconvolution with partial knowledge of noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new quantum noise deconvolution technique that does not rely on the complete knowledge of noise and does not require partial noise tomography. In this new method, we construct a set of observables with completely correctable expectation values despite our incomplete knowledge of noise. This task is achieved just by classical post-processing without extra quantum resources. We show that the number of parameters in the subset of observables with correctable expectation values is the same for all unitary quantum channels. For random unitary channels and the assumption that the probability distribution of unitary errors is unknown, we instruct the construction of the set of observables with correctable expectation values. For a particular case where the random unitary channel is made of just two random unitary operators acting on $d$-dimensional Hilbert-space, we show that the observable with correctable expectation value belongs to a set with at least $d$ parameters. We extend our method by considering observables for which the partial recovery of the expectation value is possible, at the cost of having partial knowledge about the noise-free initial state.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the entanglement barrier with sampled tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of entanglement under unitary time evolution is the primary bottleneck for modern tensor-network techniques--such as Matrix Product States (MPS)--when computing time-dependent expectation values. This {entanglement barrier} restricts classical simulations and, conversely, underpins the quantum advantage anticipated from future devices. Here we show that, for one-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the spatio-temporal tensor network encoding the evolved wave function amplitudes can be contracted efficiently along the left-right (spatial) direction. Exploiting this structure, we develop a hybrid Tensor-Network/Monte-Carlo (TN-MC) algorithm that samples the wave function and evaluates expectation values of generic local operators with computational cost that scales only polynomially in time. The accurate contraction of the wave function amplitudes is a consequence of the favorable scaling with time of the generalised temporal entropies. We find that their real part either saturates or, at most, grows logarithmically with time, revealing new instances of continuous dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) which we characterize. Our results therefore show that, when computing expectation values of local operators, the entanglement barrier in one-dimensional Hamiltonian evolution can be bypassed with a TN-MC blend.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variational quantum power method (VQPM), which adapts the classical power iteration algorithm for quantum settings, has shown promise for eigenvector estimation and optimization on quantum hardware. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis of VQPM by investigating its convergence, robustness, and qubit locking mechanisms. We present detailed strategies for applying VQPM to QUBO problems by leveraging these locking mechanisms. Based on the simulations for each strategy we have carried out, we give systematic guidelines for their practical applications. We also offer a numerical comparison with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) by running both algorithms on a set of trial problems. Our results indicate that VQPM can be employed as an effective quantum optimization algorithm on quantum computers for QUBO problems, and this work can serve as an initial guideline for such applications.</description>

      <title>Maximum Separation of Quantum Communication Complexity With and Without Shared Entanglement</title>

Abstract: We present relation problems whose input size is $n$ such that they can be solved with no communication for entanglement-assisted quantum communication models, but require $\Omega(n)$ qubit communication for $2$-way quantum communication models without prior shared entanglement. This is the maximum separation of quantum communication complexity with and without shared entanglement. To our knowledge, our result even shows the first lower bound on quantum communication complexity without shared entanglement when the upper bound of entanglement-assisted quantum communication models is zero. The problem we consider is parallel repetition of any non-local game which has a perfect quantum strategy and no perfect classical strategy, and for which a parallel repetition theorem holds with exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of photonic spin Hall effect in the Rydberg atomic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum guessing games offer a structured approach to analyzing quantum information processing, where information is encoded in quantum states and extracted through measurement. An additional aspect of this framework is the influence of partial knowledge about the input on the optimal measurement strategies. This kind of side information can significantly influence the guessing strategy and earlier work has shown that the timing of such side information, whether revealed before or after the measurement, can affect the success probabilities. In this work, we go beyond this established distinction by introducing the concept of metainformation. Metainformation is information about information, and in our context it is knowledge that additional side information of certain type will become later available, even if it is not yet provided. We show that this seemingly subtle difference between having no expectation of further information versus knowing it will arrive can have operational consequences for the guessing task. Our results demonstrate that metainformation can, in certain scenarios, enhance the achievable success probability up to the point that post-measurement side information becomes as useful as prior-measurement side information, while in others it offers no benefit. By formally distinguishing metainformation from actual side information, we uncover a finer structure in the interplay between timing, information, and strategy, offering new insights into the capabilities of quantum systems in information processing tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.05318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete time crystal (DTC) is a remarkable non-equilibrium phase of matter characterized by the persistent sub-harmonic oscillations of physical observables in periodically driven many-body systems. Motivated by the question of whether such a temporal periodic order can persist when the drive becomes aperiodic, we investigate the dynamics of a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model under quasiperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driving. Intriguingly, this infinite-range-interacting spin system can host ``quasi-discrete time crystal" (quasi-DTC) phases characterized by periodic oscillations of the magnetization. We demonstrate that our model can host the quasi-DTC analog of both period-doubling DTCs as well as higher-order DTCs. These quasi-DTCs are robust to various perturbations, and they originate from the interplay of ``all-to-all" interactions and the recursive structure of the TM sequence. Our results suggest that quasi-periodic driving protocols can provide a promising route for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book concerns the metasemantics of quantum mechanics (QM). Roughly, it pursues an investigation at the intersection of philosophy of physics and philosophy of language, and it offers a critical analysis of rival explanations of the semantic facts of standard QM. Two problems for such explanations are discussed: categoricity and permanence. New results include 1) a reconstruction of Einstein's incompleteness argument, which concludes that a local, separable, and categorical QM cannot exist, 2) a reinterpretation of Bohr's principle of correspondence, grounded in the principle of permanence, 3) a meaning-variance argument for quantum logic, which follows a line of critical reflections initiated by Weyl, and 4) an argument for semantic indeterminacy leveled against inferentialism about QM, inspired by Carnap's work in the philosophy of classical logic.</description>

      <title>Spatial super-resolution in nanosensing with blinking emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method of spatial resolution enhancement in metrology (thermometry, magnetometry, pH estimation, and similar methods) with blinking fluorescent nanosensors by combining sensing with super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). To demonstrate efficiency of this approach, both numerical simulations and a model experiment with laser diodes, which model fluctuating nanoemitters, and intentional blurring of the image are performed. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order cumulant images provide improvement of the contrast and enable successful reconstruction of smaller features of the modeled temperature (or any other physical parameter) distribution relatively to the intensity-based approach. We believe that blinking fluorescent sensing agents being complemented with the developed image analysis technique could be utilized routinely in the life science sector for recognizing the local changes in the spectral response of blinking fluorophores, e.g. delivered targetly to the wanted cell or even organelle. It is extremely useful for the local measurements of living cells' physical parameters changes due to applying any external "forces", including disease effect, aging, healing, or response to the treatment.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Higher-Order Non-Hermitian Skin and Boundary Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous imaging of vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-induced molecular dynamics often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Since the ensuing electronic and nuclear motion determines the pathways and outcomes of photoinduced reactions, our ability to monitor and understand these dynamics is crucial for molecular physics, physical chemistry, and photobiology. However, characterizing this complex motion represents a significant challenge when different degrees of freedom are strongly coupled. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) and quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map the bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the consequences of nuclear motion for the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. Our results demonstrate that multi-coincident CEI can be an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic driving of particles can create crystalline structures in their dynamics. Such systems can be used to study solid-state physics phenomena in the time domain. In addition, it is possible to realize photonic time crystals and to engineer the wave-number band structure of optical devices by periodic temporal modulation of the properties of light-propagating media. Here we introduce a versatile approach which uses traveling wave resonators to emulate various condensed matter phases in the time dimension. This is achieved by utilizing temporal modulation of the permittivity and the shape of small segments of the resonators. The required frequency and depth of the modulation are experimentally achievable which opens a pathway for the practical realisation of crystalline structures in time in microwave and in optical systems.</description>

      <title>On the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians is of inverse-square type. The result covers general graphs embedded in $\mathbb R^D$ and general finite-range interactions without requiring assumptions about the ground state correlations. Therefore, the inverse-square critical gap scaling is a robust, universal property of finite-range frustration-free Hamiltonians. This places further limits on their ability to produce conformal field theories in the continuum limit. Our proof refines the divide-and-conquer strategy of Kastoryano and the second author through the refined Detectability Lemma of Gosset--Huang.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation of QCD Jets on the Light Front</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon jets provide one of the best ways to probe the matter produced in ultrarelativistic high-energy collisions, from cold nuclear matter to hot quark-gluon plasma. In this work, we propose a unified framework for efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics using the (3+1)-dimensional QCD Hamiltonian on the light front, particularly suited for studying the scattering of quark and gluon jets on nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions. We describe scalable methods for mapping physical degrees of freedom onto qubits and for simulating in-medium jet evolution. We then validate our framework by implementing an algorithm that directly maps second-quantized Fock states onto qubits and uses Trotterized simulation for simulating time dynamics. Using a classical emulator, we investigate the evolution of quark and gluon jets with up to three particles in Fock states, extending prior studies. These calculations enable the study of key observables, including jet momentum broadening, particle production, and parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Integrability versus chaos in the steady state of many-body open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing eigensolver as a NISQ era tool for probing strong correlation effects in quantum chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is arguably the most popular noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era approach to quantum chemistry. We consider the underexplored quantum annealing eigensolver (QAE) algorithm as a worthy alternative. We use a combination of numerical calculations for a system where strong correlation effects dominate, and conclusions drawn from our preliminary scaling analysis for QAE and VQE to make the case for QAE as a NISQ era contender to VQE for quantum chemistry. For the former, we pick the representative example of computing avoided crossings in the H4 molecule in a rectangular geometry, and demonstrate that we obtain results to within about 1.2% of the full configuration interaction value on the D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Following our numerical results, we carry out a detailed yet preliminary analysis of the scaling behaviours of both the QAE and the VQE algorithms to assess the competency of the former for NISQ era chemistry.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factor and energy correlations in banded random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Banded random matrices were introduced as a more realistic alternative to full random matrices for describing the spectral statistics of heavy nuclei. Initially considered by Wigner, they have since become a paradigmatic model for investigating level statistics and the localization-delocalization transition in disordered quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that, despite the absence of short-range energy correlations, weak long-range energy correlations persist in the nonergodic phase of banded random matrices. This result is supported by our numerical and analytical studies of quantities that probe both short- and long-range energy correlations, namely, the spectral form factor, level number variance, and power spectrum. We derive the timescales for the onset of spectral correlations (ramp) and for the saturation (plateau) of the spectral form factor. Unexpectedly, we find that in the nonergodic phase, these timescales decrease as the bandwidth of the matrices is reduced. We also show that the high-frequency behavior of the power spectrum of energy fluctuations can distinguish between the nonergodic and ergodic phases of the banded random matrices.</description>

      <title>Observation of slow relaxation due to Hilbert space fragmentation in strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While isolated quantum systems generally thermalize after long-time evolution, there are several exceptions defying thermalization. A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide an experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</description>

      <title>The impact of hole $g$-factor anisotropy on spin-photon entanglement generation with InGaAs quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

Abstract: The characterization of ensembles of many-qubit random states and their realization via quantum circuits are crucial tasks in quantum-information theory. In this work, we study the ensembles generated by quantum circuits that randomly permute the computational basis, thus acting classically on the corresponding states. We focus on the averaged entanglement and present two main results. First, we derive generically tight upper bounds on the entanglement that can be generated by applying permutation circuits to arbitrary initial states. We show that the late-time ``entanglement Page curves'' are bounded in terms of the initial state participation entropies and its overlap with the ``maximally antilocalized'' state. Second, comparing the averaged R\'enyi-$2$ entropies generated by $(i)$ an infinitely deep random circuit of two-qubit gates and $(ii)$ global random permutations, we show that the two quantities are different for finite $N$ but the corresponding Page curves coincide in the thermodynamic limit. We also discuss how these conclusions are modified by additional random phases or considering circuits of $k$-local gates with $k\geq 3$. Our results are exact and highlight the implications of classical features on entanglement generation in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, could be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which are to be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Q-Policy: Quantum-Enhanced Policy Evaluation for Scalable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Q-Policy, a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework that mathematically accelerates policy evaluation and optimization by exploiting quantum computing primitives. Q-Policy encodes value functions in quantum superposition, enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiple state-action pairs via amplitude encoding and quantum parallelism. We introduce a quantum-enhanced policy iteration algorithm with provable polynomial reductions in sample complexity for the evaluation step, under standard assumptions. To demonstrate the technical feasibility and theoretical soundness of our approach, we validate Q-Policy on classical emulations of small discrete control tasks. Due to current hardware and simulation limitations, our experiments focus on showcasing proof-of-concept behavior rather than large-scale empirical evaluation. Our results support the potential of Q-Policy as a theoretical foundation for scalable RL on future quantum devices, addressing RL scalability challenges beyond classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Based Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has demonstrated the potential to solve computationally intensive problems more efficiently than classical methods. Many software engineering tasks, such as test case selection, static analysis, code clone detection, and defect prediction, involve complex optimization, search, or classification, making them candidates for quantum enhancement. In this paper, we introduce Quantum-Based Software Engineering (QBSE) as a new research direction for applying quantum computing to classical software engineering problems. We outline its scope, clarify its distinction from quantum software engineering (QSE), and identify key problem types that may benefit from quantum optimization, search, and learning techniques. We also summarize existing research efforts that remain fragmented. Finally, we outline a preliminary research agenda that may help guide the future development of QBSE, providing a structured and meaningful direction within software engineering.</description>
