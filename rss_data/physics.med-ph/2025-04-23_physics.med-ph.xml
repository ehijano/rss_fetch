      <title>AneuPy: An open source Python tool for creating simulation-ready geometries of abdominal aortic aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs predominantly affect older individuals, with a high mortality rate upon rupture, making early diagnosis and risk assessment critical. The geometric characteristics of an AAA, such as its maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness, play a crucial role in biomechanical models used to assess rupture risk. Despite the growing use of computational modeling to study AAAs, there is a lack of open source software that facilitates the generation of simulation-ready geometries tailored for biomechanical and hemodynamic analyses. To address this need, we introduce AneuPy, an open-source Python-based tool designed to generate idealized and patient-specific AAA geometrical models. AneuPy provides an efficient and automated approach to aneurysm geometry generation, requiring minimal input data while allowing for flexible parameterization. By streamlining the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, AneuPy aims to facilitate research in AAAs and enhance patient-specific risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Continuum Damage Modeling of Biaxial Fatigue Failure in Whole Bone: A Hybrid Approach with Machine Learning Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repetitive loading of bone is associated with microdamage accumulation and material property degradation that may ultimately result in fatigue fracture. Our previous work used continuum damage mechanics (CDM)-based finite element (FE) modeling to predict stiffness loss and fatigue failure in whole bone; however, this model did not account for inter-specimen variability in fatigue behaviour and multiaxial loading effects, which limited its applied efficacy. In this study, we refined the CDM-based FE model to predict experimental fatigue-life measurements from 21 whole rabbit tibiae subjected to cyclic axial compression with different magnitudes of superposed torsion. Machine learning (ML) methods were used to predict damage parameters from initial, undamaged, conditions, which were then used to predicted stiffness degradation and fatigue failure with the CDM-based FE modeling pipeline. Regression analysis was used to compare CDM-based FE fatigue-life predictions with experimental measurements. A random forest ML model predicted specimen-specific damage parameters with high accuracy (R2 = 0.85) and the CDM-based FE models demonstrated remarkable predictive capability, explaining up to 91% of the variance in fatigue-life measurements. Stiffness degradation profiles also followed a similar trend to experimental measurements; however, this agreement worsened with the level of superposed torsion suggesting additional refinements to the model may be necessary. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of integrating ML with CDM-based FE modeling to predict fatigue life and stiffness degradation. The observed agreement with experimental measurements suggests the modeling framework may provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms of fatigue fracture in whole bone</description>

      <title>Fluorescence Reference Target Quantitative Analysis Library</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standardized performance evaluation of fluorescence imaging systems remains a critical unmet need in the field of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). While the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) TG311 report and recent FDA draft guidance provide recommended metrics for system characterization, practical tools for extracting these metrics remain limited, inconsistent, and often inaccessible. We present QUEL-QAL, an open-source Python library designed to streamline and standardize the quantitative analysis of fluorescence images using solid reference targets. The library provides a modular, reproducible workflow that includes region of interest (ROI) detection, statistical analysis, and visualization capabilities. QUEL-QAL supports key metrics such as response linearity, limit of detection, depth sensitivity, and spatial resolution, in alignment with regulatory and academic guidance. Built on widely adopted Python packages, the library is designed to be extensible, enabling users to adapt it to novel target designs and analysis protocols. By promoting transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory alignment, QUEL-QAL offers a foundational tool to support standardized benchmarking and accelerate the development and evaluation of fluorescence imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization and ex vivo application of flexible 2D scintillating coatings in ultra-high dose rate electron beams for FLASH radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing interest in FLASH-RT has lead to the conversion of linear accelerators to enable ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) beams for preclinical research. Dosimetry hereof remains challenging with several crucial aspects missing. This work shows the challenges for real-time 2D UHDR dosimetry, and aims to present a solution in the context of preclinical irradiations in non-homogeneous UHDR electron beams. An experimental camera-scintillation sheet combination, was used to investigate the spatial dose distribution of a converted UHDR Varian Trilogy. The dosimetric system was characterized by variation of the number of pulses and source to surface distance (SSD) and its application was investigated by variation of bolus thickness and ambient light intensity. The challenges of prelcinical real time 2D dosimetry with scintillating coatings were assessed by ex vivo irradiations of a rat brain, mouse hindlimb and whole body mouse. Radiochromic EBT XD film was used as passive reference dosimeter. The coating showed a linear response with the number of pulses in the absence and presence of transparent bolus, up to 3 cm thick, and with the inverse squared SSD. The presence of ambient light reduces the signal-background ratio. The sheet showed to have sufficient flexibility to be molded on the subjects' surface, following its curvatures. Linearity with number of pulses was preserved in a preclinical setting. For small field sizes the light output became too low, resulting in noisy dose maps. The system showed robust within 5% for camera set up differences. Calibration of the system was complicated due to set up variations and the inhomogeneity of the beam. We showed the need for 2D real-time dosimetry to determine beam characteristics in non-homogeneous UHDR beams using a preclinical setting. We presented one solution to meet this need with scintillating based dosimetry.</description>

      <title>Improved energy-based scatter estimation by incorporating local energy spectra and accelerating the parametric fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PET requires accurate, precise, and efficient scatter correction techniques. Conventional scatter estimation typically relies on tail-fitted single-scatter simulation (SSS) strategy. However, the accuracy of tail-fitted SSS is limited, for example, by mismatches between the attenuation image and the PET emission data or by the presence of activity outside the FOV. These shortcomings can be addressed using energy-based scatter estimation (EBSE), as recently proposed by Efthimiou et al. and Hamill et al. The aim of this work is to 1. improve the accuracy of EBSE by accounting for the LOR dependence of the energy spectrum of unscattered photons, 2. improve the computational speed of EBSE through better initialization and a more efficient optimization algorithm. The proposed improved EBSE method models the energy probability density function (PDF) of both single and multiple scattered photons, and incorporates a position-dependent energy PDF for unscattered photons. These energy PDFs form the basis of two forward models used for scatter estimation based on 2D energy histograms. The performance of these models were evaluated using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and a NEMA phantom acquisition on a GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner. Furthermore, we assessed the stability of EBSE across the forward models by varying the number of counts in the 2D energy histograms via data mashing. EBSE outperformed tail-fitted SSS, particularly in regions near out-of-FOV activity. Our GATE simulations showed that incorporating a local energy for unscattered photons improves off-center regional quantification by approximately 2% points. Additionally, improved initialization combined with the NEGML optimizer enabling execution on a mashed TOF sinogram in 12 minutes on six-core CPU. The proposed method enhances both the accuracy and computational efficiency of EBSE, making it well-suited for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography of the human body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging the human body's morphological and angiographic information is essential for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. Ultrasonography performs the morphological assessment of the soft tissue based on acoustic impedance variations, whereas photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can visualize blood vessels based on intrinsic hemoglobin absorption. Three-dimensional (3D) panoramic imaging of the vasculature is generally not practical in conventional ultrasonography with limited field-of-view (FOV) probes, and PAT does not provide sufficient scattering-based soft tissue morphological contrast. Complementing each other, fast panoramic rotational ultrasound tomography (RUST) and PAT are integrated for hybrid rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography (RUS-PAT), which obtains 3D ultrasound structural and PAT angiographic images of the human body quasi-simultaneously. The RUST functionality is achieved in a cost-effective manner using a single-element ultrasonic transducer for ultrasound transmission and rotating arc-shaped arrays for 3D panoramic detection. RUST is superior to conventional ultrasonography, which either has a limited FOV with a linear array or is high-cost with a hemispherical array that requires both transmission and receiving. By switching the acoustic source to a light source, the system is conveniently converted to PAT mode to acquire angiographic images in the same region. Using RUS-PAT, we have successfully imaged the human head, breast, hand, and foot with a 10 cm diameter FOV, submillimeter isotropic resolution, and 10 s imaging time for each modality. The 3D RUS-PAT is a powerful tool for high-speed, 3D, dual-contrast imaging of the human body with potential for rapid clinical translation.</description>
