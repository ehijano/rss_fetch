      <title>A strong finiteness condition for smashing localisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a class of smashing localisations which we call compactly central, and classify compactly central localisations of $Sp_{(p)}$ and of $Sp$. Our main result is that $L_n^f$ is a compactly central localisation.
  A map $\alpha: 1 \to A$ in a presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathscr{C}$ is central if there exists a homotopy $\alpha \otimes id_A \simeq id_A \otimes \alpha: A \to A \otimes A$. A central map $\alpha$ can be used to produce a smashing localisation $L_\alpha$ of $\mathscr{C}$, because the free $\mathbb{E}_1$ algebra on the $\mathbb{E}_0$ algebra $\alpha$ is an idempotent commutative algebra. When both the monoidal unit and $A$ are compact, we call $L_\alpha$ compactly central. We show that when $\mathscr{C}$ is (compactly generated) rigid, all compactly central localisations are finite in the sense of Miller. Not all finite localisations of $Sp$ are compactly central. To exhibit $L_n^f$ as compactly central, we determine properties of the $K(n)$-homology of a map between $p$-local finite spectra which ensure that some tensor power of the map is central.</description>

      <title>Chern character for torsion-free ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an ample groupoid with torsion-free stabilizers, we construct a Chern character map going from the domain of the Baum-Connes assembly map of G to the groupoid homology groups of G with rational coefficients. As a main application, assuming the (rational) Baum-Connes conjecture, we prove the rational form of Matui's HK conjecture, i.e., we show that the operator K-groups of the groupoid C*-algebra are rationally isomorphic to the periodicized groupoid homology groups. Our construction hinges on the recent $\infty$-categorical viewpoint on bivariant K-theory, and does not rely on typical noncommutative geometry tools such as the Chern-Connes character and the periodic cyclic homology of smooth algebras. We also present applications to the homology of hyperbolic dynamical systems, the homology of topological full groups, the homotopy type of the algebraic K-theory spectrum of ample groupoids, and the Elliott invariant of classifiable C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Finite abelian group actions on weakly Lefschetz cohomologically symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite abelian group actions on weakly Lefschetz cohomologically symplectic (WLS) manifolds, a collection of manifolds that includes all compact connected Kaehler manifolds. We prove that for any WLS manifold $X$ there exists a number $C$ such that, for any integer $m\geq C$, if $({\mathbf Z}/m)^k$ acts freely on $X$, then $\sum_j b_j(X;{\mathbf Q})\geq 2^k$.
  We also prove a structure theorem for effective actions on WLS manifolds of $({\mathbf Z}/p)^r$, where $p$ is a big enough prime, analogous to some results for tori of Lupton and Oprea, and we find bounds on the discrete degree of symmetry of WLS manifolds.
  Our technique, which may be of independent interest, is based on studying the cohomology of abelian covers of WLS manifolds $X$ associated to certain maps $\pi:X\to T^k$. We prove that, in the presence of actions of arbitrarily big finite abelian groups, some of these abelian covers have finitely generated cohomology, and the spectral sequence associated to $\pi$ degenerates at the second page over the rationals.</description>

      <title>Computing singular simplicial homologies of digraphs and quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of large complex systems are predominately modeled through pairwise interactions, the principle underlying structure being a network of the form of a digraph or quiver. Significant success has been obtained in applying the homology of the directed flag complex to study digraphs arising as networks within numerous scientific disciplines. This homology of directed cliques enjoys relative ease of computation when compared to other digraph homologies, making it preferable for use in applications concerning large networks. By extending the ideas of singular simplicial homology to quivers in categories of different morphism types, several new singular simplicial homology theories have recently been constructed.
  Computationally efficient homologies for quivers have in general not previously been seriously considered. In this paper we develop further the homotopy theory of quivers necessary to derive functors that realise isomorphisms between the singular simplicial quiver homologies and the homologies of certain spaces. The simplicial chains of these spaces arise in a conveniently compact form that is at least as convenient as the directed flag complex for computations.
  Moreover, our constructions are natural with respect to the isomorphisms on homology making them suitable for applications in conjunction with persistent homology for practical use. In particular, for each of the singular simplicial homologies considered, we provide efficient algorithms for the computation of their persistent homology.</description>

      <title>Induction in perverse schobers and cluster tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit gluing properties of cluster tilting subcategories in exact $\infty$-categories within the framework of perverse schobers on surfaces with boundary. These results are based on a study of the restriction functors from global sections of perverse schobers to local sections and their adjoint induction functors. New examples include cluster tilting subcategories in higher rank topological Fukaya categories related to higher Teichm\"uller theory, and cluster tilting subcategories arising from marked surfaces with punctures.</description>
