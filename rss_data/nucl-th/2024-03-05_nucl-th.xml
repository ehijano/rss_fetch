      <title>Five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian with improved inertial functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: To describe shape fluctuations associated with large-amplitude collective motion in the quadrupole degrees of freedom, the five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) has been widely used. The inertial functions in the 5DCH are microscopically calculated with the energy density functional (EDF) theory employing the cranking formula. However, since the cranking formula ignores dynamical residual effects, it is known to fail to reproduce the correct inertial functions, for instance, the total mass for the translational motion.
  Purpose: We aim to resolve problems of the insufficient description of the inertial functions in the 5DCH. We provide a practical method to include the dynamical residual effects in the inertial functions that depend on the quadrupole deformation parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
  Methods: We use the local quasiparticle random-phase approximation (LQRPA) based on the constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states in the $\beta$--$\gamma$ plane with the Skyrme EDF. The finite-amplitude method is used for efficient computations of the LQRPA.
  Results: The inertial functions evaluated with the LQRPA significantly increase from the ones with the cranking formula due to the dynamical residual effects. This increase also shows a strong $\beta$--$\gamma$ dependence. We show an application of the present method to a transitional nucleus $^{110}$Pd. The low-lying positive-parity spectra are well reproduced with the LQRPA inertial functions.
  Conclusions: We clarify the importance of the dynamical residual effects in the inertial functions of the 5DCH for the description of the low-lying spectra. The 5DCH with the improved inertial functions provides a reliable and efficient description of low-lying spectra in nuclei associated with the quadrupole shape fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Novel Pauli blocking method in quantum molecular dynamics type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calculating the occupation probability in the Pauli blocking of the quantum molecular dynamics type models. This method refines the description of the Pauli blocking ratio in the nuclear matter and that in the finite nucleus. The influence of the new Pauli blocking method on the heavy ion collisions observables, such as the charge distribution, the free neutron to proton yield ratios, and the extracted physical quantities, such as the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, are investigated. For the extracted in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, our results show that it will be enhanced 1.1$-$2.5 times than that with the conventional Pauli blocking method at the beam energy less than 150 MeV/u, which highlights the importance of a refined Pauli blocking method for developing an advanced transport model to describe complex heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Production of Resonances in Partial Chemical Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the model of partial chemical equilibrium (PCE) we calculate the multiplicity ratios of selected unstable resonances to given stable species. We focus on those ratios that have been measured either in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC or in Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy. The model provides an interpretation how in an expanding hadronic fireball with decreasing temperature the final numbers of stable hadrons after decays of all resonances remain unchanged. Each stable species acquires its own chemical potential and the resonances are kept in equilibrium with them. Multiplicities of unstable resonances provide a test of this scenario. We observe that the ratios of $K^{*}/K$ and $\rho^0/\pi$ fit reasonably well into the picture of single kinetic freeze-out of the single-particle spectra, but the $\phi$-meson and hyperon resonances are not reproduced by this model.</description>

      <title>The role of the likelihood for elastic scattering uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Analyses of elastic scattering with the optical model (OMP) are widely used in nuclear reactions.
  Purpose: Previous work compared a traditional frequentist approach and a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainties in the OMP. In this study, we revisit this comparison and consider the role of the likelihood used in the analysis.
  Method: We compare the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for $\chi^{2}$ minimization with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain parameter posteriors. Following previous work, we consider how results are affected when $\chi^{2}$/N is used for the likelihood function, N being the number of data points, to account for possible correlations in the model and underestimation of the error in the data.
  Results: We analyze a simple linear model and then move to OMP analysis of elastic angular distributions using a) a 5-parameter model and b) a 6-parameter model. In the linear model, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches yield consistent optima and uncertainty estimates. The same is qualitatively true for the 5-parameter OMP analysis. For the 6-parameter OMP analysis, the parameter posterior is no longer well-approximated by a Gaussian and a covariance-based frequentist prediction becomes unreliable. In all cases, when the Bayesian approach uses $\chi^{2}$/N in the likelihood, uncertainties increase by $\sqrt{N}$.
  Conclusions: When the parameter posterior is near-Gaussian and the same likelihood is used, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches recover consistent parameter uncertainty estimates. If the parameter posterior has significant higher moments, the covariance-only frequentist approach becomes unreliable and the Bayesian approach should be used. Empirical coverage can serve as an important internal check for uncertainty estimation, providing red flags for uncertainty analyses.</description>

      <title>Pole properties of a resonance: When to subtract partial-decay widths to obtain the pole widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a resonance lies near the threshold of a heavier channel, an interesting feature can occur. The paradigmatic example employed here is the scalar isoscalar $f_0(980)$ resonance that couples to the lighter $\pi\pi$ and heavier $K\bar{K}$ channels. It is shown that the decay width is given by the sum or subtraction of the partial decay widths depending on whether the pole lies in the Riemann sheet that is contiguous with the physical one above or below the $K\bar{K}$ threshold, respectively. Next, we show that the usually disregarded renormalization of bare parameters in Flatt\'e or energy-dependent Breit-Wigner parameterizations is essential to extract physical information. The compositeness of the $f_0(980)$ by using a Flatt\'e parameterization matched to reproduce the pole properties obtained from Roy equations and other analytic constraints is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Charge-conjugation asymmetry and molecular content: the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ in matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the modifications that a dense nuclear medium induces in the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^\pm$. In the vacuum, we consider them as isoscalar $D^{(*)}K$ and $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ $S$-wave bound states, which are dynamically generated from effective interactions that lead to different Weinberg compositeness scenarios. Matter effects are incorporated through the two-meson loop functions, taking into account the self energies that the $D^{(*)}$, $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}$, $K$, and $\overline{K}$ develop when embedded in a nuclear medium. Although particle-antiparticle [$D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^+$ versus $D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^-$] lineshapes are the same in vacuum, we find extremely different density patterns in matter. This charge-conjugation asymmetry mainly stems from the very different kaon and antikaon interaction with the nucleons of the dense medium. We show that the in-medium lineshapes found for these resonances strongly depend on their $D^{(*)}K$/$\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ molecular content, and discuss how this novel feature can be used to better determine/constrain the inner structure of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>A Light-Front Model for the Transition Distribution Amplitudes for Backward Timelike Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To access information on the internal structure of the nucleon, data from a variety of scattering experiments can be analyzed, in regimes where the information factorizes from an otherwise known scattering amplitude. A recent development, promising new insight, is the study of exclusive reactions in the backward kinematical region, where the information can be encoded in Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDAs). We model the photon-to-nucleon TDAs, entering the factorized description of backward Timelike Compton Scattering, using techniques of light-front dynamics to integrate information from a quark model for the photon and the nucleon. We include the results of numerical predictions that could inform further experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future Electron--Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical solution of relativistic hydrodynamics for a system having cylindrical symmetry with boost-invariant longitudinal expansion and Hubble-like transverse expansion. We also consider analytical solution for Hubble-like spherically expanding system. For these two cases, we calculate analytical expression for transverse momentum spectra of hadrons, at constant temperature freeze-out hypersurface using Cooper-Frye prescription. We compare our results for transverse momentum spectra with experimental results from Large Hadron Collider and CERN SPS where one expects cylindrical and spherical geometry of the fireball, respectively. In the case of low-energy collisions with spherical geometry, we calculate rapidity spectra and compare with the results from CERN SPS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its role in the continuing evolution of the Universe, only a small fraction of the mass of visible material can be attributed to the Higgs boson alone. The overwhelmingly dominant share may/should arise from the strong interactions that act in the heart of nuclear matter; namely, those described by quantum chromodynamics. This contribution describes how studying and explaining the attributes of pseudoscalar mesons can open an insightful window onto understanding the origin of mass in the Standard Model and how these insights inform our knowledge of hadron structure. The survey ranges over distribution amplitudes and functions, electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, light-front wave functions, and generalized parton distributions. Advances made using continuum Schwinger function methods and their relevance for experimental efforts are highlighted.</description>

      <title>J/psi-pair production at NLL in TMD factorisation at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: J/psi-pair production at the LHC is currently one of the few tools available to probe gluon transverse momentum distributions (TMDs). In this context, data from LHCb in the collider mode have the potential to probe the evolution of the unpolarised-gluon TMDs and to measure the distribution of the linearly-polarised gluon in unpolarised protons for the first time. In this proceedings contribution, improved predictions obtained for the LHC (at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV) up to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL) in TMD factorisation are presented. We show the obtained predictions of transverse-momentum distributions at different invariant masses and rapidities computed in the LHCb acceptance along with PDF uncertainty. We predict the azimuthal modulations of the cross section that arise from linearly-polarised gluons.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Collins-Soper Kernel from Chiral Quarks with Physical Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model is used to investigate the efficacy of several flow observables to constrain the initial-state deformation of the Uranium nuclei in U$+$U collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{\textit{s}_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV. The multiparticle azimuthal cumulant method is used to investigate the sensitivity of (I) a set of quantities that are sensitive to both initial- and final-state effects as well as (II) a set of dimensionless quantities that are more sensitive to initial-state effects to the Uranium nuclei quadrupole shape deformation. We find that the combined use of the flow harmonics, flow fluctuations and correlations, linear and non-linear flow correlations to the quadrangular flow harmonic, and the correlations between elliptic flow and the mean-transverse momentum could serve to constrain the nuclear deformation of the Uranium nuclei. Therefore, a comprehensive set of measurements of such observables can provide a quantifying tool for the quadrupole shape deformation via data-model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Four-Body Systems at Large Cutoffs in Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06172v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-body systems are studied using an effective field theory with two- and three-body contact interactions. A method to systematically address deep trimers (three-body bound states that are more tightly bound than four-body bound/resonant states) in four-body calculations is developed using a diagrammatic approach. Previous calculations were limited by the existence of deep trimers, which this work overcomes. For cold $^4$He atoms, binding energies of 526.1(5)~mK and 128.517(1)~mK are obtained at leading order for the tetramer ground and excited states, respectively, where errors come from the truncation of three-body partial waves. Tetramer binding energies and decay widths are also computed approaching the unitary limit. In the unitary limit, there are two tetramers associated with each trimer of binding energy $B_3^{(0)}$. The binding energy and decay width for the associated tetramer ground state are $E_4^{(0)} = 4.60(1)B_3^{(0)}$ and $\Gamma_4^{(0)}/2 = 0.0160(1)B_3^{(0)}$, respectively, and for the associated tetramer excited state, $E_4^{(1)} = 1.0022(3)B_3^{(0)}$ and $\Gamma_4^{(1)}/2 = 2.57(2)\times 10^{-4}B_3^{(0)}$, respectively. This calculation is a gateway to higher-order and/or more-body calculations in nuclear and atomic systems.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian study of quark models in view of recent astrophysical constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comparative analysis between the density-dependent quark model and the vector MIT bag model using Bayesian analysis. We use the equations of state generated by these two models to describe quark stars. We impose four recent observational astrophysical constraints on both models to determine their model-dependent parameters in an optimized manner assuming that the compact objects observed are composed entirely of self-bound quarks. The restrictions are aimed at producing stars with maximum masses $2 - 2.35$ M$_\odot$ and a mass-radii diagram compatible with the observed pulsars: PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0952-0607, PSR J0030+0451 and the compact object XMMU J173203.3-344518. With this analysis, the parameter dependence of the nuclear equation of state (EoS) of both models is restricted.</description>

      <title>Thermal twin stars within a hybrid equation of state based on a nonlocal chiral quark model compatible with modern astrophysical observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the extension to finite temperatures and neutrino chemical potentials of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model approach to the equation of state of neutron star matter. We consider two light quark flavors and current-current interactions in the scalar-pseudoscalar, vector, and diquark pairing channels, where the nonlocality of the currents is taken into account by a Gaussian form factor that depends on the spatial components of the 4-momentum. Within this framework, we analyze order parameters, critical temperatures, phase diagrams, equations of state, and mass-radius relations for different temperatures and neutrino chemical potentials. For parameters of the model that are constrained by recent multi-messenger observations of neutron stars, we find that the mass-radius diagram for isothermal hybrid star sequences exhibits the thermal twin phenomenon for temperatures above 30 MeV.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-neutrino versus recoil formalism for 4-body phase space and applications to nuclear decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the traditional treatment of radiative corrections that utilizes the "true" neutrino momentum $\vec{p}_\nu$ in the differential decay rate formula could lead to a $\sim \alpha/\pi$ systematic error in certain observables due to the mistreatment of 4-body kinematics. We investigate the theory structure of one of the proposed solutions, the "$\nu'$-formalism", in the non-recoil limit appropriate for neutron and nuclear beta decays. We derive an elegant master formula for the 4-body phase space and use it to re-analyze the spectrum-dependent "outer" radiative corrections to the beta decay of a polarized spin-half nucleus; a complete set of analytic expressions is provided for readers to straightforwardly obtain the final numerical results. We compare it to the "recoil formalism" where the energy of the recoil nucleus is fixed.</description>

      <title>Shell-model study of $^{58}$Ni using quantum computing algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a simulated quantum computing approach for the investigation into the shell-model energy levels of $^{58}$Ni through the application of the variational eigensolver (VQE) method in combination with a problem-specific ansatz. The primary objective is to achieve a fully accurate low-lying energy spectrum of $^{58}$Ni. The chosen isotope, $^{58}$Ni is particularly interesting in nuclear physics through its role in astrophysical reactions while also being a simple but not-trivial nucleus for shell-model study, it being two particles outside a closed shell. Our ansatz, along with the VQE method are shown to be able to reproduce exact energy values for the ground state and first and second excited states. We compare a classical shell model code, the values obtained by diagonalization of the Hamiltonian after qubit mapping, and a noiseless simulated ansatz+VQE simulation. The exact agreement between classical and qubit-mapped diagonalisation shows the correctness of our method, and the high accuracy of the simulation means that the ansatz is suitable to allow a full reconstruction of the full nuclear wave function.</description>

      <title>Maximum gravitational mass $M_{\rm TOV}=2.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}M_\odot$ inferred at about $3\%$ precision with multimessenger data of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximal gravitational mass of nonrotating neutron stars ($M_{\rm TOV}$) is one of the key parameters of compact objects and only loose bounds can be set based on the first principle. With reliable measurements of the masses and/or radii of the neutron stars, $M_{\rm TOV}$ can be robustly inferred from either the mass distribution of these objects or the reconstruction of the equation of state (EoS) of the very dense matter. For the first time we take the advantages of both two approaches to have a precise inference of $M_{\rm TOV}=2.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~M_\odot$ (68.3\% credibility), with the updated neutron star mass measurement sample, the mass-tidal deformability data of GW170817, the mass-radius data of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the theoretical information from the chiral effective theory ($\chi$EFT) and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) at low and very high energy densities, respectively. This narrow credible range is benefited from the suppression of the high $M_{\rm TOV}$ by the pQCD constraint and the exclusion of the low $M_{\rm TOV}$ by the mass function. Three different EoS reconstruction methods are adopted separately, and the resulting $M_{\rm TOV}$ and $R_{\rm TOV}$ are found to be almost identical, where $R_{\rm TOV}=11.90^{+0.63}_{-0.60}$ km is the radius of the most massive non-rotating NS. This precisely evaluated $M_{\rm TOV}$ suggests that the EoS of neutron star matter is just moderately stiff and the $\sim 2.5-3M_\odot$ compact objects detected by the second generation gravitational wave detectors are most likely the lightest black holes.</description>

      <title>Efficient vacuum state preparation for quantum simulation of strongly interacting local quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient approach for preparing ground states in the context of strongly interacting local quantum field theories on quantum computers. The approach produces the vacuum state in a time proportional to the square-root of the volume, which is a square-root improvement in speed compared to traditional approaches. The approach exploits a novel method for traversing the path in parameter space in which the resources scale linearly with a path length suitably defined in parameter space. Errors due to practical limitations are controlled and do not exhibit secular growth along the path. The final accuracy can be arbitrarily improved with an additive cost, which is independent of the volume and grows slower than logarithmically with the overlap between the state produced and the exact ground state. We expect that the method could potentially hold practical value not only within the realm of quantum field theories but also in addressing other challenges involving long path lengths.</description>

      <title>A unified description of DGLAP, CSS, and BFKL: TMD factorization bridging large and small x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization scheme designed to unify both large and small Bjorken-x regimes. We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to the gluon TMD operator for an unpolarized hadron within this proposed scheme. This leads to the emergence of a new TMD evolution, incorporating those in transverse momentum, rapidity, and Bjorken-x. When matched to the collinear factorization scheme, our factorization scheme faithfully reproduces the well-established Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) and Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolutions. Conversely, matching with high-energy factorization not only yields the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution but also reveals distinctive signatures of CSS logarithms. The development of this novel TMD factorization scheme, capable of seamlessly reconciling disparate Bjorken-x regimes and faithfully reproducing established QCD evolution equations, has the potential to significantly advance our comprehension of high-energy processes and three-dimensional parton structures of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Can quantum statistics help distinguish Dirac from Majorana neutrinos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding out if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is known to be extremely difficult due to the smallness of neutrino mass and the fact that in the limit $m_\nu=0$ both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos become Weyl particles, i.e. are indistinguishable. There have been suggestions in the literature that in the case of processes with production of a neutrino-antineutrino pair (if neutrinos are Dirac particles) or two neutrinos (if they are of Majorana nature) quantum statistics may be of help. This is because for Majorana neutrinos quantum indistinguishability of identical particles requires the amplitude of the process to be antisymmetrized with respect to the interchange of the final-state neutrinos, whereas no such antisymmetrization must be done for Dirac neutrinos. It has been claimed that the resulting differences between the cross sections for Dirac and Majorana neutrinos persist even for arbitrarily small but not exactly vanishing neutrino mass. We demonstrate that, at least in the framework of the Standard Model, this is not the case. We also give a general proof that within the Standard Model quantum statistics does not help tell Dirac and Majorana neutrinos apart in the limit of negligibly small $m_\nu/E$.</description>
