      <title>A Generalised Haldane Map from the Matrix Product State Path Integral to the Critical Theory of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1/2$ chain using a path integral constructed over matrix product states (MPS). By virtue of its non-trivial entanglement structure, the MPS ansatz captures the key phases of the model even at a semi-classical, saddle-point level, and, as a variational state, is in good agreement with the field theory obtained by abelian bosonisation. Going beyond the semi-classical level, we show that the MPS ansatz facilitates a physically-motivated derivation of the field theory of the critical phase: by carefully taking the continuum limit -- a generalisation of the Haldane map -- we recover from the MPS path integral a field theory with the correct topological term and emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, constructively linking the microscopic states and topological field-theoretic structures. Moreover, the dimerisation transition is particularly clear in the MPS formulation -- an explicit dimerisation potential becomes relevant, gapping out the magnetic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Majorana zero modes in the spin-1/2 Kitaev ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional $p$-wave superconductor, characterized by boundary Majorana modes, has attracted significant interest owing to its potential application in topological quantum computation. Similarly, spin-1/2 Kitaev ladder systems with bond-dependent Ising interactions, featuring Majorana fermions coupled with $Z_2$ flux, exhibit boundary Majorana modes when in a topological phase. However, the ground state degeneracy, inherent in these systems, may result in the annihilation of Majorana modes due to the superposition of the two states. To address this issue, we introduce a projective measurement that selects one of the degenerate $Z_2$ sectors, enabling the emergence of Majorana modes. Once the state is selected, we show that the application of the local spin operators on a bond flips the sign of the adjacent $Z_2$ flux. Repeating such operators enables the system to reach a desired $Z_2$ flux configuration. We present the phase diagram and the appearance of Majorana modes at the interfaces of topological and non-topological phases. These modes, along with boundary Majorana modes, can be manipulated and fused by tuning the flux sectors achievable through applying local spin operators. We also discuss the engineering of the Kitaev ladder and open questions for future studies.</description>

      <title>Dirac Impurity in a Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a linearly-dispersing quantum impurity interacting through a contact density-density term with a one-dimensional (1D) superfluid described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. Using a linked cluster expansion we characterize the impurity dynamics by calculating approximate expressions for the single-particle Green's function and for the time evolution of the density profile. We show the existence of two different dynamical regimes: (i) a $\textit{quasiparticle}$ regime, dominated by the presence of a finite lifetime for the host impurity, and (ii) an $\textit{infrared-dominated}$ regime, where the impurity causes a Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe of the 1D bath. We discuss the possible experimental consequences of these findings for cold atoms experiments.</description>

      <title>Identifying the ground state phases by spin-patterns in the Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the influence of frustration on the phases and related phase transitions in condensed matter physics is of fundamental importance in uncovering the role played by frustration. In the two-dimensional square lattice, a minimal frustration has been formulated in 1981 as the Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model described by competitions between the nearest-neighbor bond ($J_1$) and the next-nearest-neighbor one ($J_2$). In the two limits of $\alpha=J_2/J_1$, i.e. $\alpha \ll 1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$, the corresponding phases are the N{\'e}el antiferromagnet (AFM) and the dimer-singlet(DS). Unfortunately, the intermediate regime remains controversial, and the nature of transition from the N{\'e}el AFM to the intermediate state is also unclear. Here we provide a pattern language to explore the SS model and take the lattice size $L=4 \times4$ with periodic boundary condition. We firstly diagonalize the Hamiltonian in an operator space to obtain all fundamental spin-patterns and then analyze their energy and occupancy evolutions with the frustration parameter $\kappa=\alpha / (1+\alpha)$. Our results indicate that the intermediate regime is characterized by diagonal two-domain spin-pattern while the N{\'e}el AFM state has a diagonal single-domain and the DS has mixings of diagonal single- and four-domain. While the transition from the DS to the intermediate phase occurred around $\alpha_c = 1.5$ is the first-order in nature, consistent with that in literature, the one from the intermediate phase to the AFM is clearly seen around $\alpha_c = 1.277$, where it has a reversal of the contributions from the single- and two-domain patterns to the ground state. The result indicates that the pattern language is powerful in identifying the possible phases in frustrated models.</description>

      <title>Imaging Tunable Luttinger Liquid Systems in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) interacting electrons are often described as a Luttinger liquid1-4 having properties that are intrinsically different from Fermi liquids in higher dimensions5,6. 1D electrons in materials systems exhibit exotic quantum phenomena that can be tuned by both intra- and inter-1D-chain electronic interactions, but their experimental characterization can be challenging. Here we demonstrate that layer-stacking domain walls (DWs) in van der Waals heterostructures form a broadly tunable Luttinger liquid system including both isolated and coupled arrays. We have imaged the evolution of DW Luttinger liquids under different interaction regimes tuned by electron density using a novel scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) technique. Single DWs at low carrier density are highly susceptible to Wigner crystallization consistent with a spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid, while at intermediate densities dimerized Wigner crystals form due to an enhanced magneto-elastic coupling. Periodic arrays of DWs exhibit an interplay between intra- and inter-chain interactions that gives rise to new quantum phases. At low electron densities inter-chain interactions are dominant and induce a 2D electron crystal composed of phased-locked 1D Wigner crystal in a staggered configuration. Increased electron density causes intra-chain fluctuation potentials to dominate, leading to an electronic smectic liquid crystal phase where electrons are ordered with algebraical correlation decay along the chain direction but disordered between chains. Our work shows that layer-stacking DWs in 2D heterostructures offers new opportunities to explore Luttinger liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Does carrier localization affect the anomalous Hall effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of carrier localization due to electron-electron interaction in anomalous Hall effect is elusive and there are contradictory results in the literature. To address the issue, we report here the detailed transport study including the Hall measurements on $\beta$-Mn type cubic compound Co$_7$Zn$_7$Mn$_6$ with chiral crystal structure, which lacks global mirror symmetry. The alloy orders magnetically below $T_c$ = 204 K, and reported to show spin glass state at low temperature. The longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) shows a pronounced upturn below $T_{min}$ = 75 K, which is found to be associated with carrier localization due to quantum interference effect. The upturn in $\rho_{xx}$ shows a $T^{1/2}$ dependence and it is practically insensitive to the externally applied magnetic field, which indicate that electron-electron interaction is primarily responsible for the low-$T$ upturn. The studied sample shows considerable value of anomalous Hall effect below $T_c$. We found that the localization effect is present in the ordinary Hall coefficient ($R_0$), but we failed to observe any signature of localization in the anomalous Hall resistivity or conductivity. The absence of localization effect in the anomalous Hall effect in Co$_7$Zn$_7$Mn$_6$ may be due to large carrier density, and it warrants further theoretical investigations, particularly with systems having broken mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Anomalous magnetic transition in a disordered quasicrystal approximant with heavy-fermion nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystal approximant (CexY1-x)Cd6 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1) forms a network of corner-sharing octahedra. We report that (Ce0.8Y0.2)Cd6 exhibits an anomalous magnetic transition which can be classified neither into the conventional static magnetic ordering nor into spin glasses. The anomalous transition is characterized by the coexistence of a static order and a frequency-dependent sharp positive anomaly in the 3rd-harmonic susceptibility. Based on the investigation of the reference systems CeCd6 and (Ce0.05Y0.95)Cd6, we speculate that the anomalous transition could be induced by disorder in the possible frustrated Ce-network in the presence of the Kondo effect.</description>

      <title>Potential energy surfaces from many-body functionals: analytical benchmarks and conserving many-body approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate analytically the performance of many-body energy functionals, derived respectively by Klein and Luttinger and Ward, at different levels of diagrammatic approximations, ranging from second Born, to GW, to the so-called T-matrix, for the calculation of total energies and potential energy surfaces. We benchmark our theoretical results on the extended two-site Hubbard model, which is analytically solvable and for which several exact properties can be calculated. Despite its simplicity, this model displays the physics of strongly correlated electrons: it is prototypical of the H$_2$ dissociation, a notoriously difficult problem to solve accurately for the majority of mean-field based approaches. We show that both functionals exhibit good to excellent variational properties, particularly in the case of the Luttinger-Ward one, which is in close agreement with fully self-consistent calculations, and elucidate the relation between the accuracy of the results and the different input one-body Green's functions. Provided that these are wisely chosen, we show how the Luttinger-Ward functional can be used as a computationally inexpensive alternative to fully self-consistent many-body calculations, without sacrificing the precision of the results obtained. Furthermore, in virtue of this accuracy, we argue that this functional can also be used to rank different many-body approximations at different regimes of electronic correlation, once again bypassing the need for self-consistency.</description>

      <title>The magnetization process of classical Heisenberg magnets with non-coplanar cuboc ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a classical Heisenberg model on the kagom\'{e} and the square kagom\'{e} lattice, where at zero magnetic field non-coplanar cuboctahedral ground states with twelve sublattices exist if suitable exchange couplings are introduced between the other neighbors. Such 'cuboc ground states' are remarkable because they allow for chiral ordering. For these models, we discuss the magnetization process in an applied magnetic field $H$ by both numerical and analytical methods. We find some universal properties that are present in all models. The magnetization curve $M(H)$ usually contains only non-linear components and there is at least one magnetic field driven phase transition. Details of the $M(H)$ curve such as the number and characteristics (continuous or discontinuous) of the phase transitions depend on the lattice and the details of the exchange between the further neighbors. Typical features of these magnetization processes can already be derived for a paradigmatic 12 spin model that we define in this work.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap phase as fluctuating pair density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical nature of pseudogap phase is one of the most important and intriguing problems towards understanding the key mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Theoretically, the square-lattice $t$-$J$ model is widely believed to be the simplest toy model that captures the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. We employ the Grassmann tensor product state approach to investigate uniform states in the underdoped ($\delta \lesssim 0.1$) region. In addition to the previously known uniform $d$-wave state, we discover a strongly fluctuating pair density wave (PDW) state with wave vector $Q = (\pi, \pi)$. This fluctuating PDW state weakly breaks the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of the square lattice and has a lower or comparable energy to the $d$-wave state (depending on doping and the $t/J$ ratio), making it a promising candidate state for describing the pseudogap phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create new states of matter out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. The 2- and 4-party cases are also covered with examples. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density and Sum Rules for Second-Order Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum rules for linear response functions give powerful and experimentally-relevant relations between frequency moments of response functions and ground state properties. In particular, renewed interest has been drawn to optical conductivity and density-density sum rules and their connection to quantum geometry in topological materials. At the same time, recent work has also illustrated the connection between quantum geometry and second-order nonlinear response functions in quantum materials, motivating the search for exact sum rules for second-order response that can provide experimental probes and theoretical constraints for geometry and topology in these systems. Here we begin to address these questions by developing a general formalism for deriving sum rules for second-order response functions. Using generalized Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that the second-order Kubo formula can be expressed in terms of a spectral density that is a sum of Dirac delta functions in frequency. We show that moments of the spectral density can be expressed in terms of averages of equal-time commutators, yielding a family of generalized sum rules; furthermore, these sum rules constrain the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the second harmonic generation rate. We apply our formalism to study generalized $f$-sum rules for the second-order density-density response function and the longitudinal nonlinear conductivity. We show that for noninteracting electrons in solids, the generalized $f$-sum rule can be written entirely in terms of matrix elements of the Bloch Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive a family of sum rules for rectification response, determining the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the time-independent response to a harmonic perturbation.</description>

      <title>Tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of NiBr$_2$ via pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dihalides (MX$_2$, M= transition metal, X= halide) have attracted much attention recently due to their intriguing low-dimensional magnetic properties. Particular focus has been placed in this family in the context of multiferroicity -- a common occurrence in MX$_2$ compounds that adopt non-collinear magnetic structures. One example of helimagnetic multiferroic material in the dihalide family is represented by NiBr$_2$. Here, we study the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this material under pressure using first-principles calculations combined with Monte Carlo simulations. Our results indicate there is significant magnetic frustration in NiBr$_2$ due to the competing interactions arising from its underlying triangular lattice. This magnetic frustration increases with pressure and is at the origin of the helimagnetic order. Further, pressure causes a sizable increase in the interlayer interactions. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that a large (3-fold) increase in the helimagnetic transition temperature can be achieved at pressures of around 15 GPa. This indicates that hydrostatic pressure can indeed be used as a tuning knob to increase the magnetic transition temperature of NiBr$_2$.</description>

      <title>Preparing matrix product states via fusion: constraints and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries and serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.</description>

      <title>Classifying One-Dimensional Quantum States Prepared by a Single Round of Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements and feedback have emerged as a powerful resource for creating quantum states. However, a detailed understanding is restricted to fixed-point representatives of phases of matter. Here, we go beyond this and ask which types of many-body entanglement can be created from measurement. Focusing on one spatial dimension, a framework is developed for the case where a single round of measurements are the only entangling operations. We show this creates matrix product states and identify necessary and sufficient tensor conditions for preparability, which uniquely determine the preparation protocol. These conditions are then used to characterize the physical constraints on preparable quantum states. First, we find a trade-off between the richness of the preparable entanglement spectrum and correlation functions, which moreover leads to a powerful no-go theorem. Second, in a subset of cases, where undesired measurement outcomes can be independently paired up and corrected, we are able to provide a complete classification for preparable quantum states. Finally, we connect properties of the preparation protocol to the resulting phase of matter, including trivial, symmetry-breaking, and symmetry-protected topological phases -- for both uniform and modulated symmetries. This work offers a resource-theoretic perspective on preparable quantum entanglement and shows how to systematically create states of matter, away from their fixed points, in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Revealing the regularities of electron correlation energies associated with valence electrons in atoms in the first three rows of the periodic table</title>

Abstract: Electronic correlation is a complex many-body effect and the correlation energy depends on the specific electronic structure and spatial distribution of electrons in each atom and molecule. Although the total correlation energy in an atom can be decomposed into different components such as inter-orbital and intra-orbital pair-correlation energies (PCE), it is generally believed that the PCEs in different atoms cannot be the same. In this work, we investigate the correlation energies of the atoms in the first three rows of the periodic table (He to Ar). It is found that when the correlation energy is defined as the difference between the exact ground-state energy and the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) energy, the inter- and intra-orbital PECs associated with the valence electrons of the atoms in the same row of the periodic table have the same values. These PCEs are not entangled and their values depend only on the electron orbitals. For two specific orbitals, the inter-orbital correlation energy is the same between two electrons of parallel spins or anti-parallel spins. We also show that the effects of orbital relaxation on the correlation energy are surprisingly small.</description>

      <title>Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

      <title>Narrowly avoided spin-nematic phase in BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$: NMR evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigation of BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$ focusing on the nearly saturated regime between $\mu_0H_{c1}$ = 4.05 T and $\mu_0H_{c2}$ = 6.5 T, which used to be considered a promising candidate for a spin-nematic phase. NMR spectra establish the absence of any dipolar order there, whereas the weak field dependence of the magnetization above $H_{c1}$ is accounted for by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction terms. The low-energy spin dynamics (fluctuations), measured by the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$, confirms the continuity of this phase and the absence of any low-temperature phase transition. Unexpectedly, the spin dynamics above $H_{c1}$ is largely dominated by two-magnon processes, which is expected above the saturation field of a spin-nematic phase, but not inside. This shows that BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$ is indeed close to a spin-nematic instability; however, this phase is not stabilized. We thus confirm recent theoretical predictions that the spin-nematic phase can be stabilized, at most, in an extremely narrow field range close to saturation or is rather narrowly avoided [Jiang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 116701 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Efficient construction of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional as matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method has become a very competitive numerical method for studying the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity problems. For small impurities, the most challenging calculation in TEMPO is to construct the matrix product state representation of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. In this work we propose an efficient method for this task, which exploits the time-translationally invariant property of the influence functional. The required number of matrix product state multiplication in our method is almost independent of the total evolution time, as compared to the method originally used in TEMPO which requires a linearly scaling number of multiplications. The accuracy and efficiency of this method are demonstrated for the Toulouse model and the single impurity Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Solving quantum impurity problems on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The path integral formalism is the building block of many powerful numerical methods for quantum impurity problems. However, existing fermionic path integral based numerical calculations have only been performed in either the imaginary-time or the real-time axis, while the most generic scenario formulated on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour is left unexplored. In this work, we extended the recently developed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method to solve quantum impurity problems directly on the Kadanoff-Baym contour. The resulting method is numerically exact, with only two sources of numerical errors, e.g., the time discretization error and the matrix product state bond truncation error, which can both be well controlled. The accuracy of this method is numerically demonstrated against exact solutions in the noninteracting case, and against existing calculations on the real- and imaginary-time axes for the single-orbital Anderson impurity model. Our method is a perfect benchmarking baseline for its alternatives which often employ less-controlled approximations, and can also be used as a real-time impurity solver in dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.</description>

      <title>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with the same Hall conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe_2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance and broken translational symmetry has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Resonances involving integer magnons and spin-1/2 excitations in a magnetism modulated two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct an experimental study of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells modulated by strong magnetism at an in-plane magnetic field ($B$). The modulated $B$-fields are performed via the single stripe and gratings which are made of the heavy rare earth metal Terbium (Tb) thin films on the sample surface. The robust ferromagnetic resonances (FMRs) persist to the temperature of 50-70 K in both the stripe and grating samples, for the ferromagnetism (FM) phase of Tb exists at above 100 K. The high-order (with integer numbers of $j \equiv \hbar\omega/g\mu_{B}B = 1, 2,$...) magnetic resonances can also be observed in the stripe structure via the microwave (MW) photovoltaic detection and magnetoresistance under microwave irradiation. In addition, the resonance features around $j = 1/2$ are robust in the single-stripe modulated sample, which suggests the spinons with spin-1/2 collective excitations in a 1D Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Trilayer multi-orbital models of $\mathrm{La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) $\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ under pressure has further expanded the realm of nickelate-based superconductor family. In this paper, we performed a first-principle study of $\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ for both $P2_1/a$ phase at ambient pressure and $I4/mmm$ phase at high pressure, with $U$=0, 3.5\ eV. Our results confirmed the characteristic upward shift of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ bonding band under pressure. Moreover, our analysis of electronic spectrum and orbital occupancy unveil the dynamic mechanism of electronic reconstructions under pressure, embedded in a critical dual effect. Based on our results, we further proposed a trilayer two-orbital model by performing Wannier downfolding on Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. Our model reveals four Fermi surface sheets with $\alpha,\beta,\beta^\prime,\gamma$ pockets, bearing resemblance to that of bilayer $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$. According to the model, our calculated spin susceptibility under random phase approximation shows that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is also important for the magnetic fluctuation in RP series. Finally, a high energy sixteen-orbital model with direct $dp,pp$ hoppings is proposed, which implies that $\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ also lies in charge-transfer picture within Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen scheme. Our exposition of electronic reconstructions and multi-orbital models shed light on theoretical electronic correlation study and experimental exploration of lower pressure superconductor in RP series.</description>

      <title>Conformal field theory with composite defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore higher-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) in the presence of a conformal defect that itself hosts another sub-dimensional defect. We refer to this new kind of conformal defect as the composite defect. We elaborate on the various conformal properties of the composite defect CFTs, including correlation functions, operator expansions, and conformal block expansions. As an example, we present a free O(N) vector model in the presence of a composite defect. Assuming the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) does hold even for the defect systems, we conclude that some boundary conditions can be excluded. Our investigations shed light on the rich phenomenology arising from hierarchical defect structures, paving the way for a deeper understanding of critical phenomena in nature.</description>

      <title>Competing anisotropies in the chiral cubic magnet Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ unveiled by resonant x-ray magnetic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cubic $\beta$-Mn-type alloy Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ is a chiral helimagnet that exhibits a peculiar temperature-dependent behavior in the spiral pitch, which decreases from 130 nm at room temperature to 70 nm below 20 K. Notably, this shortening is also accompanied by a structural transition of the metastable skyrmion texture, transforming from a hexagonal lattice to a square lattice of elongated skyrmions. The underlying mechanism of these transformations remain unknown, with interactions potentially involved including temperature-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and exchange anisotropy. Here, x-ray resonant magnetic small-angle scattering in vectorial magnetic fields was employed to investigate the temperature dependence of the anisotropic properties of the helical phase in Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$. Our results reveal quantitatively that the magnitude of the anisotropic exchange interaction increases by a factor of 4 on cooling from room temperature to 20 K, leading to a 5% variation in the helical pitch within the (001) plane at 20 K. While anisotropic exchange interaction contributes to the shortening of the spiral pitch, its magnitude is insufficient to explain the variation in the spiral periodicity from room to low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that magnetocrystalline and exchange anisotropies compete, favoring different orientations of the helical vector in the ground state.</description>
