      <title>Spin and orbital Hall effect in non-magnetic transition metals: extrinsic vs intrinsic contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kubo's linear response formalism has been used to calculate the orbital Hall conductivity (OHC) for non-magnetic undoped and doped transition metal systems, focusing on the impact of different types of disorder and the role of vertex corrections for the OHC. The doping- and temperature-dependence of the OH conductivity have been investigated and compared with corresponding results for the spin Hall conductivity (SHC). A strong difference has been found between the results for undoped and doped metallic systems. For elemental systems at finite temperature a dominating role of the intrinsic contribution to the temperature-dependent OH and SH conductivities is found. Moreover, the different temperature dependent behavior of the intrinsic SOC-independent OHC and SOC-driven SCH indicates a non-trivial relationship between these quantities. It is shown, that in contrast to the intrinsic part of the OH and SH conductivities, the extrinsic contributions in doped systems are determined by spin-orbit coupling for both of them. It is dominating at low temperature, strongly decreasing at higher temperatures due to the increasing impact of the electron-phonon scattering.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial synthesis and characterization of thin film Al1-xRExN (RE = Pr3+, Tb3+) heterostructural alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential impact of cation-substituted AlN-based materials, such as Al1-xScxN, Al1-xGaxN, and Al1-xBxN, with exceptional electronic, electromechanical, and dielectric properties has spurred research into this broad family of materials. Rare earth (RE) cations are particularly appealing as they could additionally impart optoelectronic or magnetic functionality. However, success in incorporating a significant level of RE cations into AlN has been limited so far because it is thermodynamically challenging to stabilize such heterostructural alloys. Using combinatorial co-sputtering, we synthesized Al1-xRExN (RE = Pr, Tb) thin films and performed a rapid survey of the composition-structure-property relationships as a function of RE alloying. Under our growth conditions, we observe that Al1-xPrxN maintains a phase-pure wurtzite structure until transitioning to amorphous for x&gt;0.22. Al1-xTbxN exhibits a phase-pure wurtzite structure until x&lt;0.15, then exhibits mixed wurtzite and rocksalt phases for 0.16&lt;x&lt;0.28, and finally becomes amorphous beyond that. Ellipsometry measurements reveal that the absorption onset decreases with increasing rare earth incorporation and has a strong dependence on the phases present. We observe the characteristic cathodoluminescence emission of Pr3+ and Tb3+, respectively. Using this synthesis approach, we have demonstrated incorporation of Pr and Tb into the AlN wurtzite structure up to higher compositions levels than previously reported and made the first measurements of corresponding structural and optoelectronic properties.</description>

      <title>Topological Charge Quadrupole Protected by Spin-Orbit U(1) Quasi-Symmetry in Antiferromagnet NdBiPt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in crystal solids has given rise to various elementary excitations as quasiparticles. Among these, those with significant Berry-phase-related transport responses are of particular interest. Here, we predict a new type of quasiparticle called topological charge quadruple (TCQ), which is analogous to a charge quadrupole but consists of two closely-packed pairs of Weyl points in momentum space, specifically in a half-Heusler antiferromagnet NdBiPt. Interestingly, the TCQ is protected by the spin-orbit $U(1)$ quasi-symmetry, rather than any exact crystallographic symmetries. This quasi-symmetry restricts the energy splitting induced by symmetry-lowering perturbations to a second-order effect. Furthermore, the closely located Berry curvature sources and sinks in the TCQ lead to a large Berry curvature dipole, resulting in a significant nonlinear Hall effect. Our work opens an avenue for designing novel quasiparticles using quasi-symmetries and developing materials with enhanced nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Free Standing Epitaxial Oxides Through Remote Epitaxy: The Role of the Evolving Graphene Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote epitaxy has garnered considerable attention as a promising method that facilitates the growth of thin films that replicate the crystallographic characteristics of a substrate by utilizing two-dimensional (2D) material interlayers like graphene. The resulting film can be exfoliated to form a freestanding membrane, and the substrate, if expensive, can be reused. However, atomically thin 2-D materials are susceptible to damage before and during film growth in the chamber, leading to a poor epitaxy. Oxide remote epitaxy using graphene, the most commonly available 2D material, is particularly challenging because the conventional conditions employed for the growth of epitaxial oxides also degrade graphene. In this study, we show for the first time that a direct correlation exists between the microstructure of graphene, its getting defective on exposure to the pulsed laser deposition plume, and the crystalline quality of the barium titanate film deposited on top. A controlled aperture method was used to reduce graphene damage. Even so, the degree of damage is more at the graphene grain boundaries than within the grains. Large grain-sized greater than 300 microns, graphene suffered less damage and yielded a film comparable to that grown directly on a strontium titanate substrate with a rocking curve half width of 0.6 degrees. Using large grain-sized bi-layer graphene, 4 mm x 5 mm oxide layers were successfully exfoliated and transferred onto SiOx-Si. These insights pave the way for the heterogeneous integration of functional oxides on foreign substrates, holding significant implications for commercializing perovskite oxides by integrating them with Si-CMOS and flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Sb2Se3 and SbBiSe3 Surface Capping and Biaxial Strain Co-Engineering for Tuning the Surface Electronic Properties of Bi2Se3 Nanosheet- A Density Functional Theory based Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, for the first time, a density functional theory (DFT) based comprehensive theoretical study is performed on the surface electronic properties of Bi2Se3 nanosheet in the presence of a surface capping layer as well as mechanical strain. The study systematically introduces a biaxial compressive and tensile strain up to 5% in natural, Sb2Se3 surface capped, and SbBiSe3 surface capped Bi2Se3, and the subsequent effects on the electronic properties are assessed from the surface energy band (E-k) structure, the density of states (DOS), band edge energy and bandgap variations, surface conducting state localization, and Fermi surface spin-textures. The key findings of this work are systematically analyzed from conducting surface state hybridization through bulk in the presence of surface capping layers and applied biaxial strain. The result demonstrates that the interplay of surface capping and strain can simultaneously tune the surface electronic structure, spin-momentum locking results from change in electronic localization and interactions. In essence, this work presents an extensive theoretical and design-level insight into the surface capping and biaxial strain co-engineering in Bi2Se3, which can potentially facilitate different topological transport for modern optoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics, bulk photovoltaics applications of engineered nanostructured topological materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Role of host/guest coupling in stabilizing the phases of the over-tolerant hybrid perovskite MHyPbX3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $MHyPbBr_xCl_{3-x}$ exhibits an interesting temperature-induced phase diagram transitioning from monoclinic (Phase-II) to orthorhombic (Phase-I) and eventually to the high-temperature disordered cubic phase. However, experimental observations indicate the absence of either the cubic or orthorhombic phases in compositions with x=0 (chloride) and x=3 (bromide), respectively. We explain the composition dependence of the phase transition sequence in MHyPbX3 (X = Cl, Br) from the perspective of a host/guest framework for the system. We argue that the sequence of phase transitions in MHyPbX3 can be anticipated based on the competition between host distortion and host/guest coupling energies. A dominant coupling in MHyPbCl3 ensures the stabilization of the intermediate Phase-I while pushing the transition to cubic phase beyond its decomposition temperature. On the other hand, a balance of the energy scales in MHyPbBr3 suppresses Phase-I and stabilizes the cubic phase. Our expectations were supported by first-principles based estimates of the transition temperatures in both compounds, which yield trends in agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the cubic phase of MHyPbBr3 results from a disorder over locally orthorhombic structures, a clear manifestation of the balance of energy scales. We propose that the same concept can be employed to predict the stable phases in other hybrid perovskites.</description>

      <title>Coexisting polarization mechanisms in ferroelectric uniaxial tetragonal tungsten bronze Ca_0.3Ba_0.7Nb_2O_6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a broad band dielectric spectroscopy approach (1 to 10^14 Hz) we prove that the tungsten bronze Ca0.3Ba0.7Nb2O6 (CBN-30) displays a ferroelectric phase transition of mixed displacive and order-disorder character, and its paraelectric phase does not show traces of relaxor behaviour but precursor effects as polar fluctuations below about 550 K. The analysis of the sub-MHz dielectric response together with infrared and Raman spectroscopy reveals that simultaneous polarization mechanisms are responsible for the phase transition. The comparison of the excitations found in CBN-30 with those of (Sr,Ba)Nb2O6 reveals that these mechanisms are congruous, although in CBN-30 the main relaxation process behaves differently due to the different domain structure. The excitations are phenomenologically assigned to phonons, to an anharmonic vibration of cationic origin which plays the role of a soft central mode, and to a relaxation in the GHz range probably due to polarization fluctuations of nanometric size which carries the main part of the permittivity and splits below TC into several weaker excitations with different polarization correlation lengths. The overall dielectric response is therefore explained by the coexistence of several excitations with different thermal behaviors, corroborating the complexity of the tetragonal tungsten bronze structures.</description>

      <title>Low Thermal Resistance of Diamond-AlGaN Interfaces Achieved Using Carbide Interlayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates thermal transport across nanocrystalline diamond/AlGaN interfaces, crucial for enhancing thermal management in AlGaN/AlGaN-based devices. Chemical vapor deposition growth of diamond directly on AlGaN resulted in a disordered interface with a high thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of 20.6 m^2-K/GW. We employed sputtered carbide interlayers (e.g., $B_4C$, $SiC$, $B_4C/SiC$) to reduce thermal boundary resistance in diamond/AlGaN interfaces. The carbide interlayers resulted in record-low thermal boundary resistance values of 3.4 and 3.7 m^2-K/GW for Al$_{0.65}$Ga$_{0.35}$N samples with $B_4C$ and $SiC$ interlayers, respectively. STEM imaging of the interface reveals interlayer thicknesses between 1.7-2.5 nm, with an amorphous structure. Additionally, Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) characterization of sections of the STEM images displayed sharp crystalline fringes in the AlGaN layer, confirming it was properly protected from damage from hydrogen plasma during the diamond growth. In order to accurately measure the thermal boundary resistance we develop a hybrid technique, combining time-domain thermoreflectance and steady-state thermoreflectance fitting, offering superior sensitivity to buried thermal resistances. Our findings underscore the efficacy of interlayer engineering in enhancing thermal transport and demonstrate the importance of innovative measurement techniques in accurately characterizing complex thermal interfaces. This study provides a foundation for future research in improving thermal properties of semiconductor devices through interface engineering and advanced measurement methodologies.</description>

      <title>Structural Diversity in Condensed Matter: A General Characterization of Crystals, Amorphous Solids and the Structures Between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A definition of structural diversity, adapted from the biodiversity literature, is introduced to provide a general characterization of structures of condensed matter. Using the Favored Local Structure (FLS) lattice model as a testbed, the diversity measure is found to effectively filter extrinsic noise and to provide a useful differentiation between crystal and amorphous structures. We identify an interesting class of structures intermediate between crystals and glasses that are characterised by a complex combination of short-range ordering and long-range disorder. We demonstrate how the diversity can be used as an order parameter to organise various scenarios by structure change in response to increasing diversity.</description>

      <title>Response of any arbitrary initially stressed reference and the stress-free reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constitutive relation for an initially stressed reference is often determined using the response of a virtual stress-free reference. However, it is usually difficult to identify the constitutive relation of the associated stress-free reference, without performing a destructive testing. In this paper, we introduce three approaches to determine the response of the stress-free, or any arbitrary initially stressed reference, using the response of a given initially stressed reference. The first and third approaches directly find out the constitutive relations for one stressed reference from another. The second approach uses the response of a given stressed reference, to identify the stress-free material, and thereafter determines the response of any stressed reference. Quite interestingly, it appears that the stress-free material, or the arbitrarily stressed references, can be implicit, although the given (known) initially stressed state is Green elastic. We also obtain a few simple cases of explicit constitutive relations. These approaches of changing the reference configuration do not begin from the stress-free state. Using the present framework and the concept of symmetry, we also explore the dependence or independence of constitutive relation on the choice of reference. The present work also develops the universal relations for stress-free isotropic implicit elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Application of the Two-Electron Quantum Theory of Glass States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The glass state problem stems from the failure described in terms of one-electron theory or atoms (molecules) as independent particles. In 2005, de Gennes proposed that the way to explain the glass transition in simple terms was to construct the cluster model of molecules in contact with all existing glass models and to refine the picture of the mean-field hard-sphere molecules (HSMs) in contact with each other. In the process of refining this picture, we discovered the two-electron quantum theory derived from the second solution of de Gennes n = 0, where the clustered contact of the two HSMs along the z-axis is the sequential emergence of the 16 z-direction interface excited quantum states of their coupled electron pair, the two HSMs suddenly overlap by 0.27% to form a magic-interface two-dimensional vector. The two coupled electron orbitals synchronously escaped the two HSMs 16 times, tangent to the magic interface 16 times, and 16 parallel repulsive electron pairs with an interval of 5.9987{\deg}, which is a clustered boson interaction between the two HSMs. This is the common origin of boson peaks in the glass state and electron pairing in the high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore, the collective behavior of electrons in the two-electron theory can unify the glass transition and the high-temperature superconducting transition. This paper is not only a complete theoretical statement on glass transition, but also a new interpretation of the theory of high-temperature superconductivity, which provides a new theoretical perspective in the search for room-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of hydrogen on the local chemical bonding states and structure of amorphous alumina by atomistic and electrostatic modeling of Auger parameter shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study discloses the effect of hydrogen impurities on the local chemical bonding states and structure of amorphous alumina films by predicting measured Auger parameter shifts using a combination of atomistic and electrostatic modeling. Different amorphous alumina polymorphs with variable H-content and density, as grown by atomic layer deposition, were successfully modeled using a universal machine learning interatomic potential. The annealing of highly defective crystalline hydroxide structures with experimental H-contents at the corresponding atomic layer deposition temperatures led to excellent agreement between theory and experiment in the density and structure of the resulting amorphous alumina polymorphs. The measured Auger parameter shifts of Al cations in such polymorphs were accurately predicted with respect to the H content by assuming that all H atoms are present in the form of hydroxyl ligands in the randomly interconnected 4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold nearest-coordination spheres of Al. As revealed by a combination of atomistic and electrostatic modeling, the measured Auger shifts with an increase in the H content and an accompanying decrease in the oxide density depend on the complex correlations between local coordination, bond lengths, bond angles, and ligand type(s) around the core-ionized atoms. Moreover, cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is suggested to offer new insights into the local chemical and structural building blocks of crystalline and amorphous oxides by reducing thermal noise. These findings and fundamental knowledge contribute to advancing the design of e.g. hydrogen oxide barrier films, oxide membranes for H separation, H storage materials, and fuel cells for a hydrogen-based economy.</description>

      <title>Tunable polar distortions and magnetism in Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$PtSb epitaxial films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal $ABC$ intermetallics are predicted to have tunable ferroelectric, topological, and magnetic properties as a function of the polar buckling of $BC$ atomic planes. We report the impact of isovalent lanthanide substitution on the buckling, structural phase transitions, and electronic and magnetic properties of Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$PtSb films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on c-plane sapphire substrates. The Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$PtSb films form a solid solution from x = 0 to 1 and retain the polar hexagonal structure ($P6_3 mc$) out to $x \leq 0.95$. With increasing $x$, the PtSb buckling increases and the out of plane lattice constant $c$ decreases due to the lanthanide contraction. While hexagonal LaPtSb is a highly conductive polar metal, the carrier density decreases with $x$ until an abrupt phase transition to a zero band overlap semimetal is found for cubic GdPtSb at $x=1$. The magnetic susceptibility peaks at small but finite $x$, which we attribute to Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) coupling between localized $4f$ moments, whose concentration increases with $x$, and free carriers that decrease with $x$. Samples with $x\geq 0.3$ show antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss behavior and a Neel temperature that increases with $x$. The Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$PtSb system provides opportunities to dramatically alter the polar buckling and concentration of local $4f$ moments, for tuning chiral spin textures and topological phases.</description>

      <title>Perfect superconducting diode effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate intrinsic superconducting diode effect in the unconventional superconducting state of $d$-wave altermagnets. We find large diode efficiencies in the wide-reaching finite-momentum pairing regimes of the phase diagram. Remarkably, even perfect diode efficiency of 100% can be obtained in the presence of an external magnetic field. We attribute the largest efficiencies to competition between multiple zero-momentum (BCS) and finite-momentum superconducting states, which is connected to a topological nodal-to-nodeless transition in altermagnets with magnetic field, making our results applicable to a wide range of altermagnets.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Quantum Valley Hall Effect with Quantized Resistance and a Topological Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge states of a topological insulator can be used to explore fundamental science emerging at the interface of low dimensionality and topology. Achieving a robust conductance quantization, however, has proven challenging for helical edge states. Here we show wide resistance plateaus in kink states - a manifestation of the quantum valley Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene - quantized to the predicted value at zero magnetic field. The plateau resistance has a very weak temperature dependence up to 50 Kelvin and is flat within a dc bias window of tens of mV. We demonstrate the electrical operation of a topology-controlled switch with an on/off ratio of 200. These results demonstrate the robustness and tunability of the kink states and its promise in constructing electron quantum optics devices.</description>

      <title>Coupling between electrons and charge density wave fluctuation and its possible role in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most of charge density wave (CDW) systems of different material classes, ranging from traditional correlated systems in low-dimension to recent topological systems with Kagome lattice, superconductivity emerges when the system is driven toward the quantum critical point (QCP) of CDW via external parameters of doping and pressure. Despite this rather universal trend, the essential hinge between CDW and superconductivity has not been established yet. Here, the evidence of coupling between electron and CDW fluctuation is reported, based on a temperature- and intercalation-dependent kink in the angle-resolved photoemission spectra of 2H-PdxTaSe2. Kinks are observed only when the system is in the CDW phase, regardless of whether a long- or short-range order is established. Notably, the coupling strength is enhanced upon long-range CDW suppression, albeit the coupling energy scale is reduced. Interestingly, estimation of the superconducting critical temperature by incorporating the observed coupling characteristics into McMillan's equation yields result closely resembling the known values of the superconducting dome. Our results thus highlight a compelling possibility that this new coupling mediates Cooper pairs, which provides new insights on the competing relationship not only for CDW, but also for other competing orders.</description>

      <title>Prediction of NMR Parameters and geometry in 133Cs-containing compounds using Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need to immobilize low-level nuclear waste, in particular 137Cs-bearing waste, has led to a growing interest in geopolymer-based waste matrices, in addition to optimization attempts of cement matrix compositions for this specific application. Although the overall phase composition and structure of these matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these materials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that combining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to the local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights into the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can provide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric properties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the choice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR surrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark various functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of various simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and their chemical shift values. The results show rev-vdW-DF2 to be a leading, though not a flawless, candidate for these systems, and apparently for additional classes of Cs-containing systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional superconductivity in a thick exfoliated kagome film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of two-dimensional superconductivity (2D SC) in exfoliated kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with a thickness far thicker than the atomic limit. By examining the critical current and upper critical magnetic fields ($H_{c2}$) of 40-60 nm thick films in the superconducting state, we identify a pronounced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition behavior, i.e. a drastic decrease of the superfluid stiffness near the transition, and a cusp-like feature of the angular dependent $H_{c2}$, both of which serve as direct evidence of 2D SC. In addition, an exceeding of the Pauli paramagnetic limit of the in-plane $H_{c2}$ is consistent with the 2D SC nature. The observed 2D SC occurs in thick films with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the lowest charge density wave transition temperature $T_{\rm {CDW}}$, which suggests that the charge density wave states are interrelated with the superconducting states. Our findings impose constraints in understanding the enhancement of SC in kagome superconductors, and illuminate pathways for achieving novel 2D superconducting states in more stable and much thicker systems.</description>

      <title>Defects Enhance Stability in 12-fold Symmetric Soft-Matter Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are materials that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity. In soft matter, the most commonly observed quasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares and triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings nearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an additional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus defects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the critical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-mechanics of parachute fabrics under tensile loads is studied using in situ X-ray micro-tomography. Results are presented for two nylon textiles commonly used in parachute systems, MIL-C-7020H Type III and MIL-C-44378(GL) Type II. Textiles are subjected to incremental tension using a custom apparatus that loads the fabric radially, and the microstructure is imaged sequentially at steady load conditions. Micro-tomography images are processed using learning-aided segmentation and a custom processing pipeline that tracks the locations and morphological properties of individual tows on 3-D datasets. Results are used to reconstruct tow micro-scale properties and meso-scale strains. Our findings reveal a direct relation between the fabric architecture and the meso-scale mechanics. Warp tow pretensioning during manufacturing is found to affect decrimping and the anisotropy of the textile strains. Areal porosity increase with tension is quantified and a geometric model for pore opening under incremental load is validated.</description>

      <title>Influence of Point Defects on Laser-Induced Excitation in Silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the influence of defect states on the laser excitation process in silicon using time-dependent density functional theory. We assumed two types of point defects: interstitial oxygen and silicon vacancies. We found that the photoabsorption efficiency increased with defect density in both cases owing to the color center. These defects distorted the crystal structure, thereby relaxing the selection rules and changing the indirect gap to direct. At low laser intensities, the defect states dominated the absorption process. However, as the laser intensity increased, the excitation efficiency approached that of crystalline silicon. In addition, we observed that the excitation efficiency did not scale linearly with the pulse length. Notably, in the case of Si vacancies, saturable absorption significantly reduced photoabsorption. Our results suggest that the existence of a defect and its density could be detected by even-order high-harmonics generation.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) was experimentally observed for the first time in antimony polyhydride. The diamond anvil cell combined with laser heating system was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and high temperature conditions. In-situ high pressure transport measurements as function of temperature with applied magnet are performed to study the SC properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show superconducting transition with critical temperature $T_c = 116^\circ$K at 184 GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed that the superconducting coherent length ~40 angstroms based on Ginzburg Landau (GL) equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest Tc in addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main group IIIA to VIIA in periodic table.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforcing neural networks with applications to constitutive modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning techniques to homogenize the effective behavior of arbitrary microstructures has been shown to be not only efficient but also accurate. In a recent work, we demonstrated how to combine state-of-the-art micromechanical modeling and advanced machine learning techniques to homogenize complex microstructures exhibiting non-linear and history dependent behaviors (Logarzo et al., 2021). The resulting homogenized model, termed smart constitutive law (SCL), enables the adoption of microstructurally informed constitutive laws into finite element solvers at a fraction of the computational cost required by traditional concurrent multiscale approaches. In this work, the capabilities of SCLs are expanded via the introduction of a novel methodology that enforces material symmetries at the neuron level, applicable across various neural network architectures. This approach utilizes tensor-based features in neural networks, facilitating the concise and accurate representation of symmetry-preserving operations, and is general enough to be extend to problems beyond constitutive modeling. Details on the construction of these tensor-based neural networks and their application in learning constitutive laws are presented for both elastic and inelastic materials. The superiority of this approach over traditional neural networks is demonstrated in scenarios with limited data and strong symmetries, through comprehensive testing on various materials, including isotropic neo-Hookean materials and tensegrity lattice metamaterials. This work is concluded by a discussion on the potential of this methodology to discover symmetry bases in materials and by an outline of future research directions.</description>

Abstract: We predict the emergence a state of matter with intertwined ferromagnetism, charge order and topology in fractionally filled moir\'e superlattice bands. Remarkably, these quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibit a quantized integer Hall conductance that is different than expected from the filling and Chern number of the band. Microscopic calculations show that this phase is robustly favored at half-filling ($\nu=1/2$) at larger twist angles of the twisted semiconductor bilayer $t$MoTe$_2$</description>

      <title>Effect of particle oxidation, size and material on deformation, bonding and deposition during cold spray: a peridynamic investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold spray (CS) has emerged as an important additive manufacturing technology over the past decade. This study investigates the effect of oxide layers on the CS process, focusing on the deformation behavior of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) particles upon collision with a matching substrate. Using a peridynamics-based approach, we examine the effects of oxide thickness, particle size, and particle/substrate material on material deformation and oxide fracture processes. Our results show that thicker oxide films restrict particle deformation, delay oxide discontinuities and material jetting, and increase the critical velocity required for metal to metal contact. Larger particles, despite uniform deformation across sizes, require lower velocities to initiate jetting and oxide separation because of their higher kinetic energy, leading to metallurgical bonding at lower velocities. Soft to soft impacts induce oxide film cracking at lower velocities, resulting in larger interface areas and more oxide-free contact zones, thereby reducing the critical velocity. Furthermore, the volume of residual oxide has a power-law relationship with the particle size, indicating that the oxide-cleaning ability of the particles affects the critical velocity. This study highlights the importance of oxide deformation and fracture during CS processes and provides valuable insights into the breakage and removal of oxides and subsequent metallic bond formation. These findings offer beneficial new knowledge for the rational design and optimization of CS processes.</description>

      <title>Triboelectric Pixels as building blocks for microscale and large area integration of drop energy harvesters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultimate step towards the exploitation of water as a clean and renewable energy source addresses the energies stored in the low frequencies of liquid flows, which demands flexible solutions to adapt to multiple scenarios, from raindrops to waves, including water moving in pipelines and microdevices. Thus, harvesting low-frequency flows is a young concept compared to solar and wind powers, where triboelectric nanogenerators have been revealed as the most promising relevant actors. However, despite widespread attempts by researchers, the drop energy harvesters' output power is still low, mainly because of the limitations in candidates endowed with ideal triboelectric and wetting properties and also the non-optimal and centimetre-scale device architecture that prevents the conversion of the complete kinetic energy of impinging drops. Herein, we disclose a microscale triboelectric nanogenerator that can harvest a high density of electrical power from drops through a single, submillisecond, long-lasting step. The mechanism relies on an instantaneous electrical capacitance variation owing to the high-speed contact of the drops with the electrodes' active area. We discuss the role of the precharged effect of the triboelectric surface in the time characteristic of the conversion event. The capacitive and microscale structure of the device is endowed with a small form factor that allows for the production of densely packed arrays. The proposed architecture can be adjusted to different liquids and scales and is compatible with a variety of triboelectric surfaces, including flexible, transparent, and thin-film approaches.</description>
