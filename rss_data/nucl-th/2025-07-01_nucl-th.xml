      <title>Suppression of genuine tripartition in heavy nuclei: A self-consistent perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ternary fissions of $^{252}$Cf (spontaneous) and $^{236}$U (neutron-induced) into medium-mass fragments, as reported by the Dubna group, using the Hartree-Fock plus BCS method with the SLy6 Skyrme interaction. Compared to microscopic-macroscopic methods used so far, this self-consistent approach provides a greater flexibility of nuclear shapes.
  Our working hypothesis is that the shape evolution proceeds while the system is still mononuclear. The results show that a ternary fission valley emerges for intermediate elongations of the middle fragment, only when its mass is strongly constrained. This ternary mode is dynamically suppressed by the competition with the dominant binary decay channel. This suggests that a description based solely on quantum tunneling through the energy barrier is insufficient to evaluate its probability.
  To quantify this suppression, we apply a simple Langevin-type model of overdamped motion with constant damping and temperature, supplemented by a basic estimate of quantum tunneling where relevant. Under assumptions expected to yield an upper bound, we find the probability of ternary fission per binary decay to be on the order of $10^{-8}-10^{-9}$ for $^{252}$Cf and $10^{-10}-10^{-11}$ for $^{236}$U.</description>

      <title>Quark Phase Space Distributions in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [PRC 110, 025201], the authors construct a model for nuclear matter which features a quarkyonic phase. A main feature in this model is that the nucleon occupation is strongly reduced at small momenta. Somewhat surprisingly, this result is supported by data for electron scattering from nuclear matter, where a reduction of the cross section consistent with suppression of nucleons with small momenta is seen. Since nuclear matter data are obtained by extrapolation of electron scattering data on increasingly heavier systems, this feature should manifest at least to some degree in heavy nuclei. To check if this is plausible we extend the approach of [PRC 110, 025201] to finite nuclei by considering the nuclear Wigner distribution. We use non-relativistic and relativistic independent particle models to determine the nuclear Wigner distribution, in addition to the local-density approximation (LDA). Phase-space distributions of quarks are obtained as a convolution of the Wigner distribution with a quark momentum distribution. We highlight some properties of the Wigner distribution in spherical systems, which can spoil the interpretation of the quark phase-space distribution as occupation numbers in the Fermi sea. On the other hand, we show that large systems behave essentially like infinite nuclear matter in their interior, and that LDA and full results are quantitatively similar for large A. We then compute the fraction of baryons that would be in a quarkyonic phase in the same sense as in [PRC 110, 025201] for a set of nuclei with mass $12 \leq A \leq 238$. We find that this fraction systematically tends to a constant at large $A$. It is hence plausible that the suppression seen in the nuclear matter data is a genuine feature, present in large finite nuclei. This result is counter-intuitive and we discuss possible electron scattering measurements that could rule out this model.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of charged hadrons in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the elliptic flow coefficient, $v_2$, for charged hadrons at mid-rapidity in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$. Utilizing the AMPT model in both default and string melting modes, we examine the dependence of $v_2$ on transverse momentum, collision centrality, and particle type. Furthermore, we present $v_2$ scaled by participant eccentricity, which indicates a similar level of collectivity across different centrality intervals in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$ within the AMPT-SM model. Our results indicate that the early-stage partonic phase significantly influences $v_2$, as observed by variations in parton scattering cross-section, while the later stage hadronic rescattering shows minimal impact. Comparisons with STAR and PHENIX experimental data show that the AMPT model effectively captures the transverse momentum dependence of $v_2$, underlining the importance of parton scattering mechanisms and the need for careful interpretation of experimental results in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>On scaling factor for $^{28}$Si + $^{12}$C charge-changing cross sections at 90-1296 MeV/nucleon: Toward finding energy-dependent scaling factor for other elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the detailed study of the scaling factor for $^{28}$\rm Si + $^{12}$\rm C charge-changing cross sections (CCCSs) at 90-1296 MeV/nucleon, we introduced a new approach to find the systematic energy dependence of the scaling factor that can be used to predict the CCCSs for other elements. The analysis considers the study of charge-changing cross sections for $^{7,9-12,14}$\rm Be, $^{10-15,17}$\rm B, $^{12-19}$\rm C, $^{14,15,,17-22}$\rm N, $^{16,18-24}$\rm O, $^{18-21,23-26}$\rm F, and $^{42-51}$\rm Ca isotopes at 200-930 MeV/nucleon in the framework of the Glauber model. The calculations involve descriptions of nuclei in terms of the Slater determinant using harmonic oscillator single-particle wave functions. The extracted values of the scaling factor are found to provide satisfactory account of the experimental data in all the cases, except for $^{42-51}$\rm Ca isotopes where the calculated values differ significantly from the measured values. In the case of \rm Ca isotopes, however, we find that inclusion of the phase variation of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering amplitude, which is the basic input of the Glauber model, is able to provide an alternative way to serve the purpose of (phenomenological) scaling, and one gets systematically quite a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experiment. Additionally, the present work for finding the scaling factor may find its place to (i) investigate the suitability of the calculated proton radii of the exotic nuclei, given in the literature, and (ii) provide the reliable estimate for the CCCSs of those isotopes of a given element whose calculated charge radii are known, but their experimental CCCSs are not available.</description>

      <title>Quarks in Hadrons and Nuclei Part 1: Quark Structure of Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a semi-empirical quark model of nucleon structure, so-called, Strongly Correlated Quark Model, SCQM, which possess the features of both non-relativistic and relativistic quark models. Based on SU(3) color symmetry it includes the main features of QCD: local gauge invariance, asymptotic freedom, and chiral symmetry breaking. This First Part of the paper is devoted to description of the model, SCQM, and in the forthcoming Second Part we will apply the model to built the nuclear structure. Applied to nuclei, it reveals emergence of the face-centered cubic (FCC) symmetry of the nuclear structure.This symmetry arise from quark-quark correlations leading, in turn, to nucleon-nucleon correlations.</description>

      <title>Half-life of $^{136}$Xe for neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay calculated with effective axial-vector current coupling unified for two-neurtino and neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper limit on the mass of the Majorana neutrino, extracted from the limits on the nonobservation of the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, is hampered by uncertainties in the matrix elements of the transition operators. Recently, we have shown that the values of the effective axial-vector current coupling constants ($g_A^\mathrm{eff}$) for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decays are close. This striking result was obtained for the first time by including vertex corrections and two-body currents in these matrix elements. In this letter, we calculate the half-life for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay ($T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$) of $^{136}$Xe using this closeness and show the convergence of the half-life with respect to the variation of the method to determine $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$. The closeness of the $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ of the two decay modes plays a decisive role in predicting $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$. The appropriate value of $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ depends on the calculation method, and $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ is close to one in our perturbation calculation.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of correlators for quarkonium decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there has been a lot of progress in developing a
  formalism for the study of quarkonia in QGP, a nonperturbative
  study is still difficult. For bottomonia, where the system size
  is much less than the inverse temperature, the interaction of the
  system with the medium can be approximated by a dipole interaction with
  the color electric field. The decay of the quarkonia can be connected to
  a correlation function of the color electric field.
  We present preliminary results from a lattice study of the relevant color
  electric field correlator. The structure of the correlator, and its
  difference from the corresponding correlator studied for heavy quark
  diffusion, is discussed.</description>

      <title>The diffuse supernova neutrino background: a modern approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Study on Pentaqaurks by Solving Schrodinger Equation in the Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of the charmed baryon and the anticharmed meson is assumed to be realized by exchanging a scalar meson of $f_0(500)$, and then these systems are studied by solving the Schrodinger equation, respectively. When the pentaquarks $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^{+}$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^{+}$, $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4338)^0$, and $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)^{0}$ are treated as $\Sigma_c \bar{D}$, $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^*$, $\Xi_c \bar{D}$ and $\Xi_c \bar{D}^*$ bound states, four resonance states of them are obtained as solutions of the Schrodinger equation under the outgoing wave condition, respectively. The resonance state of $\Sigma_c \bar{D}$ might correspond to the particle $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)^{+}$, while the other three resonance states have no counterparts in the review of the Particle Data Group(PDG). Although the binding energy of the bound state is only several MeVs, all these resonance states are more than 100 MeV higher than their corresponding thresholds, respectively. The calculation results indicate that the spectrums of the strange and non-strange pentaquarks are symmetric to each other.</description>

      <title>A generalized definition of the isothermal compressibility in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized definition of the isothermal compressibility ($\kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}$) calculable by keeping net conserved charge fluctuations rather than total number densities constant. We present lattice QCD results for this isothermal compressibility, expressed in terms of fluctuations of conserved charges that are related to baryon ($B$), electric charge ($Q$) and strangeness ($S$) quantum numbers. This generalized isothermal compressibility is compared with hadron resonance gas model calculations as well as with heavy-ion collision data obtained at RHIC and the LHC. We find $\kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}=13.8(1.3)$~fm$^3$/GeV at $T_{pc,0}=156.5(1.5)$~MeV and $\hat{\mu}_B=0$. This finding is consistent with the rescaled result of the ALICE Collaboration, where we replaced the number of charged hadrons ($N_{\rm ch}$) by the total number of hadrons ($N_{\rm tot}$) at freeze-out. Normalizing this result with the QCD pressure ($P$) we find that the isothermal compressibility on the pseudo-critical line stays close to that of an {\it ideal gas}, {\it i.e.} $P \kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}\simeq 1$.</description>

      <title>Direct proton transfer on $^{46}$Ar supports the presence of a charge density bubble linked to a novel nuclear structure below $^{48}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{46}$Ar($^3$He,d)$^{47}$K reaction was performed in inverse kinematics using a radioactive $^{46}$Ar beam produced by the SPIRAL1 facility at GANIL and a cryogenic $^{3}$He target. The AGATA-MUGAST-VAMOS setup allowed the coincident measurement of the $\gamma$ rays, deuterons and recoiling $^{47}$K isotopes produced by the reaction. The relative cross sections towards the proton-addition states in $^{47}$K point towards a depletion of the $\pi s_{1/2}$ shell. The experimental findings are in good agreement with ab initio calculations, which predict that $^{46}$Ar exhibits a charge density bubble associated with a pronounced proton closed-shell character.</description>

      <title>Collective phenomena in chirally imbalanced medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gluon polarization tensor for a chirally imbalanced plasma using hard thermal loop approximation in the real time formulation of thermal field theory. The dispersion relations obtained from the poles of the effective gluon propagator are solved numerically as well as analytically in appropriate limiting cases. It is seen that the degenerate transverse modes split into left and right handed circularly polarized modes. We also compute imaginary poles of the propagator which signal the presence of instability in the plasma. Relevant time scales for development of such instabilities are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we compute both the real and imaginary parts of the static heavy-quark potential in the chirally imbalanced plasma and argue that quarkonium suppression is enhanced due to the combined effects of a reduced debye screening length and an increased decay width. In addition, we calculate the gluon spectral density, sum rules and residues for various cases, providing a comprehensive understanding of the collective behaviour of the medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the origin of the mass of the nucleon. We first review the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor, which generates most of the nucleon mass via the gluon fields and thus contributes even in the case of vanishing quark masses. We then discuss the contributions to the nucleon mass that do originate from the Higgs mechanism via the quark masses, reviewing the current status of nucleon $\sigma$-terms that encode the corresponding matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Finite Gaussian assistance protocols and a conic metric for extremizing spacelike vacuum entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties ($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements performed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume, defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that remains asymptotically constant with increasing vacuum separation and (2) the lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$ entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum fields.</description>

Abstract: Hadronization is a fundamental process occurring at a distance scale of about $1\,\rm fm \simeq \Lambda_{QCD}^{-1} $, hence within non-perturbative dynamics. In elementary collisions, like $e^+e^-$, $e^-p$, or $pp$, phenomenological approaches to hadronization have been developed based on vacuum-like dynamics that require the creation of quark-antiquark and/or diquark pairs during the hadronization process. In the 2000s, the idea was developed that in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions, which lead to the formation of a partonic medium with large (anti-)quark densities, hadronization can occur through the recombination of in-medium quarks, unlike the situation in $e^+e^-$, $e^-p$, and $pp$. We give an overview of the main features that characterize quark recombination and have enabled a description of several important experimental observables at both RHIC and LHC over the last two decades. We highlight some additional developments and open issues. We specifically discuss the impact of coalescence on the study of heavy-flavor hadronization, including recent developments showing signatures of (the onset of) quark coalescence even in $pp$ collisions at TeV energies. Furthermore, we highlight specific features of hadronization for quarkonium in AA collisions, where it has been possible to develop a dynamical kinetic approach that allows to extract more detailed information about the temperature dependence of the heavy-quark interaction in hot QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Reanalyses for $^{42-51}$Ca scattering on a $^{12}$C target at $280$ MeV/nucleon based on chiral $g$ folding mode with Gogny-D1S Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov densities (published in Results in Physics)</title>

Abstract: In the previous paper, we predicted reaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm R}$ for $^{40-60,62,64}$Ca+$^{12}$C scattering at $280$~MeV/nucleon, since Tanaka {\it el al.} measured interaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm I}$ for $^{42-51}$Ca in RIKEN and determined neutron skin $r_{\rm skin}({\rm RIKEN})$ using the optical limit of the Glauber model with the Woos-Saxon densities. Our purpose is to reanalyze the $r_{\rm skin}$ from the $\sigma_{\rm I}$. Our analysis is superior to theirs, since the chiral $g$-matrix folding model (the GHFB and GHFB+AMP densities) is much better than the optical limit of the Glauber model (the Woos-Saxon densities). Our model is the chiral $g$-matrix folding model with the densities scaled from the GHFB and GHFB+AMP densities. We scale the GHFB and GHFB+AMP densities so that the $\sigma_{\rm R}$ of the scaled densities can agree with the central values of $\sigma_{\rm I}$ under the condition that the proton radius of the scaled proton density equals the data determined from the isotope shift based on the electron scattering. The $r_{\rm skin}$ thus determined are close to their results $r_{\rm skin}^{42-51}({\rm RIKEN})$. For $^{48}$Ca, our value $r_{\rm skin}^{48}$ is 0.105 $\pm$ 0.06~fm, while their value is $r_{\rm m}^{48}({\rm RIKEN})=0.146 \pm 0.06$~fm. We take the weighted mean and its error of $r_{\rm skin}^{48}(\sigma_{\rm I})= 0.105 \pm 0.06$~fm and $r_{\rm skin}^{48}(E1{\rm pE}) =0.17 \pm 0.03$~fm of the high-resolution $E1$ polarizability experiment (E1{\rm pE}). Our final result is $r_{\rm skin}^{48}=0.157 \pm 0.027$~fm. Our conclusion is $r_{\rm skin}^{48}=0.157 \pm 0.027$~fm for $^{48}$Ca. For $^{42-47,49-51}$Ca, our results on $r_{\rm skin}$ are similar to theirs. Our result for $^{48}$Ca is related to CREX.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin thickness of ${}^{208}$Pb determined from reaction cross section for proton scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.02450v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reaction cross section $\sigma_R$ is useful to determine the neutron radius $R_n$ as well as the matter radius $R_m$.
  The chiral (Kyushu) $g$-matrix folding model for $^{12}$C scattering on $^{9}$Be, $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al targets was tested in the incident energy range of $30 \lsim E_{\rm in} \lsim 400 $ MeV, and it is found that the model reliably reproduces the $\sigma_R$ in $30 \lsim E_{\rm in} \lsim 100 $ MeV and $250 \lsim E_{\rm in} \lsim 400$ MeV. \item[Aim]
  We determine $R_n$ and the neutron skin thickness $R_{\rm skin}$ of ${}^{208}{\rm Pb}$ by using high-quality $\sigma_R$ data for the $p+{}^{208}{\rm Pb}$ scattering in $30 \leq E_{\rm in} \leq 100$ MeV.
  The theoretical model is the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model with the densities calculated with Gongny-D1S HFB (GHFB) with the angular momentum projection (AMP). \item[Results]
  The Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model with the GHFB+AMP densities underestimates $\sigma_{\rm R}$ in $30 \leq E_{\rm in} \leq 100$~MeV only by a factor of 0.97.
  Since the proton radius $R_p$ calculated with GHFB+AMP agrees with the precise experimental data of 5.444 fm, the small deviation of the theoretical result from the data on $\sigma_R$ allows us to scale the GHFB+AMP neutron density so as to reproduce the $\sigma_R$ data.
  In $E_{\rm in}$ = 30--100 MeV, the experimental $\sigma_R$ data can be reproduced by assuming the neutron radius of ${}^{208}{\rm Pb}$ as $R_n$ = $5.722 \pm 0.035$ fm. \item[Conclusion]
  The present result $R_{\rm skin}$ = $0.278 \pm 0.035$ fm is in good agreement with the recent PREX-II result of $r_{\rm skin}$ = $0.283\pm 0.071$ fm.</description>

      <title>Reaction cross section of proton scattering consistent with PREX-II (published in Results in Physics)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.08903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The neutron skin thickness $R_{\rm skin}^{\rm PV}$ of PREX-II is presented in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 126}, 172502 (2021). The reaction cross section $\sigma_R$ is useful to determine the matter radius $R_m$ and $R_{\rm skin}$. For proton scattering, the reaction cross section $\sigma_R$ are available for $E_{\rm in} &gt; 400$ MeV.
  Method and results: We determine $R_n^{\rm exp}=5.727 \pm 0.071$ fm and $R_m^{\rm exp}=5.617 \pm 0.044$ fm from $R_p^{\rm exp}$ = 5.444 fm and $R_{\rm skin}^{\rm PV}$. The $R_p^{\rm GHFB}$ calculated with D1S-GHFB with the angular momentum projection (AMP). agrees with $R_p^{\rm exp}$. The neutron density calculated with GHFB+AMP is scaled so as to $R_n^{\rm scaling}=5.727$ fm. The Love-Franey $t$-matrix model with the scaled densities reproduces the data on $\sigma_R$.
  Aim: Our aim is to find the $\sigma_R$ of proton scattering consistent with $R_{\rm skin}^{\rm PV}$.
  Conclusion: The $\sigma_R$ of proton scattering consistent with $R_{\rm skin}^{\rm PV}$ are $\sigma_R^{\rm exp}$ at $E_{\rm in} = 534.1, 549, 806$ MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we determined $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm exp})=0.278 \pm 0.035$~fm from $\sigma_{\rm R}$ for p+$^{208}$Pb scattering, using the Kyushu (chiral) $g$-matrix folding model with the densities calculated with D1S-GHFB with the angular momentum projection (AMP). The value agrees with that of PREX2. Reaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm R}$ are available for p+$^{48}$Ca scattering, whereas interaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm I}$ are available for $^{48}$Ca + $^{12}$C scattering. As for $^{48}$Ca, the high-resolution $E1$ polarizability experiment ($E1$pE) yields $r_{\rm skin}^{48}(E1{\rm pE}) =0.14 \sim 0.20~{\rm fm}$. We determine $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm exp})$ from the data on $\sigma_{\rm R}$ for p+$^{48}$Ca scattering and from the data on $\sigma_{\rm I}$ for $^{48}$Ca+$^{12}$C scattering. We use the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model with the densities calculated with the D1M-GHFB+AMP densities. The D1M-GHFB+AMP proton and neutron densities are scaled so as to reproduce the data under the condition that the radius $r_{\rm p}$ of the scaled proton density equals the data $r_{\rm p}({\rm exp})$ determined from the electron scattering. We deduce skin values $r_{\rm skin}=r_{\rm n}({\rm exp})-r_{\rm p}({\rm exp})$ from the resulting $r_{\rm n}({\rm exp})$ and the $r_{\rm p}({\rm exp})$ determined from electron scattering. The same procedure is taken for D1S-GHFB+AMP. We regard $r_{\rm skin}^{48}(E1{\rm pE})$ as a reference skin value. Using the reference skin value and taking D1M-GHFB+AMP, we determine $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm exp})=0.158 \pm 0.025$~fm for p+$^{48}$Ca scattering and $0.160 \pm 0.058$~fm for $^{48}$Ca + $^{12}$C scattering. We take the weighted mean and its error for the two skin values. The result is $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm exp})=0.158 \pm (0.023)_{\rm exp} \pm (0.012)_{\rm th}~{\rm fm}$.</description>

Abstract: For $^{4,6,8}$He, Tanihata et al. determined matter radii $r_{m}(\sigma_{\rm I})=1.57(4), 2.48(3), 2.52(3)$~fm from interaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm I}$ for $^{4,6,8}$He scattering on Be, C Al targets at 790~MeV/nucleon. Lu et al. measured the atomic isotope shifts (AIS) for $^{4,6,8}$He and determined proton radii $r_{p}({\rm AIS})$ for $^{4,6,8}$He. As for p+$^{4,6,8}$He scattering, reaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$ are available at 700~MeV with high accuracy. Our aim is to determine matter radii $r_{m}$ and skins $r_{\rm skin}$ for $^{6,8}$He from the $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$ and the $r_{p}({\rm AIS})$. {\bf Method:} Our model is the Love-Franey $t$-matrix folding model, since the model is better than the optical limit of Glauber model. Our results for $^{6,8}$He are $r_{m}({\rm exp})=2.48(3), 2.53(2)$~fm and $r_{\rm skin}=$0.78(3), 0.82(2)~fm. For $^{6,8}$He, our results $r_{m}(\sigma_{\rm R})$ agree with those of Tanihata {\it et al.}. For $^{8}$He, the distance between $^{4}$He and the center of mass of valence four neutrons is 2.367~fm.</description>

Abstract: [Background] Very lately, the CREX group presents a skin value $\Delta R_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm CREX}) =0.121 \pm 0.026\ {\rm (exp)} \pm 0.024\ {\rm (model)}=0.071\sim 0.171$~fm. Meanwhile, the PREX group reported a skin value $\Delta R_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX2}) = 0.283\pm 0.071=0.212 \sim 0.354$~fm. In our previous paper, we determined both the $L$--$\Delta R_{\rm skin}^{48}$ relation and the $L$--$\Delta R_{\rm skin}^{208}$ one, using 206 EoSs, where $L$ is a slope parameter. [Purpose] We determine $L$ from $\Delta R_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm CREX})$ and $\Delta R_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX2}) $, using 207 EoSs. [Results] The $\Delta R_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm CREX})$ yields $L({\rm CREX})=0 \sim 51$~MeV and the $\Delta R_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX2}) $ does $L({\rm PREX2})=76 \sim 165$~MeV. [Conclusion] There is no overlap between $L({\rm CREX})$ and $L({\rm PREX2})$. This is a big problem to be solved.</description>

      <title>Skin values of $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca determined from reaction cross sections (published in Results in Physics)</title>

Abstract: The PREX and the CREX group reported their skin values. Using the Love-Franey (LF) $t$-matrix folding model with the neutron and proton densities scaled to the neutron radius $r_{\rm n}^{208}({\rm PREX2})$ and the proton radius of the electron scattering, we found that the model reproduces $\sigma_R$ for p+ $^{208}$Pb scattering at $E_{\rm lab} = 534.1, 549, 806$MeV. Zenihiro {\it el al. } deduce neutron radii $r_{\rm n}^{48,40}({\rm exp})$ from proton elastic scattering, whereas we determine $r_{\rm m}^{\rm 40}({\rm exp})=3.361 \pm 0.075$fm from measured $\sigma_R$ for $^{4}$He+ $^{40}$Ca scattering. Our first aim is to determine $r_{\rm skin}^{\rm 208}$ from measured $\sigma_R$ of p+$^{208}$Pb scattering at $E_{\rm lab} = 534.1, 549, 806$MeV by using the LF $t$-matrix folding model. Our second aim is to determine $r_{\rm skin}^{\rm 48}$ from the $r_{\rm m}^{\rm 40}({\rm exp})$ and $\Delta \equiv r_{\rm m}^{\rm 48}({\rm exp})-r_{\rm m}^{\rm 40}({\rm exp})$ that is evaluated from the $r_{\rm n}^{48,40}({\rm exp})$ and the $r_{\rm p}^{48,40}({\rm exp})$ calculated with the isotope shift method based on the electron scattering. For the first aim, we use the LF $t$-matrix model with the densities scaled from the D1S-GHFB+AMP neutron density. The D1M-GHFB+AMP is used to estimate a theoretical error. The resulting skin values are $r_{\rm skin}^{\rm 208}= 0.324 \pm 0.047$fm for D1S and $r_{\rm skin}^{\rm 208}({\rm exp})=0.333 \pm 0.047 $fm for D1M. The $\Delta=0.109$fm and $r_{\rm m}^{\rm 40}({\rm exp})=3.361 \pm 0.075$fm yield $r_{\rm m}^{\rm 48}=3.470 \pm 0.075$fm, leading to $r_{\rm skin}^{\rm 48}=0.144 \pm 0.075$fm. We conclude that $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm exp})=0.324 \pm (0.047)_{\rm exp} \pm (0.009)_{\rm th}~{\rm fm}$ for p scattering at $E_{\rm lab} = 534.1, 549, 806$MeV. Our skin values are consistent with the PREX2 and CREX values.</description>

      <title>Determination of matter radius and neutron-skin thickness of $^{60,62,64}$Ni from reaction cross section of proton scattering on $^{60,62,64}$Ni targets (published in Results in Physics)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work, we determined matter radii $r_{\rm m}({\rm exp})$ and neutron-skin thickness $r_{\rm skin}({\rm exp})$ from reaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$ of proton scattering on $^{208}$Pb, $^{58}$Ni, $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{12}$C targets, using the chiral (Kyushu) $g$-matrix folding model with the densities calculated with Gogny-D1S-HFB (D1S-GHFB) with angular momentum projection (AMP). The resultant $r_{\rm skin}({\rm exp})$ agree with the PREX2 and CREX values. As for $^{58}$Ni, our value is consistent with one determined from the differential cross section for $^{58}$Ni+$^{4}$He scattering. As for p+$^{60,62,64}$N scattering, $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$ are available as a function of incident energies $E_{\rm in}$, where $E_{\rm in}=22.8 \sim 65.5$~MeV for $^{60}$Ni, $E_{\rm in}=40,60.8$~MeV for $^{62}$Ni, $E_{\rm in}=40, 60.8$~MeV for $^{64}$Ni. Our aim is to determine matter radii $r_{\rm m}({\rm exp})$ for $^{60,62,64}$Ni from the $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$. Our method is the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model with the densities scaled from D1S-GHFB+AMP densities, Our skin values are $r_{\rm skin}({\rm exp})=0.076 \pm 0.019,~0.106 \pm 0.192,~0.162 \pm 0.176$~fm, and $r_{\rm m}({\rm exp})=3.759 \pm 0.011,~3.811 \pm 0.107,~3.864 \pm 0.101$~fm for $^{60,62,64}$Ni, respectively.</description>

Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions has recently emerged as a powerful ``imaging-by-smashing'' tool to reveal the global shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I layout a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter from hard dense loop perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the hard dense loop perturbation theory approach for studying the thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter. The free energy of quarks and gluons have been calculated for one-loop quark and gluon self-energies, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse components of pressure, magnetization, second-order quark number susceptibility, and speed of sound have been computed, and their behavior with chemical potential and magnetic field has been analyzed. Our numerical results show that the longitudinal pressure increases with chemical potential and magnetic field, while for the transverse component, it is diminished. We also analyze the longitudinal component of the speed of sound at high chemical potentials, which approaches the speed of light in the asymptotic limit. The obtained results may be helpful in studying magnetized quark matter in the core of neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Study of light $\phi$-mesic nuclei with HAL QCD $\phi N$ interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possible existence of light $\phi$-mesic nuclei using HAL QCD $\phi N$ interactions for the $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^4S_{3/2}$ channels. Particularly, using the Faddeev formalism in configuration space, the $\phi NN$ system, and $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He nuclei within the framework of the three-body cluster model, are investigated. The $\phi\alpha$ effective potential, obtained through a folding procedure, involves the HAL QCD $\phi N$ interaction in the $^4S_{3/2}$ channel which does not lead to a bound state of the $\phi N$ pair while the $\phi N$ $^2S_{1/2}$ channel yields the bound state as the $^3_\phi$H nucleus. The $^4S_{3/2}$ potential ensures that the folding procedure is appropriate because there are no open channels like $\phi+N$ and $\phi +2N $ near or below the $\phi+ 4N$ threshold, and it utilizes different matter distributions of $^4$He proposed in the literature. The folding potential is approximated by the Woods-Saxon formula. The mirror systems $\phi$+$\alpha$+$\alpha$ and $\phi$+$\phi$+$\alpha$ have energy ranges from 1-11 MeV and 3-10~MeV, respectively. The predicted binding energies represent the minimal values for the hypothetical $\phi$ mesic nuclei $^{5}_{\phi}$He, $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He. The phenomenological $\alpha\alpha$ and $\phi\phi$ potentials are adopted from the literature.</description>

      <title>Separating non-collective effects in d-Au collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the multiplicity and yields of charged hadrons and particle ratios in d-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV using the PYTHIA8/Angantyr. The model reproduces the multiplicity ($N_{ch}$) and pseudo-rapidity distribution reasonably well in minimum-biased d-Au collisions without assuming the formation of a thermalized medium. The invariant yield from Angantyr underpredicts the data in central collisions. We discussed the similarity between the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and data/MC from Angantyr and the possibility of using it as an alternative to check in-medium effects. The data/MC suggests that the central d-Au collisions exhibit signals like baryon enhancement, but no high $p_T$ suppression was found. The d-Au collisions have a much smaller invariant yield than the thermal model calculation for similar $N_{part}$. Based on the available data and simulation results, we argue that a medium may form in the central d-Au collision, but it differs from the perfect QGP formed in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC.</description>

      <title>Identifying $\alpha$-cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne via ultracentral Ne+Ne Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial-state geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a novel probe to nuclear cluster structure. For $^{20}$Ne, a novel approach is proposed to distinguish between the cluster configurations (5$\alpha$ versus $\alpha + ^{16}$O) in order to gain insight into nuclear structure transitions governed by many-body quantum correlations. Through the microscopic Brink model, we establish the normalized symmetric cumulant NSC (3, 2) and the Pearson coefficient $\rho (\varepsilon_{3}^{2},\ \delta d_{\perp})$ as quantitative discriminators to reveal enhanced cluster degrees of freedom in the ground state of $^{20}$Ne. The upcoming ultracentral Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC can experimentally identify these two competing configurations via these flow correlation observables, opening a new paradigm for probing clustering in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Charge radii and their deformation correlation for even-$Z$ nuclei in deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systematics are investigated for the charge radii of the even-$Z$ nuclei with $8 \leqslant Z \leqslant 120$ calculated by the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with the functional PC-PK1, and their deformation correlation is explored. The available data of the charge radius are reproduced with a root-mean-square deviation $\sigma=0.033$ fm. In particular, for the nuclei between the closed shells, the descriptions of the charge radii are remarkably improved by including the deformation. Taking molybdenum isotopes as examples, both the evolutions of the charge radius and deformation are well reproduced. It is found that while the charge radius typically increases with the deformation, there also exist different cases. For example, in $^{346}$Sg, the charge radius of the deformed ground state is smaller than the one of the spherical state, and the largest binding energy does not necessarily correspond to the smallest charge radius. The increase or decrease of the charge radii with deformation is related to specific shell structures, particularly the key single-particle levels near the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the global multiplicity and spectral shape fluctuations in radial flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radial flow is a key collective phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions, manifests through event-by-event fluctuations in transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential radial flow, $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$, initially conceived to capture local spectral shape fluctuations, is influenced by global multiplicity fluctuations. Using the HIJING model, we explore how different definitions of event activity for centrality and spectral normalization schemes affect $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$. We find these methodological variations induce a constant offset in $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ without altering its shape, indicating that the dynamic $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential information on radial flow remains robust, but its absolute magnitude is meaningful only up to a baseline offset dictated by global multiplicity fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: The PREX group reported a new skin value, $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX2}) = 0.283 \pm 0.071{\rm fm}$. Using the chiral (Kyushu) $g$-matrix folding model with the proton and neutron densities determined with D1S+GHFB+AMP, we determined neutron skin thickness $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm exp})$ from reaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$ of p+$^{208}$Pb scattering. The method also yielded $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm exp})$ from $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$ of $^{4}$He+$^{208}$Pb scattering. We accumulated the 206 EoSs and determined a sloop parameter from the 206 EoSs. The value yields $r_{\rm skin}^{208}=0.102 \sim 0.354~{\rm fm}$. As the first aim, we first determine $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm exp})$ from $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$ of $^{3}$He scattering on $^{208}$Pb target and take the weighted mean and its error for $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX2})$, three skin values of p+$^{208}$Pb, $^{3, 4}$He+$^{208}$Pb scattering and the $r_{\rm skin}^{208}$ based on the 206 EoSs. As the second aim, we determine matter radii $r_{m}({\rm exp})$ of $^{58,60,64}$Ni from $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm exp})$ of $^{3,4}$He scattering on $^{58,60,64}$Ni targets. Our result is $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm exp}) =0.512 \pm 0.268~{\rm fm}$ for $^{3}$He+$^{208}$Pb scattering. Our conclusion is $r_{\rm skin}^{208} =0.285 \pm 0.030~{\rm fm}$. It is determined from the 5 skin values mentioned above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the nonabelian dipole problem in the context of a simple semiclassical approach which incorporates some essential features of the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, in particular, the fact that both the running coupling and the gluon propagator remain finite at infrared scales and that the latter shows positivity violations which reflects the presence of massless modes. We obtain a simple flux tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, that we compare to the results of lattice simulations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a system of bosons in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. In the limit of strong attractive interactions, the bosons make a droplet insensitive to external confinement. For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Corrections to Quark TMDPDFs in the Background-Field Method: Gauge Invariance, Equations of Motion, and Multiple Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed.</description>
