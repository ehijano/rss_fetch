      <title>Pseudo-isotopies of 3-manifolds with infinite fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $Y$ is a compact, connected, oriented 3-manifold possibly with boundary, such that $\pi_1(Y)$ is infinite. Let $\operatorname{Diff}_\partial(I\times Y)$ denote the group of self-diffeomorphisms of $I\times Y$ that are equal to the identity near the boundary. Let $\operatorname{Diff}_{PI}(I\times Y)$ denote the subgroup of $\operatorname{Diff}_\partial(I\times Y)$ consisting of elements pseudo-isotopic to the identity. Define $\operatorname{Homeo}_\partial(I\times Y)$, $\operatorname{Homeo}_{PI}(I\times Y)$ similarly for homeomorphisms. We show that the canonical map $\pi_0\operatorname{Diff}_{PI}(I\times Y) \to \pi_0\operatorname{Homeo}_{PI}(I\times Y)$ is of infinite rank. As a consequence, $\pi_0\operatorname{Diff}_{PI}(I\times Y)$, $\pi_0\operatorname{Diff}_{\partial}(I\times Y)$, $\pi_0\operatorname{Homeo}_{PI}(I\times Y)$, $\pi_0\operatorname{Homeo}_{\partial}(I\times Y)$ are all abelian groups of infinite rank. We also prove that $\pi_0\,C(Y)$ contains an abelian subgroup of infinite rank, and $\pi_0\,C(I\times Y)$ admits a surjection to an abelian group of infinite rank, where $C(X)$ denotes the concordance automorphism group $\operatorname{Diff}(I\times X, \{0\}\times X\cup I\times \partial X)$ or $\operatorname{Homeo}(I\times X, \{0\}\times X\cup I\times \partial X)$. These results are proved by studying the actions of barbell diffeomorphisms on the spaces of embedded arcs and configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of fine curve and fine arc complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine curve complex of a surface is a simplicial complex whose vertices are essential simple closed curves and whose $k$-simplices are collections of $k+1$ disjoint curves. We prove that the fine curve complex is homotopy equivalent to the curve complex. We also prove that the fine arc complex is contractible.</description>

      <title>A polynomial upper bound on Reidemeister moves for each link type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each link type $K$ in the 3-sphere, we show that there is a polynomial $p_K$ such that any two diagrams of $K$ with $c_1$ and $c_2$ crossings differ by at most $p_K(c_1) + p_K(c_2)$ Reidemeister moves. As a consequence, the problem of recognising whether a given link diagram represents $K$ is in the complexity class NP and hence can be completed deterministically in exponential time. We calculate this polynomial $p_K$ explicitly for various classes of links.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many Lefschetz pencils on ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any ruled surface $X$ with $\chi(X) &lt; 0$ admits infinitely many inequivalent Lefschetz pencils of fixed genus and number of base points. Our proof proceeds by building infinitely many inequivalent Lefschetz fibrations on a blow-up $X \# 4 \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ of $X$ with constant fiber class, via a mechanism known as partial conjugation. Furthermore, there exists a symplectic form on $X$ compatible with all such pencils, and similarly for the fibrations in $X\#4\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. This provides the first example of this phenomenon and makes progress on Problem 4.98 of the K3 list of problems in low-dimensional topology in the case of ruled surfaces.</description>

      <title>Impossible by Degrees: Cohomology &amp; Bistable Visual Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Penrose triangle, staircase, and related ``impossible objects'' have long been understood as related to first cohomology $H^1$: the obstruction to extending locally consistent interpretations around a loop. This paper develops a cohomological hierarchy for a class of visual paradoxes. Restricting to systems built from \emph{bistable} elements -- components admitting exactly two local states, such as the Necker cube's forward/backward orientations, a gear's clockwise/counterclockwise spin, or a rhombic tiling corner's convex/concave interpretation -- allows the use of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients throughout, reducing obstruction theory to parity arithmetic. This reveals a hierarchy of paradox classes from $H^0$ through $H^2$, refined at each degree by the relative/absolute distinction, ranging from ambiguity through impossibility to inaccessibility. A discrete Stokes theorem emerges as the central tool: at each degree, the connecting homomorphism of relative cohomology promotes boundary data to interior obstruction, providing the uniform mechanism by which paradoxes ascend the hierarchy.
  Three paradigmatic systems -- Necker cube fields, gear meshes, and rhombic tilings -- are studied in detail. Throughout, we pair cohomology with imagery and animation. To illuminate the underlying structure, we introduce the \emph{Method of Monodromic Apertures}, an animation technique that reveals monodromy through a configuration space of local sections.</description>

      <title>The Carath\'eodory metric on Teichm\"uller space of genus two surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Tei_{g,n}$ be the Teichm\"uller space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures. It is conjectured that the Teichm\"uller and Carath\'{e}odory metrics agree on a Teichm\"{u}ller disk if and only if all the zeros of the corresponding holomorphic quadratic differential are of even order. The conjecture was proved by Gekhtman and Markovic for $\Tei_{0,5}\cong \Tei_{1,2}$. We confirm the conjecture for $\Tei_{2,0}\cong\Tei_{0,6}$.</description>

      <title>A new construction of subgroups of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.05976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct new subgroups of the mapping class groups of an uncountable collection of infinite-type surfaces, including, but not limited to, free groups, Baumslag-Solitar groups, mapping class groups of other surfaces, and a large collection of wreath products. For each such subgroup $H$ and surface $S$, we show that there are countably many non-conjugate embeddings of $H$ into $\textrm{Map}(S)$; in certain cases, there are uncountably many such embeddings. The images of each of these embeddings cannot lie in the isometry group of $S$ for any hyperbolic metric and are not contained in the closure of the compactly supported subgroup of $\textrm{Map}(S)$. In this sense, our construction is new and does not rely on previously known techniques for constructing subgroups of mapping class groups. Notably, our embeddings of $\textrm{Map}(S')$ into $\textrm{Map}(S)$ are not induced by embeddings of $S'$ into $S$. Our main tool for all of these constructions is the utilization of special homeomorphisms of $S$ called shift maps, and more generally, multipush maps.</description>

Abstract: We review the main achievements regarding the interactions between gem theory (which makes use of edge-colored graphs to represent PL-manifolds of arbitrary dimension) and both the classical representation of PL 4-manifolds via Kirby diagrams and the more recent one via trisections. Original results also appear (in particular, about gems representing closed 4-manifolds which need 3-handles in their handle decomposition, as well as about trisection diagrams), together with open problems and further possible applications to the study of compact PL 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>On 3-manifolds admitting co-orientable taut foliations, but none with vanishing Euler class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we construct infinitely many (small Seifert fibred, hyperbolic and toroidal) rational homology $3$-spheres that admit co-orientable taut foliations, but none with vanishing Euler class. In the context of the $L$-space conjecture, these examples provide rational homology $3$-spheres that admit co-orientable taut foliations (and hence are not $L$-spaces) and have left-orderable fundamental groups, yet none of the left orders arise directly from the universal circle actions associated to co-orientable taut foliations.
  The hyperbolic and non-Seifert toroidal examples are obtained from Dehn surgeries on knots in the $3$-sphere and use Heegaard Floer homology to obstruct the existence of a co-orientable foliation with vanishing Euler class. For the Seifert fibred case, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the Euler class of the normal bundle of the Seifert fibration to vanish. Moreover, when the base orbifold is hyperbolic, we also provide a second proof of this condition from the viewpoint of discrete faithful representations of Fuchsian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a rational homology 3-sphere $M$ bounds a rational homology 4-ball $W$, then the kernel of the inclusion-induced homomorphism $H_1(M;\mathbb{Z})\to H_1(W;\mathbb{Z})$ is a Lagrangian for the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-valued torsion linking form $\lambda_2$ on $H_1(M;\mathbb{Z})$. In this short paper, we prove that the Freedman-Krushkal triple torsion linking form $\lambda_3$ (arXiv:2506.11941v3) vanishes on this Lagrangian under the assumption that $H_2(W;\mathbb{Z})=0$. We then pose several questions about topological rational homology cobordism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds with totally geodesic boundary, such that the closed 3-pseudomanifolds obtained by coning off the boundary components are negatively curved and contain locally convex subspaces whose fundamental groups have property (T). In particular, the fundamental groups of these 3-pseudomanifolds are word hyperbolic but not cubulable. We deduce that in any relative cubulation of one of these hyperbolic 3-manifold groups some hyperplane stabilizer has infinite intersection with the fundamental group of some boundary component.</description>

      <title>Blanchfield pairings and twisted Blanchfield pairings of torus knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give explicit matrix presentations of the Blanchfield pairing and certain twisted Blanchfield pairings of the $(m,n)$-torus knot $T(m,n)$. Our method uses a taut identity realizing a genus-two Heegaard splitting of the manifold $X_{T(m,n)}$ obtained from $S^3$ by $0$-surgery along $T(m,n)$. The taut identity allows us to construct a chain complex of $X_{T(m,n)}$ with few generators. As a result, we obtain explicit matrix presentations of the Blanchfield pairing of $T(m,n)$. Moreover, for each Casson-Gordon type metabelian representation and for suitable roots of unity $\xi$ depending on the representation, we describe the $(t-\xi)$-primary part of the associated twisted Alexander module and give an explicit description of the restriction of the twisted Blanchfield pairing to this primary summand.</description>

      <title>Dense and empty BNSR-invariants of the McCool groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An automorphism of the free group $F_n$ is called pure symmetric if it sends each generator to a conjugate of itself. The group $\mathrm{PSA}_n$ of all pure symmetric automorphisms and its quotient $\mathrm{PSO}_n$ by the group of inner automorphisms are called the McCool groups. In this paper we prove that every BNSR-invariant $\Sigma^m$ of a McCool group is either dense or empty in the character sphere, and we characterize precisely when each situation occurs. Our techniques involve understanding higher generation properties of abelian subgroups of McCool groups, coming from the McCullough-Miller space. We also investigate further properties of the second invariant $\Sigma^2$ for McCool groups using a general criterion due to Meinert for a character to lie in $\Sigma^2$.</description>

      <title>The tight length spectrum of large-genus random hyperbolic surfaces with many cusps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the work of Mirzakhani and Petri on random hyperbolic surfaces of large genus, length statistics of closed geodesics have been studied extensively. We focus on the case of random hyperbolic surfaces with cusps, the number of which grows with the genus. We prove that if the number of cusps grows fast enough and we restrict attention to special geodesics that are tight, we recover upon proper normalization the same Poisson point process in the large genus limit for the length statistics. The proof relies on a recursion formula for tight Weil-Petersson volumes obtained recently by Budd and Zonneveld and on a generalization of Mirzakhani's integration formula to the tight setting.</description>
