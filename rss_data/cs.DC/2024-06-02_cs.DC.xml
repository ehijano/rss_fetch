      <title>Decentralized AI: Permissionless LLM Inference on POKT Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: POKT Network's decentralized Remote Procedure Call (RPC) infrastructure, surpassing 740 billion requests since launching on MainNet in 2020, is well-positioned to extend into providing AI inference services with minimal design or implementation modifications. This litepaper illustrates how the network's open-source and permissionless design aligns incentives among model researchers, hardware operators, API providers and users whom we term model Sources, Suppliers, Gateways and Applications respectively. Through its Relay Mining algorithm, POKT creates a transparent marketplace where costs and earnings directly reflect cryptographically verified usage. This decentralized framework offers large model AI researchers a new avenue to disseminate their work and generate revenue without the complexities of maintaining infrastructure or building end-user products. Supply scales naturally with demand, as evidenced in recent years and the protocol's free market dynamics. POKT Gateways facilitate network growth, evolution, adoption, and quality by acting as application-facing load balancers, providing value-added features without managing LLM nodes directly. This vertically decoupled network, battle tested over several years, is set up to accelerate the adoption, operation, innovation and financialization of open-source models. It is the first mature permissionless network whose quality of service competes with centralized entities set up to provide application grade inference.</description>

      <title>Shoal++: High Throughput DAG BFT Can Be Fast!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's practical partially synchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols trade off low latency and high throughput. On the one end, traditional BFT protocols such as PBFT and its derivatives optimize for latency. They require, in fault-free executions, only 3 message exchanges to commit, the optimum for BFT consensus. However, this class of protocols typically relies on a single leader, hampering throughput scalability. On the other end, a new class of so-called DAG-BFT protocols demonstrates how to achieve highly scalable throughput by separating data dissemination from consensus, and using every replica as proposer. Unfortunately, existing DAG-BFT protocols pay a steep latency premium, requiring on average 10.5 message exchanges to commit a transactions.
  This work aims to soften this tension and proposes Shoal++, a novel DAG-based BFT consensus system that offers the throughput of DAGs while reducing commit latency to an average of 4.5 message exchanges. Our empirical findings are encouraging, showing that Shoal++ achieves throughput comparable to state-of-the-art DAG BFT solutions while reducing latency by up to 60%.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Resource Management and Workloads Scheduling in Cloud-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing across Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the limited resource capacity of edge servers and the high purchase costs of edge resources, service providers are facing the new challenge of how to take full advantage of the constrained edge resources for Internet of Things (IoT) service hosting and task scheduling to maximize system performance. In this paper, we study the joint optimization problem on service placement, resource provisioning, and workloads scheduling under resource and budget constraints, which is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem. Given that the frequent service placement and resource provisioning will significantly increase system configuration costs and instability, we propose a two-timescale framework for resource management and workloads scheduling, named RMWS. RMWS consists of a Gibbs sampling algorithm and an alternating minimization algorithm to determine the service placement and resource provisioning on large timescales. And a sub-gradient descent method has been designed to solve the workload scheduling challenge on small timescales.We conduct comprehensive experiments under different parameter settings. The RMWS consistently ensures a minimum 10% performance enhancement compared to other algorithms, showcasing its superiority. Theoretical proofs are also provided accordingly.</description>

      <title>Distributed Simulation for Digital Twins of Large-Scale Real-World DiffServ-Based Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twin technology facilitates the monitoring and online analysis of large-scale communication networks. Faster predictions of network performance thus become imperative, especially for analysing Quality of Service (QoS) parameters in large-scale city networks. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a standard network analysis technology, and can be further optimised with parallel and distributed execution for speedup, referred to as Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES). However, modelling detailed QoS mechanisms such as DiffServ requires complex event handling for each network router, which can involve excessive simulation events. In addition, current PDES for network analysis mostly adopts conservative scheduling, which suffers from excessive global synchronisation to avoid causality problems. The performance analysis of optimistic PDES for real-world large-scale network topology and complex QoS mechanisms is still inadequate. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a simulation toolkit, Quaint, which leverages an optimistic PDES engine ROSS, for detailed modelling of DiffServ-based networks. A novel event-handling model for each network router is also proposed to significantly reduce the number of events in complex QoS modelling. Quaint has been evaluated using a real-world metropolitan-scale network topology with 5,000 routers/switches. Results show that compared to the conventional simulator OMNeT++/INET, even the sequential mode of Quaint can achieve a speedup of 53 times, and the distributed mode has a speedup of 232 times. Scalability characterisation is conducted to portray the efficiency of distributed execution, and the results indicate the future direction for workload-aware model partitioning.</description>

      <title>FunLess: Functions-as-a-Service for Private Edge Cloud Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FunLess, a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform tailored for the private edge cloud system. FunLess responds to recent trends that advocate for extending the coverage of serverless computing to private edge cloud systems and enhancing latency, security, and privacy while improving resource usage. Unlike existing solutions that rely on containers for function invocation, FunLess leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) as its runtime environment. Wasm's lightweight, sandboxed runtime is crucial to have functions run on constrained devices at the edge. Moreover, the advantages of using Wasm in FunLess include a consistent development and deployment environment for users and function portability (write once, run everywhere)
  We validate FunLess under different deployment scenarios, characterised by the presence/absence of constrained-resource devices (Raspberry Pi 3B+) and the (in)accessibility of container orchestration technologies - Kubernetes. We compare FunLess with three production-ready, widely adopted open-source FaaS platforms - OpenFaaS, Fission, and Knative. Our benchmarks confirm that FunLess is a proper solution for FaaS private edge cloud systems since it achieves performance comparable to the considered FaaS alternatives while it is the only fully-deployable alternative on constrained-resource devices, thanks to its small memory footprint.</description>

      <title>On reduction and parameter recovering of Petri's cycloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycloids are particular Petri nets for modelling processes of actions and events, belonging to the fundaments of Petri's general systems theory. Defined by four parameters they provide an algebraic formalism to describe strongly synchronized sequential processes. To further investigate their structure, reduction systems of cycloids are defined in the style of rewriting systems and properties of reduced cycloids are proved. In particular the recovering of cycloid parameters from their Petri net structure is derived.</description>

      <title>Selective Knowledge Sharing for Personalized Federated Learning Under Capacity Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) stands to gain significant advantages from collaboratively training capacity-heterogeneous models, enabling the utilization of private data and computing power from low-capacity devices. However, the focus on personalizing capacity-heterogeneous models based on client-specific data has been limited, resulting in suboptimal local model utility, particularly for low-capacity clients. The heterogeneity in both data and device capacity poses two key challenges for model personalization: 1) accurately retaining necessary knowledge embedded within reduced submodels for each client, and 2) effectively sharing knowledge through aggregating size-varying parameters. To this end, we introduce Pa3dFL, a novel framework designed to enhance local model performance by decoupling and selectively sharing knowledge among capacity-heterogeneous models. First, we decompose each layer of the model into general and personal parameters. Then, we maintain uniform sizes for the general parameters across clients and aggregate them through direct averaging. Subsequently, we employ a hyper-network to generate size-varying personal parameters for clients using learnable embeddings. Finally, we facilitate the implicit aggregation of personal parameters by aggregating client embeddings through a self-attention module. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of Pa3dFL. Our findings indicate that Pa3dFL consistently outperforms baseline methods across various heterogeneity settings. Moreover, Pa3dFL demonstrates competitive communication and computation efficiency compared to baseline approaches, highlighting its practicality and adaptability in adverse system conditions.</description>

      <title>GANcrop: A Contrastive Defense Against Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With heightened awareness of data privacy protection, Federated Learning (FL) has attracted widespread attention as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning method. However, the distributed nature of federated learning also provides opportunities for backdoor attacks, where attackers can guide the model to produce incorrect predictions without affecting the global model training process.
  This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in federated learning, named GANcrop. This approach leverages contrastive learning to deeply explore the disparities between malicious and benign models for attack identification, followed by the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to recover backdoor triggers and implement targeted mitigation strategies. Experimental findings demonstrate that GANcrop effectively safeguards against backdoor attacks, particularly in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining satisfactory model accuracy, showcasing its remarkable defensive efficacy and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Share Your Secrets for Privacy! Confidential Forecasting with Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series forecasting in industrial applications, such as predictive maintenance and machine control. Critical challenges to address in manufacturing include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, to increase industry adaptability, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address those challenges and propose 'Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL' (STV), a novel framework that exhibits the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically partitioned data; ii) serverless forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for direct parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal hyperparameter tuning complexity. We conduct evaluations on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Our results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. They also show that our direct optimization can outperform centralized methods, which include state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also conduct a scalability analysis by examining the communication costs of direct and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two.

      <title>Federated Learning with Blockchain-Enhanced Machine Unlearning: A Trustworthy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing need to comply with privacy regulations and respond to user data deletion requests, integrating machine unlearning into IoT-based federated learning has become imperative. Traditional unlearning methods, however, often lack verifiable mechanisms, leading to challenges in establishing trust. This paper delves into the innovative integration of blockchain technology with federated learning to surmount these obstacles. Blockchain fortifies the unlearning process through its inherent qualities of immutability, transparency, and robust security. It facilitates verifiable certification, harmonizes security with privacy, and sustains system efficiency. We introduce a framework that melds blockchain with federated learning, thereby ensuring an immutable record of unlearning requests and actions. This strategy not only bolsters the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model but also adeptly addresses efficiency and security challenges typical in IoT environments. Our key contributions encompass a certification mechanism for the unlearning process, the enhancement of data security and privacy, and the optimization of data management to ensure system responsiveness in IoT scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pursuing Overall Welfare in Federated Learning through Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional federated learning, a single global model cannot perform equally well for all clients. Therefore, the need to achieve the client-level fairness in federated system has been emphasized, which can be realized by modifying the static aggregation scheme for updating the global model to an adaptive one, in response to the local signals of the participating clients. Our work reveals that existing fairness-aware aggregation strategies can be unified into an online convex optimization framework, in other words, a central server's sequential decision making process. To enhance the decision making capability, we propose simple and intuitive improvements for suboptimal designs within existing methods, presenting AAggFF. Considering practical requirements, we further subdivide our method tailored for the cross-device and the cross-silo settings, respectively. Theoretical analyses guarantee sublinear regret upper bounds for both settings: $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log{K}})$ for the cross-device setting, and $\mathcal{O}(K \log{T})$ for the cross-silo setting, with $K$ clients and $T$ federation rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the federated system equipped with AAggFF achieves better degree of client-level fairness than existing methods in both practical settings.

      <title>Waveform Design for Over-the-Air Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the increasing number of devices anticipated in next-generation networks, a shift toward over-the-air (OTA) computing has been proposed. Leveraging the superposition of multiple access channels, OTA computing enables efficient resource management by supporting simultaneous uncoded transmission in the time and the frequency domain. Thus, to advance the integration of OTA computing, our study presents a theoretical analysis addressing practical issues encountered in current digital communication transceivers, such as time sampling error and intersymbol interference (ISI). To this end, we examine the theoretical mean squared error (MSE) for OTA transmission under time sampling error and ISI, while also exploring methods for minimizing the MSE in the OTA transmission. Utilizing alternating optimization, we also derive optimal power policies for both the devices and the base station. Additionally, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based approach to design waveforms enhancing OTA transmission performance under time sampling error and ISI. To ensure fair comparison with existing waveforms like the raised cosine (RC) and the better-than-raised-cosine (BRTC), we incorporate a custom loss function integrating energy and bandwidth constraints, along with practical design considerations such as waveform symmetry. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate performance gains of the designed pulse over RC and BTRC waveforms. To facilitate testing of our results without necessitating the DNN structure recreation, we provide curve fitting parameters for select DNN-based waveforms as well.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Distributed Deep Learning via Federated Dynamic Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the ever-growing volume and decentralized nature of data, coupled with the escalating size of modern models, distributed deep learning (DDL) has been entrenched as the preferred paradigm for training. However, frequent synchronization of DL models, encompassing millions to many billions of parameters, creates a communication bottleneck, severely hindering scalability. Worse yet, DDL algorithms typically waste valuable bandwidth, and make themselves less practical in bandwidth-constrained federated settings, by relying on overly simplistic, periodic, and rigid synchronization schedules. To address these shortcomings, we propose Federated Dynamic Averaging (FDA), a communication-efficient DDL strategy that dynamically triggers synchronization based on the value of the model variance. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of learning tasks we demonstrate that FDA reduces communication cost by orders of magnitude, compared to both traditional and cutting-edge communication-efficient algorithms. Remarkably, FDA achieves this without sacrificing convergence speed - in stark contrast to the trade-offs encountered in the field. Additionally, we show that FDA maintains robust performance across diverse data heterogeneity settings.</description>

      <title>3-center and 4-center 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals on modern accelerated processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson (MD) algorithm for 3-center and 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian atomic orbitals (AOs) with low and high angular momenta $l$ and varying degrees of contraction for graphical processing units (GPUs). This work builds upon our recent implementation of a matrix form of the MD algorithm that is efficient for GPU evaluation of 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian AOs of high angular momenta ($l\geq 4$) [$\mathit{J. Phys. Chem. A}\ \mathbf{127}$, 10889 (2023)]. The use of unconventional data layouts and three variants of the MD algorithm allow to evaluate integrals in double precision with sustained performance between 25% and 70% of the theoretical hardware peak. Performance assessment includes integrals over AOs with $l\leq 6$ (higher $l$ is supported). Preliminary implementation of the Hartree-Fock exchange operator is presented and assessed for computations with up to quadruple-zeta basis and more than 20,000 AOs. The corresponding C++ code is a part of the experimental open-source $\mathtt{LibintX}$ library available at $\mathbf{github.com:ValeevGroup/LibintX}$.</description>
