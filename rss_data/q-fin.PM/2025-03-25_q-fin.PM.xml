      <title>Bayesian Optimization for CVaR-based portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal portfolio allocation is often formulated as a constrained risk problem, where one aims to minimize a risk measure subject to some performance constraints. This paper presents new Bayesian Optimization algorithms for such constrained minimization problems, seeking to minimize the conditional value-at-risk (a computationally intensive risk measure) under a minimum expected return constraint. The proposed algorithms utilize a new acquisition function, which drives sampling towards the optimal region. Additionally, a new two-stage procedure is developed, which significantly reduces the number of evaluations of the expensive-to-evaluate objective function. The proposed algorithm's competitive performance is demonstrated through practical examples.</description>

      <title>Asset pre-selection for a cardinality constrained index tracking portfolio with optional enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An index tracker is a passive investment reproducing the return and risk of a market index, an enhanced index tracker offers a return greater than the index. We consider the selection of a portfolio of given cardinality to track an index, both without and with enhancement. We divide the problem into two steps - (1) pre-selection of assets; (2) estimation of weights on the assets chosen. The eight pre-selection procedures considered use: forward selection (FS) or backward elimination (BE); implemented using ordinary least squares (OLS) or least absolute deviation (LAD) regression; with a regression constant (c) or without (n). The two-step approach avoids the NP-hard problem arising when asset selection and asset weight computation are combined, leading to the selection of a cardinality constrained index tracking portfolio by computer intensive heuristic procedures with many examples in the literature solving for portfolios of 10 or fewer assets. Avoiding these restrictions, we show that out-of-sample tracking errors are roughly proportional to 1/sqrt(cardinality).
  We find OLS more effective than LAD; BE marginally more effective than FS; (n) marginally more effective than (c). For index tracking, both without and with enhancement, we use BE-OLS(n) in sensitivity analyses on the periods used for selection and evaluation. For a S&amp;P 500 index tracker, we find that out-of-sample tracking error, transaction volume and return-risk ratios all improve as cardinality increases. By contrast for enhanced returns, cardinalities of the order 10 to 20 are most effective. The S&amp;P 500 data used from 3/1/2005 to 29/12/2023 is available to researchers.</description>

      <title>Informer in Algorithmic Investment Strategies on High Frequency Bitcoin Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article investigates the usage of Informer architecture for building automated trading strategies for high frequency Bitcoin data. Three strategies using Informer model with different loss functions: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Generalized Mean Absolute Directional Loss (GMADL) and Quantile loss, are proposed and evaluated against the Buy and Hold benchmark and two benchmark strategies based on technical indicators. The evaluation is conducted using data of various frequencies: 5 minute, 15 minute, and 30 minute intervals, over the 6 different periods. Although the Informer-based model with Quantile loss did not outperform the benchmark, two other models achieved better results. The performance of the model using RMSE loss worsens when used with higher frequency data while the model that uses novel GMADL loss function is benefiting from higher frequency data and when trained on 5 minute interval it beat all the other strategies on most of the testing periods. The primary contribution of this study is the application and assessment of the RMSE, GMADL, and Quantile loss functions with the Informer model to forecast future returns, subsequently using these forecasts to develop automated trading strategies. The research provides evidence that employing an Informer model trained with the GMADL loss function can result in superior trading outcomes compared to the buy-and-hold approach.</description>

      <title>Generating realistic metaorders from public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel algorithm for generating realistic metaorders from public trade data, addressing a longstanding challenge in price impact research that has traditionally relied on proprietary datasets. Our method effectively recovers all established stylized facts of metaorders impact, such as the Square Root Law, the concave profile during metaorder execution, and the post-execution decay. This algorithm not only overcomes the dependence on proprietary data, a major barrier to research reproducibility, but also enables the creation of larger and more robust datasets that may increase the quality of empirical studies. Our findings strongly suggest that average realized short-term price impact is not due to information revelation (as in the Kyle framework) but has a mechanical origin which could explain the universality of the Square Root Law.</description>

      <title>Smart leverage? Rethinking the role of Leveraged Exchange Traded Funds in constructing portfolios to beat a benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraged Exchange Traded Funds (LETFs), while extremely controversial in the literature, remain stubbornly popular with both institutional and retail investors in practice. While the criticisms of LETFs are certainly valid, we argue that their potential has been underestimated in the literature due to the use of very simple investment strategies involving LETFs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the potential of including a broad stock market index LETF in long-term, dynamically-optimal investment strategies designed to maximize the outperformance over standard investment benchmarks in the sense of the information ratio (IR). Our results exploit the observation that positions in a LETF deliver call-like payoffs, so that the addition of a LETF to a portfolio can be a convenient way to add inexpensive leverage while providing downside protection. Under stylized assumptions, we present and analyze closed-form IR-optimal investment strategies using either a LETF or standard/vanilla ETF (VETF) on the same equity index, which provides the necessary intuition for the potential and benefits of LETFs. In more realistic settings, we use a neural network-based approach to determine the IR-optimal strategies, trained on bootstrapped historical data. We find that IR-optimal strategies with a broad stock market LETF are not only more likely to outperform the benchmark than IR-optimal strategies derived using the corresponding VETF, but are able to achieve partial stochastic dominance over the benchmark and VETF-based strategies in terms of terminal wealth.</description>
