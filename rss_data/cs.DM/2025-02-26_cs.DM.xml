      <title>An unconditional lower bound for the active-set method on the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a polynomial-time pivot rule for the simplex method is a fundamental open question in optimization. While many super-polynomial lower bounds exist for individual or very restricted classes of pivot rules, there currently is little hope for an unconditional lower bound that addresses all pivot rules. We approach this question by considering the active-set method as a natural generalization of the simplex method to non-linear objectives. This generalization allows us to prove the first unconditional lower bound for all pivot rules. More precisely, we construct a multivariate polynomial of degree linear in the number of dimensions such that the active-set method started in the origin visits all vertices of the hypercube. We hope that our framework serves as a starting point for a new angle of approach to understanding the complexity of the simplex method.</description>

      <title>Restricted CSPs and F-free Digraph Algorithmics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, much attention has been placed on the complexity of graph homomorphism problems when the input is restricted to ${\mathbb P}_k$-free and ${\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free graphs. We consider the directed version of this research line, by addressing the questions, is it true that digraph homomorphism problems CSP$({\mathbb H})$ have a P versus NP-complete dichotomy when the input is restricted to $\vec{\mathbb P}_k$-free (resp.\ $\vec{\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free) digraphs? Our main contribution in this direction shows that if CSP$({\mathbb H})$ is NP-complete, then there is a positive integer $N$ such that CSP$({\mathbb H})$ remains NP-hard even for $\vec{\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs. Moreover, it remains NP-hard for acyclic $\vec{\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs, and becomes polynomial-time solvable for $\vec{\mathbb P}_{N-1}$-subgraph-free acyclic digraphs. We then verify the questions above for digraphs on three vertices and a family of smooth tournaments. We prove these results by establishing a connection between $\mathbb F$-(subgraph)-free algorithmics and constraint satisfaction theory. On the way, we introduce restricted CSPs, i.e., problems of the form CSP$({\mathbb H})$ restricted to yes-instances of CSP$({\mathbb H}')$ -- these were called restricted homomorphism problems by Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. Another main result of this paper presents a P versus NP-complete dichotomy for these problems. Moreover, this complexity dichotomy is accompanied by an algebraic dichotomy in the spirit of the finite domain CSP dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Merge-width and First-Order Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce merge-width, a family of graph parameters that unifies several structural graph measures, including treewidth, degeneracy, twin-width, clique-width, and generalized coloring numbers. Our parameters are based on new decompositions called construction sequences. These are sequences of ever coarser partitions of the vertex set, where each pair of parts has a specified default connection, and all vertex pairs of the graph that differ from the default are marked as resolved. The radius-$r$ merge-width is the maximum number of parts reached from a vertex by following a path of at most $r$ resolved edges. Graph classes of bounded merge-width -- for which the radius-$r$ merge-width parameter can be bounded by a constant, for each fixed $r=1,2,3,\ldots$ -- include all classes of bounded expansion or of bounded twin-width, thus unifying two central notions from the Sparsity and Twin-width frameworks. Furthermore, they are preserved under first-order transductions, which attests to their robustness. We conjecture that classes of bounded merge-width are equivalent to the previously introduced classes of bounded flip-width.
  As our main result, we show that the model checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on graph classes of bounded merge-width, assuming the input includes a witnessing construction sequence. This unites and extends two previous model checking results: the result of Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k, Kr\'{a}l, and Thomas for classes of bounded expansion, and the result of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e, and Watrigant for classes of bounded twin-width.
  Finally, we suggest future research directions that could impact the study of structural and algorithmic graph theory, in particular of monadically dependent graph classes, which we conjecture to coincide with classes of almost bounded merge-width.</description>

      <title>Local iterative algorithms for approximate symmetry guided by network centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the influence of potentially present symmetries has begun to be studied in complex networks. A typical way of studying symmetries is via the automorphism group of the corresponding graph. Since complex networks are often subject to uncertainty and automorphisms are very sensitive to small changes, this characterization needs to be modified to an approximate version for successful application. This paper considers a recently introduced approximate symmetry of complex networks computed as an automorphism with acceptance of small edge preservation error, see Liu 2020. This problem is generally very hard with respect to the large space of candidate permutations, and hence the corresponding computation methods typically lead to the utilization of local algorithms such as the simulated annealing used in the original work. This paper proposes a new heuristic algorithm extending such iterative search algorithm method by using network centralities as heuristics. Centralities are shown to be a good tool to navigate the local search towards more appropriate permutations and lead to better search results.</description>

      <title>Graph Inference with Effective Resistance Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of graph inference is to design algorithms for learning properties of a hidden graph using queries to an oracle that returns information about the graph. Graph reconstruction, verification, and property testing are all types of graph inference.
  In this work, we study graph inference using an oracle that returns the effective resistance (ER) between a pair of vertices. Effective resistance is a distance originating from the study of electrical circuits with many applications. However, ER has received little attention from a graph inference perspective. Indeed, although it is known that an $n$-vertex graph can be uniquely reconstructed from all $\binom{n}{2}$ possible ER queries, little else is known. We address this gap with several new results, including:
  1. $O(n)$-query algorithms for testing whether a graph is a tree; deciding whether two graphs are equal assuming one is a subgraph of the other; and testing whether a given vertex (or edge) is a cut vertex (or cut edge).
  2. Property testing algorithms, including for testing whether a graph is vertex- or edge-biconnected. We also give a reduction to adapt property testing results from the bounded-degree model to our ER query model. This yields ER-query-based algorithms for testing $k$-connectivity, bipartiteness, planarity, and containment of a fixed subgraph.
  3. Graph reconstruction algorithms, including an algorithm for reconstructing a graph from a low-width tree decomposition; a $\Theta(k^2)$-query, polynomial-time algorithm for recovering the adjacency matrix $A$ of a hidden graph, given $A$ with $k$ of its entries deleted; and a $k$-query, exponential-time algorithm for the same task.
  We also compare the power of ER queries and shortest path queries, which are closely related but better studied. Interestingly, we show that the two query models are incomparable in power.</description>

      <title>Property Testing in Bounded Degree Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of property testing on hypergraphs initiated by Czumaj and Sohler (Theoretical Computer Science, 2005). Provided oracle access to a hypergraph, our goal is to distinguish between the case it has a certain property and the case it is "far" from having this property. Here, we assume that hypergraphs are represented by bounded-length incidence lists and we measure distances between them as a fraction of the maximum possible number of hyperedges. This contrasts with previous work where representations were given by adjacency matrices and distances by fractions of all possible vertex tuples. Thus, while the previous model is better for studying dense hypergraphs, ours is more effective for testing those of bounded-degree. In particular, our model can be seen as an extension to hypergraphs of the graph testing framework introduced by Goldreich and Ron (Algorithmica, 2002). In this framework, we analyse the query complexity of three fundamental hypergraph properties: colorability, $k$-partiteness, and independence number. We show that $k$-partiteness within families of $k$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraphs of bounded treewidth is strongly testable. Our algorithm always accepts when the hypergraph is $k$-partite, and rejects with high probability if it is $\varepsilon$-far from $k$-partiteness. In addition, we prove optimal lower bounds of $\Omega(n)$ on the query complexity of testing algorithms for $k$-colorability, $k$-partiteness, and independence number in $k$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraphs of bounded degree. For each of these properties, as an independently interesting combinatorial question, we consider the problem of explicitly constructing $k$-uniform hypergraphs of bounded degree that differ in $\Theta(n)$ hyperedges from any hypergraph satisfying the property, but where violations of the latter cannot be detected in any neighborhood of $o(n)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Unbent Collections of Orthogonal Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in representing single graphs by multiple drawings; for example, using graph stories, storyplans, or uncrossed collections. In this paper, we apply this idea to orthogonal graph drawing. Due to the orthogonal drawing style, we focus on plane 4-graphs, that is, planar graphs of maximum degree 4 whose embedding is fixed. Our goal is to represent any plane 4-graph $G$ by an unbent collection, that is, a collection of orthogonal drawings of $G$ that adhere to the embedding of $G$ and ensure that each edge of $G$ is drawn without bends in at least one of the drawings. We investigate two objectives. First, we consider minimizing the number of drawings in an unbent collection. We prove that every plane 4-graph can be represented by a collection with at most three drawings, which is tight. We also give sufficient conditions for a graph to admit an unbent collection of size 2. Second, we consider minimizing the total number of bends over all drawings in an unbent collection. We show that this problem is NP-hard and give a 3-approximation algorithm. For the special case of plane triconnected cubic graphs, we show how to compute minimum-bend collections in linear time.</description>

      <title>Computability of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subshifts are colorings of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ defined by families of forbidden patterns. Given a subshift and a finite pattern, its extender set is the set of admissible completions of this pattern. It has been conjectured that the behavior of extender sets, and in particular their growth called extender entropy (arXiv:1711.07515), could provide a way to separate the classes of sofic and effective subshifts. We prove here that both classes have the same possible extender entropies: exactly the $\Pi_3$ real numbers of $[0,+\infty)$. We also consider computational properties of extender entropies for subshifts with some language or dynamical properties: computable language, minimal and some mixing properties.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trading of a Charging-Station Company in Auction Markets for Electricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a charging-station company (Chargco) for electric and hydrogen vehicles. The optimal trading of the Chargco in day-ahead and intraday auction markets for electricity is modeled as a stochastic Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). We propose a series of linearization and reformulation techniques to reformulate the stochastic MIQP as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To model stochasticity, we utilize generative adversarial networks to cluster electricity market price scenarios. Additionally, a combination of random forests and linear regression is employed to model the relationship between Chargco electricity and hydrogen loads and their selling prices. Finally, we propose an Improved L-Shaped Decomposition (ILSD) algorithm to solve our stochastic MILP. Our ILSD algorithm not only addresses infeasibilities through an innovative approach but also incorporates warm starts, valid inequalities and multiple generation cuts, thereby reducing computational complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the Chargco trading using our proposed stochastic MILP and its solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Primal-Dual Extension of the Goemans--Williamson Algorithm for the Weighted Fractional Cut-Covering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a weighted generalization of the fractional cut-covering problem, which we relate to the maximum cut problem via antiblocker and gauge duality. This relationship allows us to introduce a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation whose solutions may be rounded into fractional cut covers by sampling via the random hyperplane technique. We then provide a $1/\alpha_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{GW}}$-approximation algorithm for the weighted fractional cut-covering problem, where $\alpha_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{GW}} \approx 0.878$ is the approximation factor of the celebrated Goemans--Williamson algorithm for the maximum cut problem. Nearly optimal solutions of the SDPs in our duality framework allow one to consider instances of the maximum cut and the fractional cut-covering problems as primal-dual pairs, where cuts and fractional cut covers simultaneously certify each other's approximation quality. We exploit this relationship to introduce new combinatorial certificates for both problems, as well as a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for producing such certificates. In~particular, we~show how the Goemans--Williamson algorithm implicitly approximates a weighted instance of the fractional cut-covering problem, and how our new algorithm explicitly approximates a weighted instance of the maximum cut problem. We conclude by discussing the role played by geometric representations of graphs in our results, and by proving our algorithms and analyses to be optimal in several aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>

      <title>SUperman: Efficient Permanent Computation on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The permanent is a function, defined for a square matrix, with applications in various domains including quantum computing, statistical physics, complexity theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Its formula is similar to that of the determinant, however unlike the determinant, its exact computation is #P-complete, i.e., there is no algorithm to compute the permanent in polynomial time unless P=NP. For an $n \times n$ matrix, the fastest algorithm has a time complexity of $O(2^{n-1}n)$. Although supercomputers have been employed for permanent computation before, there is no work and more importantly, no publicly available software that leverages cutting-edge, yet widely accessible, High-Performance Computing accelerators such as GPUs. In this work, we designed, developed, and investigated the performance of SUperman, a complete software suite that can compute matrix permanents on multiple nodes/GPUs on a cluster while handling various matrix types, e.g., real/complex/binary and sparse/dense etc., with a unique treatment for each type. Compared to a state-of-the-art parallel algorithm on 44 cores, SUperman can be $86\times$ faster on a single Nvidia A100 GPU. Combining multiple GPUs, we also showed that SUperman can compute the permanent of a $56 \times 56$ matrix which is the largest reported in the literature.</description>
