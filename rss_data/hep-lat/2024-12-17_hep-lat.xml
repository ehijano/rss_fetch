      <title>Designing weight regularizations based on Lefschetz thimbles to stabilize complex Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex Langevin (CL) method shows significant potential in addressing the numerical sign problem. Nonetheless, it often produces incorrect results when used without any stabilization techniques. Leveraging insights from previous research that links Lefschetz thimbles and CL, we explore a strategy to regularize the CL method to address this issue of incorrect convergence. Specifically, we implement weight regularizations inspired by the associated Lefschetz thimble structure and correct the bias to retrieve the correct results of the original theory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by solving the SU(N) Polyakov chain model and various scalar models, including the cosine model and the one-link model, across a broad range of couplings where the CL method previously failed. We also discuss the potential application of these insights to gauge theories in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>What do we know about the confinement mechanism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color confinement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum chromodynamics. In this work, the mechanisms underlying color confinement are investigated in detail, with a particular focus on the role of non-perturbative phenomena such as center vortices and monopoles in the QCD vacuum. By exploring lattice QCD approaches, including the Maximal Center Gauge and center projection methods, we examine how these topological structures contribute to the confining force between color charges. We also address the limitations of conventional methods and suggest improvements to the gauge fixing prescription to enhance the accuracy of string tension predictions. Our findings support the validity of the center vortex model as a key candidate for understanding the dynamics of the confining QCD vacuum.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Hamiltonian Neural Networks: A Lattice System Analysis Model Based on Structural Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the intricate interactions between particles within a system is a key approach to revealing the essential characteristics of the system, whether it is an in-depth analysis of molecular properties in the field of chemistry or the design of new materials for specific performance requirements in materials science. To this end, we propose Graph Attention Hamiltonian Neural Network (GAHN), a neural network method that can understand the underlying structure of lattice Hamiltonian systems solely through the dynamic trajectories of particles. We can determine which particles in the system interact with each other, the proportion of interactions between different particles, and whether the potential energy of interactions between particles exhibits even symmetry or not. The obtained structure helps the neural network model to continue predicting the trajectory of the system and further understand the dynamic properties of the system. In addition to understanding the underlying structure of the system, it can be used for detecting lattice structural abnormalities, such as link defects, abnormal interactions, etc. These insights benefit system optimization, design, and detection of aging or damage. Moreover, this approach can integrate other components to deduce the link structure needed for specific parts, showcasing its scalability and potential. We tested it on a challenging molecular dynamics dataset, and the results proved its ability to accurately infer molecular bond connectivity, highlighting its scientific research potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum sampling on a quantum annealer for large volumes in the strong coupling limit for gauge group U(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous studies [1, 2], we confirmed that a quantum annealer can be used for importance sampling of gauge theories. In this paper, we extend the previous results to larger 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional lattices to generate ensembles for U(3) gauge theory in the strong coupling limit. We make use of the D-Wave quantum annealer to generate histograms for sub-lattices, and use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to determine thermodynamic observables and their dependence on the physical parameters on large volumes. We benchmark our results to those obtained from classical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Likelihood of a zero in the proton elastic electric form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with the $29$ available data on the ratio of proton electric and magnetic form factors, $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/ G_M^p(Q^2)$, and independent of any model or theory of strong interactions, we use the Schlessinger point method to objectively address the question of whether the ratio possesses a zero and, if so, its location. Our analysis predicts that, with 50% confidence, the data are consistent with the existence of a zero in the ratio on $Q^2 \leq 10.37\,$GeV$^2$. The level of confidence increases to $99.9$\% on $Q^2 \leq 13.06\,$GeV$^2$. Significantly, the likelihood that existing data are consistent with the absence of a zero in the ratio on $Q^2 \leq 14.49\,$GeV$^2$ is $1/1$-million.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of Rydberg atoms in a two-leg rectangular ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm, we map the ground-state phase diagram of a two-leg Rydberg ladder array with lattice spacings $a_x=2a_y$. We identify various density wave phases that spontaneously break the translational symmetry or the top-bottom reflection symmetry within the ladder. By increasing the laser detuning from zero, where the system is in a disordered phase that preserves all symmetries, we observe density wave orders with spontaneous breaking of the translational $\mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetries at intermediate detuning values, while the reflection symmetry is preserved. These orders exhibit nonzero bond orders with positive expectation values on every $p$th rung, thus labeled as $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ phases. At larger detuning values, another spontaneous breaking of the reflection symmetry, which disrupted the bond orders on the rungs, occurs via an Ising phase transition. In these phases, either the top or the bottom site is occupied in a staggered way on every $p$th rung, breaking the translational $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ symmetry, thus labeled by $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ phases. We locate and characterize the 3-state Potts point and Ashkin-Teller point along the commensurate lines, as well as the direct chiral phase transitions between the disordered phase and the $\mathbb{Z}_p^+$ ($p = 3, 4$) phases. Critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$ are calculated for both conformal and chiral phase transition points. We finally identify two types of floating phases in the phase diagram: one characterized by a quasi-long-range incommensurate bond-order wave, and the other by a quasi-long-range incommensurate wave of density differences in the rungs. Our work motivates further applications of Rydberg atom arrays in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a fractal inspired coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasino model is modified by the inclusion of a running-coupling that was obtained by a fractal approach to Quantum Chromodynamics. The coupling follows a $q$-exponential function and, in the context of high energy collisions, explains the origin of the Tsallis non-extensive statistics distributions. The parameter $q$ is completely determined in terms of the number of colours and the number of quark flavours. We study several aspects of the extended model and compare our results to the standard NJL model, where a constant coupling is used in combination with a sharp cutoff to regularize the gap equation. We show that the modified coupling regularizes the model in a smooth cutoff fashion and reproduces the pion mass and decay constant, providing an almost identical Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation as in the standard NJL model. In both models the relation is satisfied in similar cutoff scales. An important novelty of this work is the physical explanation, in terms of the fractal QCD vacuum, for a running coupling that renormalizes the quark condensate.</description>

      <title>Three ways to decipher the nature of exotic hadrons: multiplets, three-body hadronic molecules, and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, a plethora of hadronic states beyond the conventional quark model of $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons have been observed experimentally, which motivated extensive studies to understand their nature and the non-perturbative strong interaction. Since most of these exotic states are near the mass thresholds of a pair of conventional hadrons, the prevailing picture is that they are primarily hadronic molecules. In principle, one can verify the molecular nature of these states by thoroughly comparing their masses, decay widths, and production rates in a particular picture with experimental data. However, this is difficult or impossible. First, quantum mechanics allows for the mixing of configurations allowed by symmetries and quantum numbers. Second, data are relatively scarce because of their small production rates and the many difficulties in the experimental measurements. As a result, other alternatives need to be explored. This review summarizes three such approaches that can help disentangle the nature of the many exotic hadrons discovered. In the first approach, based on the molecular interpretations for some exotic states, we study the likely existence of multiplets of hadronic molecules related by various symmetries, such as isospin symmetry, SU(3)-flavor symmetry, heavy quark spin/flavor symmetry, and heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. In the second approach, starting from some hadronic molecular candidates, one can derive the underlying hadron-hadron interactions. With these interactions, one can study related three-body systems and check whether three-body bound states/resonances exist. In the third approach, one can turn to the femtoscopy technique to derive the hadron-hadron interactions, hence inaccessible. This technique provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the interactions between unstable hadrons.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>
