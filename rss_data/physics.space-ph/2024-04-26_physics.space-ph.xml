      <title>Resonance of low-frequency electromagnetic and ion-sound modes in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe measurements have recently shown that coherent fast magnetosonic and Alfv\'{e}n ion-cyclotron waves are abundant in the solar wind and can be accompanied by higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations. In this letter we reveal the nonlinear process capable of channelling the energy of low-frequency electromagnetic to higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations observed aboard Parker Solar Probe. We present Hall-MHD simulations demonstrating that low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuations can resonate with the ion-sound mode, which results in steepening of plasma density fluctuations, electrostatic spikes and harmonics in the electric field spectrum. The resonance can occur around the wavenumber determined by the ratio between local sound and Alfv\'{e}n speeds, but only in the case of {\it oblique} propagation to the background magnetic field. The resonance wavenumber, its width and steepening time scale are estimated, and all indicate that the revealed two-wave resonance can frequently occur in the solar wind. This process can be a potential channel of energy transfer from cyclotron resonant ions producing the electromagnetic fluctuations to Landau resonant ions and electrons absorbing the energy of the higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Phase and morphology of water-ice grains formed in a cryogenic laboratory plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grains of ice are formed spontaneously when water vapor is injected into a weakly-ionized laboratory plasma in which the background gas has been cooled to cryogenic temperatures comparable to those of deep space. These ice grains are levitated indefinitely within the plasma so that their time evolution can be observed under free-floating conditions. Using microscope imaging, ice grains are shown to have a spindle-like fractal structure and grow over time. Both crystalline and amorphous phases of ice are observed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A mix of crystalline and amorphous grains coexist under certain thermal conditions and a linear mixing model is used on the ice absorption band surrounding 3.2 microns to examine the ice phase composition and its temporal stability. The extinction spectrum is also affected by inelastic scattering as grains grow, and characteristic grain radii are obtained from Mie scattering theory and compared to size measurements from direct imaging. Observations are used to compare possible ice nucleation mechanisms, and it is concluded that nucleation is likely catalyzed by ions, as ice does not nucleate in absence of plasma and impurities are not detected. Ice grain properties and infrared extinction spectra show similarity to observations of some astrophysical ices observed in protoplanetary disks, implying that the fractal morphology of the ice and observed processes of homogeneous ice nucleation could occur as well in such astrophysical environments with weakly-ionized conditions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Density Fluctuations in the Solar Wind at 1 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known property of solar wind plasma turbulence is the observed anisotropy of the autocorrelations, or equivalently the spectra, of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Here we explore the related but apparently not well-studied issue of the anisotropy of plasma density fluctuations in the energy-containing and inertial ranges of solar wind turbulence. Using 10 years (1998-2008) of in situ data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) mission, we find that for all but the fastest wind category, the density correlation scale is slightly larger in directions quasi-parallel to the large-scale mean magnetic field as compared to quasi-perpendicular directions. The correlation scale in fast wind is consistent with isotropic. The anisotropy as a function of the level of correlation is also explored. We find at small correlation levels, i.e., at energy-containing scales and larger, the density fluctuations are close to isotropy for fast wind, and slightly favor more rapid decorrelation in perpendicular directions for slow and medium winds. At relatively smaller (inertial range) scales where the correlation values are larger, the sense of anisotropy is reversed in all speed ranges, implying a more "slab-like" structure, especially prominent in the fast wind samples. We contrast this finding with published results on velocity and magnetic field correlations.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first towards and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>
