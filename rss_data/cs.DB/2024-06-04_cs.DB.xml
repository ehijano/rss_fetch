      <title>Recent Advances in Data-Driven Business Process Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of cutting-edge technologies, the increasing volume of data and also the availability and processability of new types of data sources has led to a paradigm shift in data-based management and decision-making. Since business processes are at the core of organizational work, these developments heavily impact BPM as a crucial success factor for organizations. In view of this emerging potential, data-driven business process management has become a relevant and vibrant research area. Given the complexity and interdisciplinarity of the research field, this position paper therefore presents research insights regarding data-driven BPM.</description>

      <title>GRAM: Generative Retrieval Augmented Matching of Data Schemas in the Context of Data Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schema matching constitutes a pivotal phase in the data ingestion process for contemporary database systems. Its objective is to discern pairwise similarities between two sets of attributes, each associated with a distinct data table. This challenge emerges at the initial stages of data analytics, such as when incorporating a third-party table into existing databases to inform business insights. Given its significance in the realm of database systems, schema matching has been under investigation since the 2000s. This study revisits this foundational problem within the context of large language models. Adhering to increasingly stringent data security policies, our focus lies on the zero-shot and few-shot scenarios: the model should analyze only a minimal amount of customer data to execute the matching task, contrasting with the conventional approach of scrutinizing the entire data table. We emphasize that the zero-shot or few-shot assumption is imperative to safeguard the identity and privacy of customer data, even at the potential cost of accuracy. The capability to accurately match attributes under such stringent requirements distinguishes our work from previous literature in this domain.</description>

      <title>D2E-An Autonomous Decision-making Dataset involving Driver States and Human Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technology, data-driven methods are increasingly used in the decision-making of autonomous driving, and the quality of datasets greatly influenced the model performance. Although current datasets have made significant progress in the collection of vehicle and environment data, emphasis on human-end data including the driver states and human evaluation is not sufficient. In addition, existing datasets consist mostly of simple scenarios such as car following, resulting in low interaction levels. In this paper, we introduce the Driver to Evaluation dataset (D2E), an autonomous decision-making dataset that contains data on driver states, vehicle states, environmental situations, and evaluation scores from human reviewers, covering a comprehensive process of vehicle decision-making. Apart from regular agents and surrounding environment information, we not only collect driver factor data including first-person view videos, physiological signals, and eye attention data, but also provide subjective rating scores from 40 human volunteers. The dataset is mixed of driving simulator scenes and real-road ones. High-interaction situations are designed and filtered to ensure behavior diversity. Through data organization, analysis, and preprocessing, D2E contains over 1100 segments of interactive driving case data covering from human driver factor to evaluation results, supporting the development of data-driven decision-making related algorithms.</description>

      <title>Measure-Observe-Remeasure: An Interactive Paradigm for Differentially-Private Exploratory Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has the potential to enable privacy-preserving analysis on sensitive data, but requires analysts to judiciously spend a limited ``privacy loss budget'' $\epsilon$ across queries. Analysts conducting exploratory analyses do not, however, know all queries in advance and seldom have DP expertise. Thus, they are limited in their ability to specify $\epsilon$ allotments across queries prior to an analysis. To support analysts in spending $\epsilon$ efficiently, we propose a new interactive analysis paradigm, Measure-Observe-Remeasure, where analysts ``measure'' the database with a limited amount of $\epsilon$, observe estimates and their errors, and remeasure with more $\epsilon$ as needed.
  We instantiate the paradigm in an interactive visualization interface which allows analysts to spend increasing amounts of $\epsilon$ under a total budget. To observe how analysts interact with the Measure-Observe-Remeasure paradigm via the interface, we conduct a user study that compares the utility of $\epsilon$ allocations and findings from sensitive data participants make to the allocations and findings expected of a rational agent who faces the same decision task. We find that participants are able to use the workflow relatively successfully, including using budget allocation strategies that maximize over half of the available utility stemming from $\epsilon$ allocation. Their loss in performance relative to a rational agent appears to be driven more by their inability to access information and report it than to allocate $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>PeFAD: A Parameter-Efficient Federated Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of mobile sensing techniques, huge amounts of time series data are generated and accumulated in various domains, fueling plenty of real-world applications. In this setting, time series anomaly detection is practically important. It endeavors to identify deviant samples from the normal sample distribution in time series. Existing approaches generally assume that all the time series is available at a central location. However, we are witnessing the decentralized collection of time series due to the deployment of various edge devices. To bridge the gap between the decentralized time series data and the centralized anomaly detection algorithms, we propose a Parameter-efficient Federated Anomaly Detection framework named PeFAD with the increasing privacy concerns. PeFAD for the first time employs the pre-trained language model (PLM) as the body of the client's local model, which can benefit from its cross-modality knowledge transfer capability. To reduce the communication overhead and local model adaptation cost, we propose a parameter-efficient federated training module such that clients only need to fine-tune small-scale parameters and transmit them to the server for update. PeFAD utilizes a novel anomaly-driven mask selection strategy to mitigate the impact of neglected anomalies during training. A knowledge distillation operation on a synthetic privacy-preserving dataset that is shared by all the clients is also proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue across clients. We conduct extensive evaluations on four real datasets, where PeFAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines by up to 28.74\%.</description>

      <title>PANDA: Query Evaluation in Submodular Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02001v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several information-theoretic upper bounds have been introduced on the output size and evaluation cost of database join queries. These bounds vary in their power depending on both the type of statistics on input relations and the query plans that they support. This motivated the search for algorithms that can compute the output of a join query in times that are bounded by the corresponding information-theoretic bounds. In this paper, we describe PANDA, an algorithm that takes a Shannon-inequality that underlies the bound, and translates each proof step into an algorithmic step corresponding to some database operation. PANDA computes answers to a conjunctive query in time given by the the submodular width plus the output size of the query. The version in this paper represents a significant simplification of the original version [ANS, PODS'17].</description>

      <title>CompanyKG: A Large-Scale Heterogeneous Graph for Company Similarity Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the investment industry, it is often essential to carry out fine-grained company similarity quantification for a range of purposes, including market mapping, competitor analysis, and mergers and acquisitions. We propose and publish a knowledge graph, named CompanyKG, to represent and learn diverse company features and relations. Specifically, 1.17 million companies are represented as nodes enriched with company description embeddings; and 15 different inter-company relations result in 51.06 million weighted edges. To enable a comprehensive assessment of methods for company similarity quantification, we have devised and compiled three evaluation tasks with annotated test sets: similarity prediction, competitor retrieval and similarity ranking. We present extensive benchmarking results for 11 reproducible predictive methods categorized into three groups: node-only, edge-only, and node+edge. To the best of our knowledge, CompanyKG is the first large-scale heterogeneous graph dataset originating from a real-world investment platform, tailored for quantifying inter-company similarity.</description>
