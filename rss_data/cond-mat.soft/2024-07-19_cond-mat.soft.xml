      <title>Smart polymer solution and thermal conductivity: How important is an exact polymer conformation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat management in devices is a key to their efficiency and longevity. Here, thermal switches (TS) are of great importance because of their ability to transition between different thermal conductivity $\kappa$ states. While traditional TS are bulky and slow, recent experiments have suggested "smart" responsive (bio--inspired) polymers as their fast alternatives. One example is poly(N--isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) in water, where $\kappa$ drops suddenly around a temperature $T_{\ell} \simeq 305$ K when a PNIPAM undergoes a coil--to--globule transition. At a first glance, this may suggest that the change in polymer conformation has a direct influence on TS. However, it may be presumptuous to trivially "only" link conformations with TS, especially because many complex microscopic details control macroscopic conformational transition. Motivated by this, we study TS in "smart" polymers using generic simulations. As the test cases, we investigate two different modes of polymer collapse using external stimuli, i.e., changing $T$ and cosolvent mole fraction $x_{\rm c}$. Collapse upon increasing $T$ shows a direct correlation between the conformation and $\kappa$ switching, while no correlation is observed in the latter case. These results suggest that the (co--)solvent--monomer interactions play a greater important role than the exact conformation in dictating TS. While some results are compared with the available experiments, possible future directions are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Capillary lubrication of a spherical particle near a fluid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lubricated motion of an object near a deformable boundary presents striking subtleties arising from the coupling between the elasticity of the boundary and lubricated flow, including but not limited to the emergence of a lift force acting on the object despite the zero Reynolds number. In this study, we characterize the hydrodynamic forces and torques felt by a sphere translating in close proximity to a fluid interface, separating the viscous medium of the sphere's motion from an infinitely-more-viscous medium. We employ lubrication theory and perform a perturbation analysis in capillary compliance. The dominant response of the interface owing to surface tension results in a long-ranged interface deformation, which leads to a modification of the forces and torques with respect to the rigid reference case, that we characterise in details with scaling arguments and numerical integrations.</description>

      <title>Transient segregation of different density granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-dependent density segregation of granular mixtures flowing over an inclined plane. Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations in a periodic box are performed for granular mixtures of same size and different density particles flowing under the influence of gravity. In addition, a continuum model is developed to solve the momentum balance equations along with species transport equation by accounting for the inter-coupling of segregation and rheology. The particle force-based density segregation theory has been used along with the $\mu-I$ rheology to predict evolution of flow properties with time for binary and multicomponent mixtures. The effect of particle arrangements on the transient evolution of flow properties for three different initial configurations is investigated using both continuum and DEM simulations. Continuum predictions for various flow properties of interest such as species concentration, velocity, pressure, and shear stress at different time instants are compared with DEM simulations. The results from the discrete and continuum models are found to be in good agreement with each other for well-mixed and heavy-near-base initial configurations. However, the continuum model is unable to predict the flow evolution for the light-near-base initial configuration. DEM simulations reveal the presence of an instability driven, quick segregation for this configuration which is not predicted by the one dimensional model and requires generalization to three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Tuning collective actuation of active solids by optimizing activity localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active solids, more specifically elastic lattices embedded with polar active units, exhibit collective actuation when the elasto-active feedback, generically present in such systems, exceeds some critical value. The dynamics then condensates on a small fraction of the vibrational modes, the selection of which obeys non trivial rules rooted in the nonlinear part of the dynamics. So far the complexity of the selection mechanism has limited the design of specific actuation. Here we investigate numerically how, localizing the activity on a fraction of modes, one can select non-trivial collective actuation. We perform numerical simulations of an agent based model on triangular and disordered lattices and vary the concentration and the localization of the active agents on the lattices nodes. Both contribute to the distribution of the elastic energy across the modes. We then introduce an algorithm, which, for a given fraction of active nodes, evolves the localization of the activity in such a way that the energy distribution on a few targeted modes is maximized -- or minimized. We illustrate on a specific targeted actuation, how the algorithm performs as compared to manually chosen localization of the activity. While, in the case of the ordered lattice, a well educated guess performs better than the algorithm, the latter outperform the manual trials in the case of the disordered lattice. Finally, the analysis of the results in the case of the ordered lattice leads us to introduce a design principle based on a measure of the susceptibility of the modes to be activated along certain activation paths.</description>

      <title>Characterizing hydrogel behavior under compression with gel-freezing osmometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogels are particularly versatile materials that are widely found in both Nature and industry. One key reason for this versatility is their high water content, which lets them dramatically change their volume and many of their mechanical properties -- often by orders of magnitude -- as they swell and dry out. Currently, we lack techniques that can precisely characterize how these properties change with water content. To overcome this challenge, here we develop Gel-Freezing Osmometry (GelFrO): an extension of freezing-point osmometry. We show how GelFrO can measure a hydrogel's mechanical response to compression and osmotic pressure, while only using small, $O(100\mu$L$)$ samples. Because the technique allows measurement of properties over an unusually wide range of water contents, it allows us to accurately test theoretical predictions. We find simple, power-law behavior for both mechanical response to compression, and osmotic pressure, while these are not well-captured by classical Flory-Huggins theory. We interpret this power-law behavior as a hallmark of a microscopic fractal structure of the gel's polymer network, and propose a simple way to connect the gel's fractal dimension to its mechanical and osmotic properties. This connection is supported by observations of hydrogel microstructures using small-angle x-ray scattering. Finally, our results motivate us to propose an updated constitutive model describing hydrogel swelling, and mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Growing tissue sheets on substrates: buds, buckles, and pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many tissues take the form of thin sheets, being only a single cell thick, but millions of cells wide. These tissue sheets can bend and buckle in the third dimension. In this work, we investigated the growth of suspended and supported tissue sheets using particle-based simulations. We combine particle-based tissue growth and meshless membrane models to simulate the growth of tissue sheets with mechanical feedback. Free suspended growing tissues exhibit wrinkling when growth is sufficiently fast. Conversely, tissues on a substrate form buds when the adhesion to the substrate is weak and/or when the friction with the substrate is strong. These buds undergo a membrane-mediated attraction and subsequently fuse. The complete detachment of tissues from the substrate and straight buckled bump formation are also obtained at very weak adhesion and/or fast growth rates. Tissue pores grow via Ostwald ripening and coalescence. The reported dynamics can also be applied in research on the detachment dynamics of different tissues with weakened adhesion.</description>

      <title>Water drop impact on thin viscous oil layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted experimental investigations into the short-term and long-term impact dynamics of pure water drops on silicone oil-coated surfaces. Our observations revealed distinct phases: initially, rapid maximal spreading followed by retraction, subsequent oscillations characterized by a relatively stable contact angle, and a final phase involved the gradual spreading of the drop on the underlying solid surface due to the rupturing of the oil layer. The maximal spreading radius follows $We^{1/4}$ scaling, where $We$ is the Weber number, independent of the viscosity of the underlying oil layer. By introducing fluorescent tracer particles in the oil, we noted that the drop expanded over the oil layer during the initial spreading without displacing oil. Subsequently, as the oscillations dampen, the drop ruptures the oil layer, initiating a dewetting process and spreads over the solid surface, leaving a tiny oil droplet under the water drop. Upon completion of this dewetting process, the onset time for the drop spreading nonlinearly increased with the oil layer thickness as $\sim d_o^2$, which we attribute to the dewetting dynamics. Our findings unveil intriguing dynamics of water drops impacting on oil-coated surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Dance of Odd-Diffusive Particles: A Fourier Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd-diffusive systems are characterized by transverse responses and exhibit unconventional behaviors in interacting systems. To address the dynamical interparticle rearrangements in a minimal system, we here exactly solve the problem of two hard disk-like interacting odd-diffusing particles. We calculate the probability density function (PDF) of the interacting particles in the Fourier-Laplace domain and find that oddness rotates all modes except the zeroth, resembling a ``mutual rolling'' of interacting odd particles. We show that only the first Fourier mode of the PDF, the polarization, enters the calculation of the force autocorrelation function (FACF) for generic systems with central-force interactions. An analysis of the polarization as a function of time reveals that the relative rotation angle between interacting particles overshoots before relaxation, thereby rationalizing the recently observed oscillating FACF in odd-diffusive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the buckling of a clamped beam immersed in a creeping flow within a rectangular channel. Via a combination of precision experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show how the instability depends on a pressure feedback mechanism and rationalize it in terms of dimensionless parameters. As the beam can bend until touching the wall above a critical flow rate, we finally demonstrate how the system can be used as a tunable passive flow selector, effectively redirecting the flow within a designed hydraulic circuit.</description>

      <title>Modeling drop deformations and rheology of dilute to dense emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight the current state-of-the-art in modeling emulsion rheology, ranging from dilute to jammed dense systems. We focus on analytical and numerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop deformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions. We identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small deformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list theoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing connections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.</description>
