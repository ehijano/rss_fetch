      <title>Black hole Near Horizons through the Looking Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the near horizon of a generic non-extremal black hole (BH) can be understood in terms of a Carrollian geometry with two null directions, also called a String-Carroll (SC) geometry. The base space of this fibre-bundle structure is a sphere (or a plane for a black brane) and the fibre is the two-dimensional Rindler spacetime. We launch a detailed study of probes in this geometry. We study particle geodesics and scalar fields. The first part of the paper constructs geodesics and probe scalar fields directly in the SC geometry. We then look at a wide class of examples, including the Schwarzschild BH and the Kerr BH in asymptotically flat spacetimes, the BTZ BH and the black brane in AdS spacetimes, as well as Lifshitz black holes and construct the explicit maps to the SC geometry to obtain results specific to each case. These results are reproduced by considering the probe particles and fields in the original BH background and taking the near-horizon limit of the solutions. Our encyclopedia of examples establishes the notion of SC geometries as near-horizon geometries of non-extremal black objects, paving the way for a detailed, intricate future analysis of the quantum aspects of this geometry.</description>

      <title>Null fluid/gravity correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new class of perturbative asymptotically Anti-de Sitter pp-wave spacetimes by performing a long-wavelength expansion of Kaigorodov metrics in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Holographically, these spacetimes are described by a null fluid hydrodynamic expansion around null states in the conformal field theory, which can be obtained as zero temperature and infinite momentum limits of finite temperature states. Building on this, we explicitly show that special cases of this null fluid/gravity correspondence can be obtained as an ultra-relativistic limit of the usual fluid/gravity correspondence in which the temperature tends to zero while the flow approaches the speed of light. We also extend these results to the context of the blackfold approach in which the corresponding pp-wave spacetimes are asymptotically flat and can be obtained as infinite temperature limits of boosted black branes.</description>

      <title>Universal Functions for Topological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider correlation functions of topologically twisted, $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group ${\rm SU}(2)$ and $N_f\leq 3$ massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. For a smooth, compact, oriented four-manifold $X$ with $b_2^+&gt;1$, the correlation functions are expressed in terms of a finite set of universal functions. The mass dependence of these functions encodes intersection numbers of the moduli space of instantons. We determine closed expressions for the universal functions by combining techniques of the Seiberg-Witten geometry, $u$-plane integral and the blowup formula. If $X$ is specialised to a complex algebraic surface $S$, the correlation functions can be identified with generating functions of Segre invariants for moduli spaces of sheaves on $S$. We verify that our results agree with the results by G\"ottsche and Kool for these generating functions.</description>

      <title>A Two-Point Hologram for Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Known holographic dictionaries, especially AdS/CFT, rely on symmetry matching between the bulk and the boundary. We take a step toward a holographic dictionary with no symmetry requirement and without assuming the geometry being asymptotically AdS. Starting from any interacting Majorana generalized free field on a $(0+1)$d boundary and its two-point function data, we derive a concise analytic formula for the dual $(1+1)$d bulk geometry, borrowing techniques from unitary matrix integral and inverse scattering. Using this formula, we compute the near-horizon curvature, give conditions for positive versus negative curvature, and identify simple boundary models with de Sitter or anti-de Sitter near-horizon duals. We also study the large-$q$ SYK model, finding an unusual temperature dependence of the near-horizon curvature, related to the discrepancy between physical temperature and the ``fake disk'' temperature. We also construct, directly from boundary operators, approximate algebras generated by null translations and boost that become exact at the bifurcate horizon.</description>

      <title>Coherent quantum hairy black holes from gravitational decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum description of hairy black holes within gravitational decoupling (GD) is developed using coherent graviton states. Classical geometry emerges as the mean-field limit of a finite graviton condensate, while quantum fluctuations introduce a short-distance regulator. We construct a coherent quantum GD hairy black hole metric by Gaussian smearing the gravitational potential, with an effective width that encodes the size of the quantum core. The resulting geometry is free of curvature singularities over appropriate parameter ranges and exhibits modified horizon structures. The effective stress-energy tensor is derived, the energy conditions are analyzed, and the Misner-Sharp mass is computed. We investigate geodesics in the coherent quantum GD hairy black hole geometry, with relevant deviations from the RN case. Photon rings, critical impact parameters, and light deflection exhibit measurable strong-field modifications, allowing observational constraints on deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Thou shalt not tunnel: Complex instantons and tunneling suppression in deformed quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantization of the Seiberg-Witten curve of ${\cal N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory leads to a deformation of one-dimensional quantum mechanics with unconventional behavior. Most notably, quantum tunneling is suppressed at special points in parameter space. In this paper we examine these deformed models in the case of double-well and cubic potentials, and we find that they have a rich phase structure. In what we call the strong coupling phase, the theory behaves like conventional quantum mechanics, instantons are real, and tunneling is not suppressed. In the weak coupling phase, the instantons responsible for tunneling become complex, and tunneling suppression takes place at the so-called Toda lattice points. At the critical point between the two phases, which corresponds to a monopole point in super Yang-Mills theory, the non-perturbative amplitudes display an anomalous scaling as a function of $\hbar$. This phase structure reflects the physics of the underlying super Yang-Mills theory and can be regarded as a physical manifestation of wall-crossing behavior of the BPS spectrum, which we determine in our problem by using resurgent techniques.</description>

      <title>Correlator-Level Verification of Mass and Current Maps in Abelian Chern-Simons Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit local operator realization that reproduces Dirac fermion correlation functions in three spacetime dimensions within an Abelian Chern-Simons framework and use it to examine the conjectured operator and deformation maps of fermion-boson duality directly at the level of correlation functions.
  We show that the predicted relation between bosonic and fermionic mass deformations, including the relative sign, is realized quantitatively, and that the fermionic U(1) current coincides with the topological gauge current inside correlation functions at the infrared fixed point. These results provide a direct correlator-level verification of key features of Abelian Chern-Simons dualities, going beyond arguments based solely on phase structure, anomaly matching, or large-N considerations.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ Hilbert Spaces of Bilocal Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For vector/AdS and dS holography we establish the structure of the emergent Hilbert space. This is done through implementation of finite $N$ trace relations on the infinite collective space. For fermionic theories a finite Hilbert space is established, while for bosonic theories a space of freely acting primaries multiplied by a finite set of secondaries emerges. The Hilbert space of states obey finite $N$ cut off bounds, implying finiteness of traces and entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the holographic timelike entanglement entropy with the pseudo-entropy arising from a two-qubit quantum mechanical system. In this model, we consider transitions from an initial thermal state to a final thermal state at fixed temperature under the influence of an external magnetic field. Our findings highlight significant discrepancies between the two quantities, which display markedly different behavior.</description>

      <title>Duality symmetry and dynamics on finite null boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a set of boost-weighted $w$ functionals of the metric, with $w\in\{2,1,0,-1,-2\}$, which transform semi-covariantly under the action of the near-horizon symmetry group. In particular, we demonstrate that the knowledge of the $w=-2$ metric functional and its behaviour under the near-horizon symmetry transformations allows us to derive the expressions and the properties of the remaining boost-weighted functionals via a recursive pattern. A similar recursive pattern also appears when evaluating the action of the near-horizon symmetry group on the evolution equations of these boost-weighted functionals. Again, the knowledge of the evolution equation of the boost $w=-2$ functional and its behaviour under symmetry transformations allows the remaining evolution equations to be determined using symmetry arguments. We also emphasize the role played by the duality symmetry in the characterization of the phase space of a null boundary and in the evaluation of the equation of motion. In conclusion, we derive the sub-leading Noether charges in the Einstein-Cartan-Holst formulation of gravity, showing that the imaginary part of the Weyl scalar $\Psi_2$ appears at the sub-leading order in the Holst charge.</description>

Abstract: We review the original argument of Lehmann et al (LSZ) that relates the flat space S-matrix to the correlation function of field operators and clarify some confusing issues. Next we discuss the origin of the $i\epsilon$ prescriptions following Weinberg, but without assuming that the vacuum is free at asymptotic times. Then we discuss the corresponding argument in inflationary cosmology, emphasizing that unitarity violating contour deformations are unnecessary.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Maxwell extension of kinematical Lie algebras by promoting the contraction method underlying the Bacry and L\'evy-Leblond cube to a semigroup expansion framework. Within this approach, we show that both non- and ultra-relativistic Maxwell algebras admitting non-degenerate invariant bilinear forms can be systematically obtained from different parent algebras through a unified expansion scheme, leading to a Maxwellian kinematical cube. This construction is further generalized to an infinite hierarchy of kinematical algebras. The expansion method naturally provides the corresponding invariant tensors, allowing for the systematic construction of three-dimensional Chern-Simons gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Self-duality of massless scalar three-point amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that massless scalar three-point amplitudes are self-dual under Fourier transformation. This implies that the momentum space amplitude can be expressed as the position space amplitude of the same graph with transformed edge-weights (not the dual graph) if external vertices are labeled accordingly. In particular, a massless scalar three-point integral can be expressed as a graphical function. The result follows immediately from a theorem by M. Golz, E. Panzer and the author on parametric representations of position space integrals (2015), but it was only observed by X. Jiang in 2025 in the context of four-dimensional Super-Yang-Mills theory. We generalize Jiang's result and discuss the consequences of the self-duality in the context of graphical functions. In particular, we derive a new identity for graphical functions and a new twist relation for scalar integrals (Feynman periods) in $\phi^4$ theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonians ${\cal H}^{a}_k$ of new integrable systems associated with the integer rays $(1,a)$ (commutative subalgebras) of Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra in the $N$-body representation are closely related to commuting twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians $\mathfrak{C}_i^{(a)}$, ${\cal H}^{a}_k = \sum_{i=1}^N (\mathfrak{C}_i^{(a)})^k$. Moreover, symmetric combinations of eigenfunctions in the twisted Cherednik system were recently shown to produce the DIM Hamiltonian eigenstates. We explicitly construct these twisted Cherednik eigenfunctions recurrently by action of some (creation and permutation) operations. It resembles of a far-going generalization of Kirillov-Noumi operators, but exact relation remains to be specified.</description>

      <title>Geometric QCD II: The Confining Twistor String and Meson Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuum framework for confining planar QCD ($N_c\to\infty$) by quantizing the Fermi-string (1981) degrees of freedom on the rigid Hodge-dual minimal surface of Geometric QCD I. Worldsheet Majorana fermions provide the algebraic mechanism required by the Makeenko-Migdal loop equations: the Pauli principle cancels non-planar self-intersections, preserving planar factorization. The Liouville instability of random surfaces is avoided since the bulk geometry is rigidly fixed holographically by the boundary loop, without summing over fluctuating metrics.
  Formulating the theory in momentum loop space integrates out coordinate-space cusp singularities, yielding a finite local limit for quark-loop amplitudes. Changing variables in the phase-space path integral, after fixing reparametrization symmetry (Virasoro constraint), parametrizes the reduced measure by boundary twistors and an induced Jacobian. This yields a twistor-string integral derived directly from the planar QCD amplitude.
  In the local limit, the theory becomes an analytic twistor string: a boundary sigma model $S^1\to (S^3\times S^3)/S^1$ coupled to a holographically determined Liouville field $\rho(z,\bar z)=\log(|\lambda(z)||\mu(z)|)$ obtained by analytic continuation of boundary twistor data.
  The meson spectrum is encoded in a 1D functional integral over the boundary twistor trajectory $\lambda(z),\mu(z)$ on $|z|=1$. While evaluated numerically via a reweighted Complex Langevin approach (extracting linear Regge trajectories as a proof of concept), our ultimate finding is analytical. Analyzing complexified effective action monodromies reveals the discrete mass spectrum is exactly governed by Catastrophe Theory and classified by the topological number of twistor poles inside the unit circle. The 1-pole sector exactly yields $m^2 = \pi \sigma (n + 1/12)$.</description>

      <title>Mott Criticality as the Confinement Transition of a Pseudogap-Mott Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Mott insulation involves the localization of itinerant electrons due to strong local repulsion. Upon doping, a pseudogap (PG) phase emerges - marked by selective gapping of the Fermi surface without conventional symmetry breaking in spin or charge channels. A key challenge is understanding how quasiparticle breakdown in the Fermi liquid gives rise to this enigmatic state, and how it connects to both the Mott insulating and superconducting phases. Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly correlated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase and its transition to a Mott insulator. Applying a many-body tiling scheme to the fixed-point impurity model uncovers a lattice model with electron interactions and Kondo physics. At half-filling, the interplay between Kondo screening and bath charge fluctuations in the impurity model leads to Fermi liquid breakdown. This reveals a pseudogap phase characterized by a non-Fermi liquid (the Mott metal) residing on nodal arcs, gapped antinodal regions of the Fermi surface, and an anomalous scaling of the electronic scattering rate with frequency. The eventual confinement of holon-doublon excitations of this exotic metal obtains a continuous transition into the Mott insulator. Our results identify the pseudogap as a distinct long-range entangled quantum phase, and offer a new route to Mott criticality beyond the paradigm of local quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Elliptic mirror of the quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toroidal sigma models of magneto-transport are analyzed, in which integer and fractional quantum Hall effects automatically are unified by a {holomorphic modular symmetry}. By exploiting a quantum equivalence called \emph{mirror symmetry}, these models are mapped to tractable mirror models (also elliptic), in which topological protection is provided by more familiar winding numbers. Phase diagrams and scaling properties of elliptic models are compared to some of the experimental and numerical data accumulated over the past three decades. The geometry of scaling flows extracted from quantum Hall experiments is in good agreement with modular predictions, including the location of many quantum critical points. One conspicuous model %(arguably the simplest and most natural one) has a critical delocalization exponent $\nu_{\rm tor} = 18 \ln 2 /(\pi^2 G^4) = 2.6051\dots$ ($G$ is Gauss' constant) that is in excellent agreement with the value $\nu_{\rm num} = 2.607\pm\,.004$ calculated in the numerical Chalker-Coddington model, suggesting that these models are in the same universality class. The real delocalization exponent may be disentangled from other scaling exponents in finite size scaling experiments, giving an experimental value $\nu_{\rm exp} = 2.3\pm 0.2$. The modular model suggests how these theoretical and experimental results may be reconciled, but in order to determine if these theoretical models really are in the quantum Hall universality class, improved finite size scaling experiments are urgently needed.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the 4-dimensional Galois representations associated with a certain Calabi-Yau threefold are reducible, with 2-dimensional composition factors coming from specific modular forms of weights 2 and 4, both level 14. This was essentially conjectured by Meyer and Verrill. It was revisited in its present form by Candelas, de la Ossa, Elmi and van Straten, whose computations of Euler factors in a whole pencil of Calabi-Yau threefolds highlighted this fibre as one of three overwhelmingly likely to be ``rank-2 attractors''.</description>

      <title>Unitarity violation and restoration in radiative bound-state formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art calculations motivated by dark matter exhibit severe violation of partial-wave unitarity in the non-relativistic regime in radiative bound-state-formation processes. It has been recently shown, in a model-independent fashion, that unitarity is restored by the proper resummation of the inelastic contributions to the self-energy of the incoming state. In this work, we first derive Kramers-like formulae for individual partial waves, demonstrating that existing calculations of bound-state formation severely violate unitarity. We then discuss how unitarity is restored through the resummation of the absorptive contributions to the incoming-state self-energy, generated by bound-state formation processes, taking into account their analytic structure in the complex momentum plane. Our results can be generalized in a variety of theories and employed in phenomenological studies, such as dark-matter freeze-out, indirect detection and self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions produce gravitational waves and primordial black holes. They always occur in field theories where symmetries are radiatively broken and masses are correspondingly generated. These theories predict a period of supercooling: phase transitions become effective at temperatures much smaller than the symmetry-breaking scale. This paper reviews a model-independent approach to study phase transitions in this scenario, which can be adopted if supercooling is strong enough. Perturbative methods can be used to determine the effective action and such model-independent approach allows us to obtain ready-to-use formulas that can be applied to any specific model of this sort.</description>

      <title>A strongly hyperbolic viscous relativistic hydrodynamics theory with first-order charge current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the first order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics model of Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha- Kovtun (BDNK) in order to include the charge number current in full first order expansion with out-of-equilibrium contribution proportional to the evolution equation of the ideal fluid. We obtain a fully second order system of partial differential equation (PDE) that can be casted in a fully conservative way. We analyze the hyperbolicity of this model coupled to Einstein field equations using a newly developed technique that allows for hyperbolicity studies without explicit first order reduction. Furthermore, we identify a frame choice where our formulation is causal, stable and with positive entropy generation for a wide range of equations of state (EoS). Our analysis shows that the inclusion of an out-of-equilibrium correction to the charge current, plays an important role in guaranteeing the strong hyperbolicity and, therefore, the well-posedness of the system. If such correction is not applied, an extra frame restriction must be added to the present in the literature in order to obtain a strongly hyperbolic system.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm Effect for Cooper Pairs in Kerr Spacetime: Gravitomagnetic Phase Shifts from Frame Dragging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains among the most profound challenges in fundamental physics. Here we investigate a novel quantum probe of strong-field gravity: the gravitomagnetic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect for Cooper pairs propagating in Kerr spacetime. The frame-dragging induced by a rotating black hole (BH) generates an effective vector potential through the off-diagonal metric component $g_{t\phi}$, which couples to the macroscopic phase of the superconducting condensate. We derive the gauge-invariant AB phase shift $\Delta\theta = (4\pi m^* Ma/\hbar)(1/r_2 - 1/r_1)$ for an interferometer with arms at radii $r_1$ and $r_2$, where $m^* = 2m_e$ is the Cooper pair mass and $a$ is the BH spin parameter. Remarkably, the predicted phases reach $|\Delta\theta| \sim 10^{24}$ radians for Sgr~A* and $\sim 10^{27}$ radians for M87*, reflecting the enormous gravitomagnetic flux near supermassive BHs. We analyze the dependence on interferometer geometry, demonstrate that tidal disruption of Cooper pairs is negligible at distances $r \gtrsim 10\,r_s$, and establish connections to the geometric Berry phase. Although direct experimental realization remains beyond current technology due to the vast distances involved, our framework provides quantitative predictions linking quantum coherence to spacetime curvature, complementing recent observations of gravitational AB phases in atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Gravity with Non-Extensive Horizon Entropy and Topological Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of gravitational dynamics in the presence of generalized, non-extensive horizon entropies. Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.
  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = \eta (A/4G)^\delta$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(\chi) \propto |\chi|^{1-\delta}$ where $\chi$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-\delta|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology. The framework thus provides a controlled route to confront non-extensive horizon thermodynamics with both theoretical consistency requirements and observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Is a covariant virtual tachyon viable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sidney Coleman has noted that superluminal particles or observers would be able to go back in time and have no definite trajectory according to subluminal observers, while not violating Lorentz invariance [1]. Recently, Dragan and Ekert have significantly developed similar ideas even further, which lead to formulation of ``quantum principle of relativity'' that intimately links the two theories [2]. However, field theory descriptions of an on-shell tachyon, described by scalar field $\phi$ with negative mass squared parameter, lead to violation of basic principles of relativity or quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate whether purely virtual tachyons can be consistent within the fakeon framework-the only known viable formulation of purely virtual particles. We identify two fatal obstructions. First, Lorentz boosts mix creation and annihilation operators, rendering the canonical commutation relations non-invariant despite formal invariance of the vacuum. Second, the real part of the tachyon Feynman propagator and Wheeler propagator have disjoint support, preventing application of both the fakeon prescription and Wheeler-Feynman absorber mechanism. Interactions with stable Standard Model fields further violate Lorentz invariance and the equivalence principle, and we provide quantitative limit on coupling strength of such scenario. Our analysis excludes possibility of formulating covariant quantum field theory of interacting virtual tachyons.</description>

      <title>Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole's Resonant Scattering: Absorption and Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically investigate scalar superradiant scattering in the rotating dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. Starting from the separable Klein-Gordon equation for a massive neutral scalar field, we work in the low-frequency and slow-rotation regime and employ the analytical asymptotic matching (AAM) method to compute the reflection coefficient and the associated superradiant amplification factor. Since an exact global scattering solution is not available in this four-charge geometry, the AAM framework enables a controlled analytic treatment of the near-and far-region dynamics. We provide detailed and systematic derivations of the matching procedure leading to the closed-form amplification formula. The superradiant condition is obtained explicitly and we demonstrate that energy extraction occurs exclusively for co-rotating modes satisfying $\Omega &lt; m \Omega_H$. We show that the presence of electric and magnetic charges suppresses the amplification relative to the Kerr limit, whereas lighter co-rotating scalar fields broaden the superradiant window and enhance the efficiency of rotational energy extraction.</description>

Abstract: The geometry of the Newman-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) vacuum solution is characterized as the unique Petrov Type D vacuum metric such that the two double principal null directions form an integrable distribution. We study expanding and twisting non-vacuum Type D metrics in this geometry, with the additional assumption $\Phi_{01}=\Phi_{12}=0$. We prove that these conditions determine the solutions up to a freedom in $\Phi_{11}\pm 3\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford symmetry protected topological higher-order cluster states in multi-qubit measurement-based quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cluster state is a strongly entangled state, which is a source of measurement-based quantum computation. It is generated by applying controlled-Z (CZ) gates to the state $\left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $. It is protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{ \text{odd}}$ symmetry. By applying general quantum gates to the state $ \left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $, we systematically obtain a general short-range entangled cluster state. If we use a non-Clifford gate such as the controlled phase-shift gate, we obtain a non-Clifford cluster state. Furthermore, if we use the controlled-controlled Z (CCZ) gate instead of the CZ gate, we obtain non-Clifford cluster states with five-body entanglement. We generalize it to the C$^{N}$Z gate, where $(2N+1)$-body entangled states are generated. The $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry is non-Clifford for $N\geq 3$. We demonstrate that there emerge $2^{2N}$ fold degenerate ground states for an open chain, indicating the emergence of $N$ free spins at each edge. They can be used as an $N$-qubit input and an $N$-qubit output in measurement-based quantum computation. We also study the non-invertible symmetry, the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation and the string-order parameter in addition to the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry in these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave radiation from periodic orbits in some standard regular black hole spacetimes is studied, primarily using known methods (numerical and analytic). We demonstrate specific differences with the singular Schwarzschild geometry by analysing orbit characteristics, gravitational wave strain profiles, and the corresponding power spectrum density, for different values of the regularising parameter `$g$'. Further, we assess our results vis-a-vis the LISA sensitivity curves and show how our results may be useful while developing templates for detecting regular black holes as viable alternatives to the singular ones. The appendices to our article contain details on errors in our estimates and provide for the first time, some exact analytical expressions on gravitational wave radiation from different types of periodic orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dissipative Magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation for 2-particle species gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the equations of motion of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. We consider a locally electrically neutral system composed of two particle species with opposite charges, with vanishing dipole moment or spin, so that the fluid has vanishing magnetization and polarization. We find that the dynamics of this fluid changes dramatically in the presence of a magnetic field. The shear stress tensor no longer adheres to a single differential equation; instead, it splits into three non-degenerate components, each evolving according to distinct dynamical equations. Exploring these equations in a Bjorken flow scenario, we find that for large magnetic fields, our theory predicts oscillatory behavior beyond the scope of an Israel-Stewart-like theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a cohomological approach to studying perturbative anomalies in quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ together with the symmetry generator $\hat{S}$ forms a unitary representation of the two-dimensional Abelian Lie algebra $g\cong \mathbb{R}^{2}$ on the Hilbert space $V$. We show that perturbations of such a system are related to the first Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology group $H^{1}_{CE}(\mathbb{R}^{2},\mathfrak{u}(V))$. In turn, the perturbative anomalies of the symmetry $\hat{S}$ are related to the second cohomology group $H^{2}_{CE}(\mathbb{R}^{2},\mathfrak{u}(V))$.</description>

Our study is carried out within lattice simulation in the comoving reference frame of accelerated observer which is parameterized by the Rindler coordinates. We find that finite temperature confinement-deconfinement phase transition turns into spatial crossover in the Rindler spacetime. In other words, spatially separated confinement and deconfinement phases can coexist in the Rindler spacetime within certain intervals of temperature and acceleration. We determine the position of the boundary between the phases as a function of temperature for several accelerations and find that it can be described by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law with rather good accuracy although a minor deviation takes place. Moreover, the critical temperature of the system in the weak acceleration regime is found to remain unchanged as that of the standard homogeneous gluodynamics. Our results imply that the spatial confinement-deconfinement transition might take place in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Scalar Lie point symmetries of the Standard Model with one or two real gauge singlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a classification of all scalar Lie point symmetries of the Standard Model with one or two real gauge-singlet scalars (SM+S and SM+2S). By analyzing the associated field equations, we identify all realizable and inequivalent Lie point symmetry algebras of these models, distinguishing strict variational, variational (including divergence symmetries), and Euler--Lagrange cases. In addition, we devise efficient algorithms that, for any given numerical instance of the models, determine the Lie point symmetry algebra in each of the three categories by a parameter-based decision procedure using affine reparametrizations and simple parameter tests, thereby avoiding explicit symmetry analysis and the need to derive and solve the determining equations. Finally, we prove several relevant general results, including a characterization of the three disjoint types of Lie point symmetry generators -- strict variational, divergence, and non-variational -- for a broad class of Lagrangians with potentials, including the SM+S and SM+2S.</description>

      <title>Extending the Kinetic Mass to Higher Orders in $1/m_Q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the kinetic mass is defined in terms of the pole mass and operators at order $1/m_Q^2$, which are known to N$^3$LO accuracy in $\alpha_s$. At the same time, the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) for inclusive semileptonic decays is known up to and including terms of order $1/m_Q^5$. Therefore, it is desirable to extend the definition of the kinetic mass to higher orders in $1/m_Q$. The original kinetic mass is based on the hadron-mass formula in Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). However, the HQE is formulated in terms of matrix elements defined in full QCD to avoid the appearance of non-local matrix elements. To avoid this, we develop a definition of the kinetic mass rooted in full QCD. Starting from the hadron-mass formula derived from the energy-momentum tensor of full QCD, we define a relation between a general mass and the pole mass. Using a simple cut-off scheme, we compute a generalized kinetic mass at one loop to all powers of $1/m_Q$, which reproduces the well-known results for the kinetic mass up to $1/m_Q^2$. Our approach opens the road to a consistent use of the kinetic mass at higher-orders in the heavy quark expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wavefunction of the universe, as studied in perturbative quantum field theory, is a rational function whose singularities and factorization properties encode a rich underlying combinatorial structure. We define and study a broad generalization of such wavefunctions that can be associated to any lattice. We obtain these wavefunctions as the Laplace transform of a polyhedral fan, the universe fan, whose cones are defined by positivity conditions reflecting a notion of causality in the lattice, and we describe its face lattice. In the matroid case, the universe fan projects to the nested set fan, and the wavefunctions we define recover the matroid amplitudes introduced by Lam as residues. Moreover, in the case relevant for physics, the positivity conditions give a novel way to study the wavefunction, and we show how it is related to the cosmological polytopes of Arkani-Hamed, Benincasa, Postnikov. Finally, we study refinements of the universe fan induced by piecewise linear (tropical) functions. The resulting subdivisions project to refinements of the nested set fan and correspond dually to blow-ups of matroid polytopes, generalizing the cosmohedron polytope.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define a model of non-interacting quantum fields satisfying $(\Delta_g-\lambda^2)\phi=0$ on a Riemannian scattering space $(M,g)$ with two boundary components, i.e. a manifold with two asymptotically conic ends (meaning asymptotic to the "large end" of a cone). Our main result describes a canonical construction of two-point functions satisfying a version of the Hadamard condition.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the Feshbach-Villars (FV) formalism for spin-1/2 particles in curved spacetime. We derive the Hamiltonian form of the Dirac equation in this context and extend the FV transformation accordingly. The generalized Klein-Gordon equation, obtained by squaring the Dirac operator, is reformulated using the FV approach. We present the resulting Hamiltonian in both matrix and Pauli matrix forms, considering gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. The formalism is examined in both (1+2) and (1+3) dimensional spacetimes, with special attention given to the spin-field interaction term. This study provides a framework for studying relativistic quantum mechanics in curved spacetime, offering insights into the interplay between quantum effects, gravity, and electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Effective interaction of Chern-Simons boson with fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a vector extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a Chern-Simons-type interaction. This extension introduces a new massive vector boson (the Chern-Simons (CS) boson) that does not couple directly to SM fermions at tree level. We analyze the effective loop-induced interaction of this new vector boson with SM fermions and study its renormalizability in the $R_\xi$ gauge. We find that, in the effective interaction between the CS boson and same-flavor fermions, the divergent contributions from individual loop diagrams do not cancel when all relevant diagrams are taken into account. In contrast, for interactions involving fermions of different flavors, the corresponding loop-induced contributions are finite and well defined. This indicates that, in the low-energy limit, the theory exhibits nonrenormalizable behavior in the sector describing the loop-induced interaction of the CS boson with same-flavor fermions. The interaction terms between the CS boson and same-flavor fermions, characterized by divergent coefficients, are identified and must be treated within the framework of effective field theory. Finally, we derive the leading-order effective Lagrangian describing the interaction of a GeV-scale CS boson with SM fermions and discuss the number of independent parameters entering this Lagrangian. The leading-order interaction we obtained turns out to be similar to the interaction of a $Z^\prime$ boson with SM fermions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noether: A Covariant Study of Poisson-Lie Symmetries in Low Dimensional Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or "covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

Abstract: Recent work by Headrick, Sasieta and myself provides an extension of the HRT formula for asymptotically flat spacetimes. I use this formula to construct a holographic model of black hole evaporation in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes using Brill-Lindquist (BL) wormholes. The wormhole is interpreted via ER=EPR to represent the entanglement geometry between an evaporating black hole and baths into which the Hawking radiation is collected. Applying HRT, I compute the entanglement entropy by numerically computing the areas of the minimal surfaces, which is shown to obey the Page curve, consistent with information conservation. Numerical analysis is done for both three and four-boundary BL wormholes ($n=3,4$). Index-1 surfaces in the wormhole interior are interpreted as the candidate bulges involved in the python's lunch conjecture (PLC), and their areas are used to compute the restricted complexity $\mathcal{C}$ of decoding the Hawking radiation. The results are compared to the time-dependent predictions of the PLC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study weakly-coupled descriptions/channel decompositions of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ of type $\mathfrak{su}(N)$, from the perspective of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror duals of their circle compactifications. This is a delicate problem when the channel decomposition produces pathological, or bad, 4d configurations that correspond to spheres with non-maximal punctures. The star-shaped quivers, describing the 3d mirrors associated with such bad 4d configurations, are bad 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories. Leveraging recent results regarding 3d bad theories, we identify a new and interesting family of bad theories, which we coin \textit{broken} theories, that naturally arise in this context. Using these broken theories, we develop a systematic and analytic method that determines the generically non-Lagrangian matter sectors and the weakly-coupled gauge groups in such channel decompositions. We understand these weakly-coupled descriptions as emerging dynamically via Higgs mechanisms triggered by operators acquiring vacuum expectation values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Carrollian contractions of $W_N$-algebras from a free-field perspective. Using a contraction of the Miura transformation, we obtain explicit free-field realizations of the resulting Carrollian $W_N$-algebras. At the classical level, they are isomorphic to the Galilean $W_N$-algebras. In the quantum case, we distinguish between two Carrollian constructions: a flipped Carrollian contraction, where the time direction is reversed in one sector, and a symmetric contraction. The flipped construction yields a quantum algebra isomorphic to the Galilean one, whereas the symmetric construction produces a distinct quantum Carrollian $W_N$-algebra whose basic structure constants are identical to those of the classical Carrollian $W_N$-algebra. These algebras provide a natural framework for studying extended symmetries in Carrollian conformal field theories, motivated by recent developments in flat space holography. Our construction provides tools for developing the representation theory of Carrollian (and Galilean) $W_N$-algebras using free-field techniques.</description>

Abstract: We present a generalized unitarity method for theories of point-particle worldlines coupled to gravity, analogous to that of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. This method allows the computation of perturbative observables from basic principles such as locality and unitarity, thus avoiding gauge redundancies and the use of Feynman diagrams. We illustrate the method with a variety of examples, including the gravitational waveform for the scattering of two point masses at next-to-leading order (or ${\cal O}(G^{5/2})$), reproducing known results. Our method further streamlines the calculation of the scattering dynamics of compact binary systems and opens the door to further applications and systematical exploration of structure in this class of observables.</description>

Abstract: We study the nearly critical behaviour of holographic superfluids at finite temperature and chemical potential. Using analytic techniques in the bulk, we derive an effective theory for the long wavelength dynamics of gapless and pseudo-gapped modes, at first subleading order in a derivative expansion and we match the classical limit of our field theory construction in a companion paper. Specifically, we obtain the constitutive relations for the stress tensor and electric current, as well as a time evolution equation for the order parameter at next-to-leading order. In addition, we get explicit formulas for all the transport coefficients in terms of background quantities. We carry out numerical cross-checks with the predictions of our effective theory close to the critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1 supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes, and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric string vacua.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive derivation of the Einstein-Maxwell charges and fluxes in the near-horizon region of a four-dimensional non-extremal black hole, with vanishing cosmological constant. Specifically, we present a detailed derivation of the Noether charges within both the metric and first-order formulations, elucidating the relationship between the Carrollian internal boost charge and the Lorentz boost charge. It is well-established in the literature that Carrollian fluids exhibit an internal local boost symmetry; we demonstrate that this symmetry precisely corresponds to a Lorentz internal transformation. Finally, we prove that the near-horizon Einstein equations can be obtained from the flux-balance law by employing the generalized Barnich-Troessaert bracket.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schur limit, modular differential equations and quantum monodromy traces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore some aspects of the generalized Schur limit, defined in arXiv:2506.13764. Based on several examples, we conjecture that the generalized Schur limit as a function of $\alpha$ solves a modular linear differential equation of fixed order, with coefficients depending on $\alpha$. We also observe in examples that for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,G)$ with $G=A_n,D_n$, the generalized Schur limit for certain negative integer values of $\alpha$, coincides with the trace of higher powers of the quantum monodromy operator. This hints at a more general correspondence between the wall-crossing invariant traces on the Coulomb branch and the generalized Schur limit, which is related to the Higgs branch.</description>

Abstract: Are duality transformations symmetries of string theory? For AdS space-time the answer is no for generic asymptotic values of the moduli, since the duality symmetry is broken explicitly in the dual conformal field theory. In contrast, in string theory in flat space-time, monodromies around codimension two exotic branes show that duality transformations are spontaneously broken discrete gauge symmetries with observable consequences, provided macroscopic loops of these branes are not hidden behind an event horizon. We discuss how this can be achieved and how the situation in flat space-time differs from that in AdS space-time. We also discuss observability of codimension two non-BPS branes, codimension one BPS and non-BPS branes and higher codimension branes of infinite tension.</description>

Abstract: The prototype of a Euclidean wormhole solution of Einstein gravity coupled to matter is the axion wormhole in four spacetime dimensions. In this primarily expository article, we spell out some details about this construction. The axion wormhole has a semiclassical description, found in the original paper [1], in which the matter system is a two-form gauge field B with three-form field strength H=dB. The two-form is dual to a massless scalar, but the wormhole does not have a semiclassical description in terms of the scalar. There is no contradiction here as the duality between the two-form and the scalar is not a simple transformation of classical fields but involves, in Euclidean signature, a Poisson resummation of the sum over fluxes. Because of the need for this Poisson resummation, the scalar field cannot be treated semiclassically in the wormhole throat. Nonetheless, it is straightforward to compute the effective action derived from the wormhole in the scalar (or two-form) language, recovering standard claims.</description>

Abstract: Holographic black holes exhibit a striking relation between thermal boundary one-point functions and bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal-dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length from its boundary insertion point to the horizon. We test the robustness of this relation under perturbations by considering an arbitrary radial deformation of an Euclidean BTZ black hole and working to first order in the perturbation. We find that the relation remains robust: the corrected one-point function at large conformal dimension is still governed by an exponent proportional to the modified boundary-to-horizon geodesic length. The result is established using WKB and saddle-point methods, with the validity of the WKB approximation justified by exact analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the beta functions for the $O(N)^3$-invariant general sextic tensor model up to cubic order in the coupling constant, and at leading order in the $1/N$ expansion. Our method is a direct, explicit one, in the sense that we identify the appropriate Feynman graphs, we compute their amplitudes which then allows us to obtain the $\beta$ functions of the model. We perform these computation considering both a long-range and a short-range propagator, within the dimensional regularization framework. We find three fixed points in the short-range case and a line of fixed points, parameterized by the wheel interaction, in the long-range case. This line of fixed points is identical to the one found in the case of the $U(N)^3$-invariant model. Our result proves that the additional $O(N)^3$-invariant interactions do not modify the long-range fixed point structure of the model.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear realization of conformal so(2,d) symmetry for relativistic systems and the dynamical conformal so(2,1) symmetry of nonrelativistic systems are investigated in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that the massless particle in d-dimensional Minkowski space can be treated as the system confined to the border of the AdS_{d+1} of infinite radius, while various nonrelativistic systems may be canonically related to a relativistic (massless, massive, or tachyon) particle on the AdS_2 X S^{d-1}. The list of nonrelativistic systems "unified" by such a correspondence comprises the conformal mechanics model, the planar charge-vortex and 3-dimensional charge-monopole systems, the particle in a planar gravitational field of a point massive source, and the conformal model associated with the charged particle propagating near the horizon of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.</description>

      <title>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of real-space renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.</description>

Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the Borel half of $Uq (gl(1|1))$ and of the $Uq (gl(1|1))$ when q is a root of unity. We also study the Borel half of Uq (osp(1|2)) for both cases when qis a root of unity and when it is not. We prove the isomorphism between the Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras, which is missing in the literature, and extend the isomorphism to the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the Z2-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory [1, 2], as well as illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the $Uq (gl(1|1))$ Hopf algebra for q being a root of unity. In addition, we generalise an isomorphism between the Drinfeld double and the loop algebra from the Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation to the graded setting.</description>

      <title>Imprint of $\alpha$-Clustering on Ab Initio Correlations in Relativistic Light Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of $\alpha$-cluster structures in relativistic light nuclear collisions. Using a cluster framework, I extract the characteristics of the nucleonic configurations of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne as predicted by various \textit{ab-initio} models, including Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT), Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM). Additionally, I analyze configurations derived from a three-parameter Fermi (3pF) density function. The investigation focuses on the effects of cluster parameters on two-point correlators using a rotor model for symmetric collisions ($^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne) and asymmetric collisions ($^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O and $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne). The cluster parameters are determined by minimizing the \textit{chi-square} statistic to align the nucleon distributions with those predicted by the aforementioned theories. The results reveal that perturbative calculations effectively capture the structural features of these nuclei, while comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations validate these findings. Furthermore, the analysis reveals distinct cluster geometries: VMC suggests tetrahedral shapes, while NLEFT, PGCM, and 3pF indicate irregular triangular pyramids. Notably, NLEFT shows a bowling pin-like $\alpha$ cluster structure for $^{20}$Ne. The study also identifies constraints on cluster parameters in the different oxygen structures, with a gradual increase in $\varepsilon_2\{2\}$ for the states of $\alpha$+$^{12}$C. Accurate modeling of asymmetric collisions necessitates a range of nucleons from heavy spherical nuclei, leading to weighted correlators in perturbative calculations. I demonstrate consistency between perturbative calculations and Monte Carlo models, with analytical calculations providing more insights into asymmetric than symmetric collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.</description>

      <title>Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16298v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Marginal IR running of Gravity as a Natural Explanation for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a simple and universal explanation for large-distance modifications of gravity relevant to dark matter phenomenology. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we model $G(k)$ as a scale-dependent coupling governed by an anomalous dimension $\eta$. We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum-field-theoretic scaling. This provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that galactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as manifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an analytical formula for the quasicoherent states of 3D fuzzy spaces defined by algebras generated by bosonic creation and annihilation operators. This one is expressed in a representation onto the coherent states of the CCR algebra. Such a fuzzy space can be assimilated to a noncommutative D2-brane of the M-theory (but also as a model of a qubit in contact with a bosonic environment). We apply this formula onto a D2-brane wrapped around an axis to obtain the geometry of a noncommutative cylinder. We show that the adiabatic transport of its quasicoherent states exhibits a topological effect similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We study also a D2-brane wrapped and twisted to have the geometry of a noncommutative Mobius strip. Finally we briefly present the other two examples of a noncommutative torus and of a noncommutative Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>Gravity from equilibrium thermodynamics of stretched light cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work digs into the connection between gravity and thermodynamics of stretched light cones (SLC). They are associated with uniformly accelerating observers, who endow the SLC with a physical notion of temperature via the Unruh effect. We compute the expansion, shear, and vorticity of the SLC to fully study its dynamics and account for the possibility of previously predicted non-equilibrium entropy production. For consistency, we prove the equivalence of the two different geometrical methods available for studying the SLCs' properties. Then, we apply the energy balance and use Clausius' relation to relate the geometrical properties of the SLC with energy fluxes crossing its surface, showing that it encodes the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We show here how this analysis can be fully carried in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics due to the vanishing of shear, and how one can identify a work term related to the acceleration of the observer.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-based resummation for spacelike and timelike QCD quantities whose perturbation expansion has general form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of our previous approach of a renormalon-motivated resummation of the QCD observables. Previously it was applied to the spacelike observables whose perturbation expansion was $D(Q^2) = a(Q^2) + O(a^2)$, where $a(Q^2) \equiv \alpha_s(Q^2)/\pi$ is the running QCD coupling. Now we generalise the resummation to spacelike quantities $D(Q^2) = a(Q^2)^{\nu_0} + O(a^{\nu_0+1})$ and timelike quantities $F(\sigma) = a(\sigma)^{\nu_0} + O(a^{\nu_0+1})$, where $\nu_0$ is in general a noninteger number ($0&lt;\nu_0 \leq 1$). We evaluate with this approach a timelike quantity, namely the scheme-invariant factor of the Wilson coefficient of the chromomagnetic operator in the heavy-quark effective Lagrangian, and related quantities.</description>

      <title>Real critical exponents from the $\varepsilon$-expansion in an interacting $U(1)$ model with non-Hermitian $Z_4$ anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics and condensed matter physics non-Hermitian phenomena are often studied under the assumption of an open physical system. However, there are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\mathcal{PT}$ (parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a $U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric $Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Ward-Takahashi identity in the light-front formalism for a bound state of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Ward-Takahashi identity at one-loop in the light-front (LF) formalism for a bound state of fermions. We consider a spinless bound state made up of two fermions in which the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied in the covariant formulation. Considering the same system in the light-front formalism, we investigate the proof of Ward-Takahashi identity by integrating the light-front energy component through the identification of the relevant ranges of the longitudinal LF momentum. We elucidate that the pair production diagram plays a crucial role in establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity. We also point out the necessity of taking into account the corresponding zero modes for truly establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity in the LF formalism.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Probes of Quantum Geometry in Gapless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless quantum matter stems from low-energy descriptions using conformal field theory. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the underlying quantum geometry by considering finite many-body systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that probe the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. The former is less sensitive to decoherence than the latter, so it can provide robust experimental signatures of our predictions. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the emergent effective description. This is supported both by numerical simulations of gapless lattice models, and by exact results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, probing the full dynamical parameter space.</description>

      <title>The Too Visible QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Murayama proposed a GeV-scale axion theory where the up-quark mass term is generated dynamically by the QCD chiral condensate, spontaneously breaking a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. It predicts a too large mass splitting between neutral and charged pions. Trying to solve this problem we explore extensions. Despite some partial improvements, we identify a structural obstruction: the new Peccei-Quinn spurion breaks the accidental isospin symmetry of the chiral Lagrangian, leading to an enhanced higher-order operator. As a consequence, pion scatterings too are distorted. We also examine the limit in which the axion becomes light, finding that it is excluded by fifth-force constraints.</description>

      <title>Black-hole thermodynamics in doubly special relativity: universal $g/f$ Hawking-temperature scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) deforms special-relativistic kinematics by introducing an invariant Planck energy scale $E_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ alongside the speed of light, while preserving the relativity principle. A key issue in curved spacetimes, particularly black-hole thermodynamics, is the operational meaning of the ``energy'' in modified dispersion relations (MDRs).
  We compare two common implementations in a controlled static black-hole spacetime: (i) MDRs in local orthonormal frames on a fixed background geometry, and (ii) the rainbow-metric approach with an energy-dependent family of effective metrics. For static, spherically symmetric horizons and using a consistent finite operational energy scale $E_\star$ for emitted quanta, both yield the same near-horizon temperature rescaling \[ T(E_\star)=T_0\,\frac{g(E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}})}{f(E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}})}, \quad T_0=\kappa_0/(2\pi), \] where $f$ and $g$ are the standard rainbow/MDR functions. This establishes a universality of the tunneling/surface-gravity temperature, with deformation entering solely via the ratio $g/f$.
  We illustrate for Amelino-Camelia MDR and Magueijo-Smolin DSR (where $f=g$, implying $T(E_\star)=T_0$). Extending to a two-parameter generalized DSR (G-DSR) with leading parameters $(\alpha_2, \Delta\alpha)$, we obtain \[ T_{\mathrm{GDRS}}(E_\star) = T_0 \sqrt{\frac{1-2\Delta\alpha\,(E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}})}{1-2\alpha_2\,(E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}})}} \simeq T_0 [1 - (\Delta\alpha - \alpha_2) E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}}]. \]
  We discuss the role of $\Delta\alpha - \alpha_2$ (vanishing correction for the symmetric $\Delta\alpha=\alpha_2$ subfamily) and note that further model dependence arises from phase-space measures, greybody factors, and non-linear composition laws. Corrections are strongly suppressed for macroscopic black holes and become relevant only near the Planck regime.</description>
