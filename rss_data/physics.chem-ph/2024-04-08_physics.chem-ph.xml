      <title>Consistent Second-Order Treatment of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Dynamic Correlation in Quasidegenerate N-Electron Valence Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formulation and implementation of second-order quasidegenerate N-electron valence perturbation theory (QDNEVPT2) that provides a balanced and accurate description of spin-orbit coupling and dynamic correlation effects in multiconfigurational electronic states. In our approach, the energies and wavefunctions of electronic states are computed by treating electron repulsion and spin-orbit coupling operators as equal perturbations to the non-relativistic complete active-space wavefunctions and their contributions are incorporated fully up to the second order. The spin-orbit effects are described using the Breit-Pauli (BP) or exact two-component Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) Hamiltonians within spin-orbit mean-field approximation. The resulting second-order methods (BP2- and DKH2-QDNEVPT2) are capable of treating spin-orbit coupling effects in nearly degenerate electronic states by diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian expanded in a compact non-relativistic basis. For a variety of atoms and small molecules across the entire periodic table, we demonstrate that DKH2-QDNEVPT2 is competitive in accuracy with variational two-component relativistic theories. BP2-QDNEVPT2 shows high accuracy for the second- and third-period elements, but its performance deteriorates for heavier atoms and molecules. We also consider the first-order spin-orbit QDNEVPT2 approximations (BP1- and DKH1-QDNEVPT2), among which DKH1-QDNEVPT2 is reliable but less accurate than DKH2-QDNEVPT2. Both DKH1- and DKH2-QDNEVPT2 hold promise as efficient and accurate electronic structure methods for treating electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Photon Many-body Dispersion: an Exchange-correlation Functional for Strongly Coupled Light-matter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an electron-photon exchange-correlation functional for quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT). The approach, photon MBD (pMBD), is inspired by the many-body dispersion (MBD) method for weak intermolecular interactions, which is generalized to include both electronic and photonic (electromagnetic) degrees of freedom on the same footing. We demonstrate that pMBD accurately captures effects that arise in the context of strong light-matter interactions, such as anisotropic electron-photon interactions, beyond single-photon effects, and cavity modulated van der Waals interactions. Moreover, we show that pMBD is computationally efficient and allows simulations of large complex systems coupled to optical cavities.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation with non-linear couplings: Comparison between Fermi's golden rule and extended dissipaton equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule (FGR) offers an empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of spin-lattice relaxation in magnetic molecules, encompassing mechanisms like direct (one-phonon) and Raman (two-phonon) processes. These principles effectively model experimental longitudinal relaxation rates, denoted as $T_1^{-1}$. However, under scenarios of increased coupling strength and nonlinear spin-lattice interactions, FGR's applicability may diminish. This paper numerically evaluates the exact spin-lattice relaxation rate kernels, employing the extended dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. Our calculations reveal that when quadratic spin-lattice coupling is considered, the rate kernels exhibit a free induction decay-like feature, and the damping rates depend on the interaction strength. We observe that the temperature dependence predicted by FGR significantly deviates from the exact results since FGR ignores the non-Markovian nature of spin-lattice relaxation. Our methods can be readily applied to other systems with nonlinear spin-lattice interactions and provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of $T_1$ in molecular qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational spectrum of the molecular ion HCNH+ is revisited using double-resonance spectroscopy in an ion trap apparatus, with six transitions measured between 74 and 445 GHz. Due to the cryogenic temperature of the trap, the hyperfine splittings caused by the 14N quadrupolar nucleus were resolved for transitions up to J = 4-3, allowing for a refinement of the spectroscopic parameters previously reported, especially the quadrupole coupling constant eQq.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Deep Potential Model for Fast and Accurate Molecular Dynamics; Application to the Hydrated Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular simulations, neural network force fields aim at achieving \emph{ab initio} accuracy with reduced computational cost. This work introduces enhancements to the Deep Potential network architecture, integrating a message-passing framework and a new lightweight implementation with various improvements. Our model achieves accuracy on par with leading machine learning force fields and offers significant speed advantages, making it well-suited for large-scale, accuracy-sensitive systems. We also introduce a new iterative model for Wannier center prediction, allowing us to keep track of electron positions in simulations of general insulating systems. We apply our model to study the solvated electron in bulk water, an ostensibly simple system that is actually quite challenging to represent with neural networks. Our trained model is not only accurate, but can also transfer to larger systems. Our simulation confirms the cavity model, where the electron's localized state is observed to be stable. Through an extensive run, we accurately determine various structural and dynamical properties of the solvated electron.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field on Quantum Phase Space: A Century after Ehrenfest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic transition dynamics lies at the core of many electron/hole transfer, photoactivated, and vacuum field-coupled processes. About a century after Ehrenfest proposed "Phasenraum" and the Ehrenfest theorem, we report a conceptually novel trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics approach, nonadiabatic field (NaF), based on a generalized exact coordinate-momentum phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. It does not employ the conventional Born-Oppenheimer or Ehrenfest trajectory in the nonadiabatic coupling region. Instead, in NaF the equations of motion of the independent trajectory involve a nonadiabatic nuclear force term in addition to an adiabatic nuclear force term of a single electronic state. A few benchmark tests for gas phase and condensed phase systems indicate that NaF offers a practical tool to capture the correct correlation of electronic and nuclear dynamics for processes where the states remain coupled all the time as well as for the asymptotic region where the coupling of electronic states vanishes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use constraint phase space [developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501], non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit empirically proposed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>Axion-mediated electron-nucleus and electron-electron interactions in barium monofluoride molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects induced by the time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and spatial parity ($\mathcal{P}$) violating electron-nucleus and electron-electron interactions mediated by the axion-like particles (ALPs) in the BaF molecule were estimated. Molecular parameters characterizing these interactions were calculated across a wide range of ALP masses. In case of the electron-nuclear interaction, the effect of the extended nucleus was studied and shown to be significant for heavy ALPs. Based on the calculated molecular parameters, we obtained a link between the $\mathcal{T}$,$\mathcal{P}$-violating energy shift which can be measured in the ongoing experiment designed to search for the electron electric dipole moment using the BaF molecule [A. Boeschoten et al., arXiv:2303.06402 (2023)] and the products of coupling constants of the ALP-electron or ALP-electron and ALP-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>A Fast Analytical Model for Predicting Battery Performance Under Mixed Kinetic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of battery rate performance traditionally relies on computation-intensive numerical simulations. While simplified analytical models have been developed to accelerate the calculation, they usually assume battery performance to be controlled by a single rate-limiting process, such as solid diffusion or electrolyte transport. Here, we propose an improved analytical model that could be applied to battery discharging under mixed control of mass transport in both solid and electrolyte phases. Compared to previous single-particle models extended to incorporate the electrolyte kinetics, our model is able to predict the effect of salt depletion on diminishing the discharge capacity, a phenomenon that becomes important in thick electrodes and/or at high rates. The model demonstrates good agreement with the full-order simulation over a wide range of cell parameters and offers a speedup of over 600 times at the same time. Furthermore, it could be combined with gradient-based optimization algorithms to very efficiently search for the optimal battery cell configurations while numerical simulation fails at the task due to its inability to accurately evaluate the derivatives of the objective function. The high efficiency and the analytical nature of the model render it a powerful tool for battery cell design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Selecting active matter according to motility in an acoustofluidic setup: Self-propelled particles and sperm cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active systems -- including sperm cells, living organisms like bacteria, fish, birds, or active soft matter systems like synthetic ''microswimmers'' -- are characterized by motility, i.e., the ability to propel using their own ''engine''. Motility is the key feature that distinguishes active systems from passive or externally driven systems. In a large ensemble, motility of individual species can vary in a wide range. Selecting active species according to their motility represents an exciting and challenging problem. We propose a new method for selecting active species based on their motility using an acoustofluidic setup where highly motile species escape from the acoustic trap. This is demonstrated in simulations and in experiments with self-propelled Janus particles and human sperm. The immediate application of this method is selecting highly motile sperm for medically assisted reproduction (MAR). Due to the tunable acoustic trap, the proposed method is more flexible than the existing passive microfluidic methods. The proposed selection method based on motility can also be applied to other active systems that require selecting highly motile species or removing immotile species.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field with Triangle Window Functions on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and has been applied to various fields of physical science. However, the performance and transferability of MLIPs are limited by insufficient labeled training data, which require expensive ab initio calculations to obtain the labels, especially for complex molecular systems. To address this challenge, we design a novel geometric structure learning paradigm that consists of two stages. We first generate a large quantity of 3D configurations of target molecular system with classical molecular dynamics simulations. Then, we propose geometry-enhanced self-supervised learning consisting of masking, denoising, and contrastive learning to better capture the topology and 3D geometric information from the unlabeled 3D configurations. We evaluate our method on various benchmarks ranging from small molecule datasets to complex periodic molecular systems with more types of elements. The experimental results show that the proposed pre-training method can greatly enhance the accuracy of MLIPs with few extra computational costs and works well with different invariant or equivariant graph neural network architectures. Our method improves the generalization capability of MLIPs and helps to realize accurate MD simulations for complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Qubit Count Reduction by Orthogonally-Constrained Orbital Optimization for Variational Quantum Excited States Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09418v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a state-averaged orbital optimization scheme for improving the accuracy of excited states of the electronic structure Hamiltonian for use on near-term quantum computers. Instead of parameterizing the orbital rotation operator in the conventional fashion as an exponential of an anti-hermitian matrix, we parameterize the orbital rotation as a general partial unitary matrix. Whereas conventional orbital optimization methods minimize the state-averaged energy using successive Newton steps of the second-order Taylor expansion of the energy, the method presented here optimizes the state-averaged energy using an orthogonally-constrained gradient projection method which does not require any expansion approximations. Through extensive benchmarking of the method on various small molecular systems, we find that the method is capable of producing more accurate results than fixed basis FCI while simultaneously using fewer qubits. In particular, we show that for $\mathrm{H_2}$, the method is capable of matching the accuracy of FCI in the cc-pVTZ basis (56 qubits) while only using 14 qubits.</description>

      <title>Comparing self-consistent GW and vertex corrected G0W0 (G0W0{\Gamma}) accuracy for molecular ionization potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test the performance of self-consistent GW and several representative implementations of vertex corrected G0W0 (G0W0{\Gamma}). These approaches are tested on benchmark data sets covering full valence spectra (first ionization potentials and some inner valence shell excitations). For small molecules, when comparing against state of the art wave function techniques, our results show that performing full self-consistency in the GW scheme either systematically outperforms vertex corrected G0W0 or gives results of at least the same quality. Moreover, the G0W0{\Gamma} results in additional computational cost when compared to G0W0 or self-consistent GW and the G0W0{\Gamma} dependency on the starting mean-filed solution is frequently larger than the magnitude of the vertex correction. Consequently, for molecular systems self-consistent GW performed on imaginary axis and then followed by modern analytical continuation techniques offers a more reliable approach to make predictions of IP spectra.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) are widely applied as an efficient alternative way to represent potential energy surfaces (PES) in many chemical simulations. The MLPs are often evaluated with the root-mean-square errors on the test set drawn from the same distribution as the training data. Here, we systematically investigate the relationship between such test errors and the simulation accuracy with MLPs on an example of a full-dimensional, global PES for the glycine amino acid. Our results show that the errors in the test set do not unambiguously reflect the MLP performance in different simulation tasks such as relative conformer energies, barriers, vibrational levels, and zero-point vibrational energies. We also offer an easily accessible solution for improving the MLP quality in a simulation-oriented manner, yielding the most precise relative conformer energies and barriers. This solution also passed the stringent test by the diffusion Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>

Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: I. Calculation of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence intensities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>On data and dimension in chemistry I -- irreversibility, concealment and emergent conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical systems are interpreted through the species they contain and the reactions they may undergo, i.e., their chemical reaction network (CRN). In spite of their central importance to chemistry, the structure of CRNs continues to be challenging to deduce from data. Although there exist structural laws relating species, reactions, conserved quantities and cycles, there has been limited attention to their measurable consequences. One such is the dimension of the chemical data: the number of independent reactions, i.e. the number of measured variables minus the number of constraints. In this paper we attempt to relate the experimentally observed dimension to the structure of the CRN. In particular, we investigate the effects of species that are concealed and reactions that are irreversible. For instance, irreversible reactions can have proportional rates. The resulting reduction in degrees of freedom can be captured by the co-production law, relating co-production relations to emergent non-integer conservation laws and broken cycles. This law resolves a recent conundrum posed by a machine-discovered candidate for a non-integer conservation law. We also obtain laws that allow us to relate data dimension to network structure in cases where some species cannot be discerned or distinguished by a given analytical technique, allowing to better narrow down what CRNs can underly experimental data.</description>

      <title>Coupled Cluster Degree of the Grassmannian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the number of complex solutions to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem on the Grassmannian in its Pl\"ucker embedding. This is motivated by quantum chemistry, where it represents the truncation to single electrons in coupled cluster theory. We prove the formula for the Grassmannian of lines which was conjectured in earlier work with Fabian Faulstich. This rests on the geometry of the graph of a birational parametrization of the Grassmannian. We present a squarefree Gr\"obner basis for this graph, and we develop connections to toric degenerations from representation theory.</description>

      <title>Chemotactic particles as strong electrolytes: Debye-H\"uckel approximation and effective mobility law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a binary mixture of chemically active particles, that produce or consume solute molecules, and that interact with each other through the long-range concentrations fields they generate. We analytically calculate the effective phoretic mobility of these particles when the mixture is submitted to a constant, external concentration gradient, at leading order in the overall concentration. Relying on a analogy with the modeling of strong electrolytes, we show that the effective phoretic mobility decays with the square-root of the concentration: our result is therefore a nonequilibrium counterpart to the celebrated Kohlrausch and Debye-H\"uckel-Onsager conductivity laws for electrolytes, which are extended here to particles with long-range nonreciprocal interactions. The effective mobility law we derive reveals the existence of a regime of maximal mobility, and could find applications in the description of nanoscale transport phenomena in living cells.</description>
