      <title>BASIR: Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking -- A Dataset for Sector Identification and Performance Prediction Using Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Government fiscal policies, particularly annual union budgets, exert significant influence on financial markets. However, real-time analysis of budgetary impacts on sector-specific equity performance remains methodologically challenging and largely unexplored. This study proposes a framework to systematically identify and rank sectors poised to benefit from India's Union Budget announcements. The framework addresses two core tasks: (1) multi-label classification of excerpts from budget transcripts into 81 predefined economic sectors, and (2) performance ranking of these sectors. Leveraging a comprehensive corpus of Indian Union Budget transcripts from 1947 to 2025, we introduce BASIR (Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking), an annotated dataset mapping excerpts from budgetary transcripts to sectoral impacts. Our architecture incorporates fine-tuned embeddings for sector identification, coupled with language models that rank sectors based on their predicted performances. Our results demonstrate 0.605 F1-score in sector classification, and 0.997 NDCG score in predicting ranks of sectors based on post-budget performances. The methodology enables investors and policymakers to quantify fiscal policy impacts through structured, data-driven insights, addressing critical gaps in manual analysis. The annotated dataset has been released under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license to advance computational economics research.</description>

      <title>Target search optimization by threshold resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic searchers as a key example uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models Meet Financial Data Modalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading relies on extracting meaningful signals from diverse financial data sources, including candlestick charts, order statistics on put and canceled orders, traded volume data, limit order books, and news flow. While deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in processing unstructured data and has significantly advanced natural language processing, its application to structured financial data remains an ongoing challenge. This study investigates the integration of deep learning models with financial data modalities, aiming to enhance predictive performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization. We present a novel approach to incorporating limit order book analysis into algorithmic trading by developing embedding techniques and treating sequential limit order book snapshots as distinct input channels in an image-based representation. Our methodology for processing limit order book data achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-frequency trading algorithms, underscoring the effectiveness of deep learning in financial applications.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Adjustment in Multivariate Volatility Modeling: Evidence from Portfolios of Cryptocurrencies and US Stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a liquidity-sensitive multivariate volatility framework to improve the estimation of time-varying covariance structures under market frictions. We introduce two novel portfolio-level liquidity measures, liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion, which capture magnitude and volatility of liquidity fluctuation, respectively, and construct liquidity-adjusted return and volatility that reflect real-time liquidity variability. These liquidity-adjusted inputs are integrated into a VECM-DCC/ADCC-Bayesian model, allowing for conditional and posterior covariance estimation under liquidity stress. Applying this framework to portfolios of cryptocurrencies and US stocks, we find that traditional models misrepresent volatility and co-movement, while liquidity-adjusted models yield more stable and interpretable risk structures, particularly for portfolios of cryptocurrencies. The findings support the use of liquidity-adjusted multivariate models as statistically grounded tools for assessing the propagation of portfolio risk under market frictions, with implications for asset pricing, market microstructure design, and portfolio management.</description>
