      <title>Soliton-to-droplet crossover in a dipolar Bose gas in one and two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a system of dipolar atoms confined in geometries of quasi-low-dimensionality. Due to the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipolar interactions, the system supports both stable solitons and quantum droplets. In quasi-one-dimensional geometries, the transition between these states is known to manifest either as a first-order phase transition, associated with bistability, or as a smooth crossover. We investigate this transition by calculating the structure factor and showing that the response of the breathing mode provides an experimentally accessible probe. In addition, we identify regions of both bistability and smooth crossover in quasi-two-dimensional geometries. Finally, we connect our findings to previous experimental results and delineate the conditions under which two-dimensional dipolar bright solitons can be realized.</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Limit Cycle: Universal Form for General Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Efimov effect, a remarkable realization of discrete scale invariance, emerges in the three-body problem with short-range interactions and is understood as a renormalization group (RG) limit cycle within Short-Range Effective Field Theory (SREFT). While the analytic form of the three-body renormalization relation has been established for a sharp cutoff regulator, its universality for other regulators remains underexplored. In this work, we derive the universal functional form of the three-body renormalization relation for general separable regulators through a detailed analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian and Faddeev equations. We find that the relation follows from a real M\"{o}bius transformation characterized by three parameters. This universality is verified numerically for various regulators. Although the functional form remains the same, the parameters characterizing the limit cycle exhibit regulator dependence. These findings broaden the class of RG limit cycles in SREFT and offer a more complete understanding of three-body renormalization.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7$ up to $L=20)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupled spin-boson model : A variational analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.</description>
