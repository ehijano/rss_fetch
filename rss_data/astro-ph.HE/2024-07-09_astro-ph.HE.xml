      <title>Could a slow stable hybrid star explain the central compact object in HESS~J1731-347?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an alternative explanation for the low-mass ultra-compact star in the supernova remnant HESS~J1731-347 using a model-agnostic approach to construct hybrid equations of state. The hadronic part of the hybrid equation of state is constructed using a generalized piecewise polytropic scheme, while the quark phase is described by the generic constant speed of sound model. We assume an abrupt first-order hadron-quark phase transition with a slow conversion speed between phases. Our equations of state align with modern Chiral Effective Field Theory calculations near nuclear saturation density and are consistent with perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics calculations at high densities. Using this theoretical framework, we derive a wide range of hybrid equations of state capable of explaining the light compact object in HESS~J1731-347 in a model-independent manner, without fine-tuning. These equations of state are also consistent with modern astronomical constraints from high-mass pulsar timing, NICER observations, and multimessenger astronomy involving gravitational waves. Our results support the hypothesis that the compact object in HESS~J1731-347 could plausibly be a slow stable hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Investigating the off-axis GRB afterglow scenario for extragalactic fast X-ray transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are short-duration ($\sim$ ks) X-ray flashes of unknown origin, potentially arising from binary neutron star mergers. We investigate the possible link between FXTs and the afterglows of off-axis merger-induced gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). By modelling the broadband afterglows of 13 GRBs, we make predictions for their X-ray light curve behaviour had they been observed off-axis, considering both a uniform jet with core angle $\theta_{C}$ and a Gaussian-structured jet with truncation angle $\theta_{W} = 2\theta_{C}$. We compare their peak X-ray luminosity, duration, and temporal indices with those of the currently known extragalactic FXTs. Our analysis reveals that a slightly off-axis observing angle of $\theta_{\text{obs}}\approx (2.2-3)\theta_{C}$ and a structured jet are required to explain the shallow temporal indices of the FXT light curves. In the case of a structured jet, the durations of the FXTs are consistent with those of the off-axis afterglows for the same range of observing angles, $\theta_{\text{obs}}\approx (2.2-3)\theta_{C}$. While the off-axis peak X-ray luminosities are consistent only for $\theta_{\text{obs}} = 2.2\theta_{C}$, focussing on individual events reveals that the match of all three properties of the FXTs at the same viewing angle is possible in the range $\theta_{\text{obs}} \sim (2.2-2.6)\theta_{C}$. Despite the small sample of GRBs analysed, these results show that there is a region of the parameter space - although quite limited - where the observational properties of off-axis GRB afterglows can be consistent with those of the newly discovered FXTs. Future observations of FXTs discovered by the recently launched Einstein Probe mission and GRB population studies combined with more complex afterglow models will shed light on this possible GRB-FXT connection, and eventually unveil the progenitors of some FXTs.</description>

      <title>Rotational Properties of Inverted Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rotational properties of inverted hybrid stars (also termed cross stars), which have been recently proposed as a possible new class of compact stars characterized by an outer layer of quark matter and a core of hadrons, in an inverted structure compared to traditional hybrid stars. We analyze distinct models representing varying depths of quark-hadron phase transitions. Our findings reveal that, while cross stars rotating at their Kepler frequencies typically exhibit a significantly higher mass and larger circumferential radius as anticipated, interestingly, there is a significant increase in potential twin configurations in the case of rapid rotations. We further study sequences of constant baryonic mass, representing potential paths of rotational evolution. Our results indicate that not all stars in these sequences are viable due to the onset of phase transitions during spin-down, leading to possible mini-collapses. We also investigate the phenomenon of ``back-bending" during spin-down sequences, which is manifested in a rather different shape for cross stars due to their inverted structure and the large density discontinuity caused by the strong phase transition, in contrast to traditional hybrid stars. Our research enriches existing studies by introducing the significant aspect of rotation, unveiling intr</description>

      <title>Investigating the interplay between AGN coronal properties and hard X-ray variability with NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely variable in the X-ray band down to very short time scales. However, the driver of the X-ray variability is still poorly understood. Previous results suggest that the hot corona, which is responsible for the primary Comptonized emission observed in AGN, should have an important role in driving the X-ray variability. In this work, we investigate the connection between the X-ray amplitude variability and the coronal physical parameters, namely the temperature ($kT$) and optical depth ($\tau$). We present the spectral and timing analysis of 46 NuSTAR observations corresponding to a sample of 20 AGN. For each source we derive the coronal temperature and optical depth through X-ray spectroscopy, and we compute the normalized excess variance for different energy bands at a time scale of $10$ ks. We find a strong inverse correlation between $kT$ and $\tau$, with correlation coefficient $r&lt;-0.9$ and negligible null probability. No clear dependence between the temperature and physical properties such as the black hole mass and the Eddington ratio is found. We also find that the observed X-ray variability does not correlate with either the coronal temperature or optical depth under the thermal equilibrium assumption, while it is anti-correlated with the black hole mass. These results can be interpreted in a scenario where one possibility is that the observed X-ray variability could be mainly driven by variations in coronal physical properties on a time scale of less than $10$ ks, whereas we assume thermal equilibrium at such time scales in this paper, given the capability of the currently available hard X-ray telescopes. However, it is also possible that the X-ray variability is mostly driven by the absolute size of the corona, which depends on the supermassive black hole mass, rather than by its physical properties.</description>

      <title>A NICER View of the Nearest and Brightest Millisecond Pulsar: PSR J0437$\unicode{x2013}$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Bayesian inference of the mass, radius and hot X-ray emitting region properties - using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) - for the brightest rotation-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar PSR J0437$\unicode{x2013}$4715. Our modeling is conditional on informative tight priors on mass, distance and binary inclination obtained from radio pulsar timing using the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) (Reardon et al. 2024), and we use NICER background models to constrain the non-source background, cross-checking with data from XMM-Newton. We assume two distinct hot emitting regions, and various parameterized hot region geometries that are defined in terms of overlapping circles; while simplified, these capture many of the possibilities suggested by detailed modeling of return current heating. For the preferred model identified by our analysis we infer a mass of $M = 1.418 \pm 0.037$ M$_\odot$ (largely informed by the PPTA mass prior) and an equatorial radius of $R = 11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles. This radius favors softer dense matter equations of state and is highly consistent with constraints derived from gravitational wave measurements of neutron star binary mergers. The hot regions are inferred to be non-antipodal, and hence inconsistent with a pure centered dipole magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dense matter equation of state with new NICER mass-radius measurements and new chiral effective field theory inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse profile modeling of X-ray data from NICER is now enabling precision inference of neutron star mass and radius. Combined with nuclear physics constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), and masses and tidal deformabilities inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary neutron star mergers, this has lead to a steady improvement in our understanding of the dense matter equation of state (EOS). Here we consider the impact of several new results: the radius measurement for the 1.42$\,M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0437$-$4715 presented by Choudhury et al. (2024), updates to the masses and radii of PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, and new $\chi$EFT results for neutron star matter up to 1.5 times nuclear saturation density. Using two different high-density EOS extensions -- a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model and a model based on the speed of sound in a neutron star (CS) -- we find the radius of a 1.4$\,M_\odot$ (2.0$\,M_\odot$) neutron star to be constrained to the 95\% credible ranges $12.28^{+0.50}_{-0.76}\,$km ($12.33^{+0.70}_{-1.34}\,$km) for the PP model and $12.01^{+0.56}_{-0.75}\,$km ($11.55^{+0.94}_{-1.09}\,$km) for the CS model. The maximum neutron star mass is predicted to be $2.15^{+0.14}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ and $2.08^{+0.28}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ for the PP and CS model, respectively. We explore the sensitivity of our results to different orders and different densities up to which $\chi$EFT is used, and show how the astrophysical observations provide constraints for the pressure at intermediate densities. Moreover, we investigate the difference $R_{2.0} - R_{1.4}$ of the radius of 2$\,M_\odot$ and 1.4$\,M_\odot$ neutron stars within our EOS inference.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: The spectral diversity of Type Ia supernovae in a volume-limited sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 3000 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are presented in the Zwicky Transient Facility SN Ia Data Release 2 (ZTF DR2). In this paper, we detail the spectral properties of 482 SNe Ia near maximum light, up to a redshift limit of $z$ $\leq$ 0.06. We measure the velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths (pEW) of key spectral features (Si II $\lambda$5972 and Si II $\lambda$6355) and investigate the relation between the properties of the spectral features and the photometric properties from the SALT2 light-curve parameters as a function of spectroscopic sub-class. We discuss the non-negligible impact of host galaxy contamination on SN Ia spectral classifications, as well as investigate the accuracy of spectral template matching of the ZTF DR2 sample. We define a new subclass of underluminous SNe Ia (`04gs-like') that lie spectroscopically between normal SNe Ia and transitional 86G-like SNe Ia (stronger Si II $\lambda$5972 than normal SNe Ia but significantly weaker Ti II features than `86G-like' SNe). We model these `04gs-like' SN Ia spectra using the radiative-transfer spectral synthesis code tardis and show that cooler temperatures alone are unable to explain their spectra; some changes in elemental abundances are also required. However, the broad continuity in spectral properties seen from bright (`91T-like') to faint normal SN Ia, including the transitional and 91bg-like SNe Ia, suggests that variations within a single explosion model may be able to explain their behaviour.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT XV: A comparison of the radio emission properties of slow and millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use data from the MeerTime project on the MeerKAT telescope to ask whether the radio emission properties of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and slowly rotating, younger pulsars (SPs) are similar or different. We show that the flux density spectra of both populations are similarly steep, and the widths of MSP pulsar profiles obey the same dependence on the rotational period as slow pulsars. We also show that the polarization of MSPs has similar properties to slow pulsars. The commonly used pseudo-luminosity of pulsars, defined as the product of the flux density and the distance squared, is not appropriate for drawing conclusions about the relative intrinsic radio luminosity of SPs and MSPs. We show that it is possible to scale the pseudo-luminosity to account for the pulse duty cycle and the solid angle of the radio beam, in such a way that MSPs and SPs do not show clear differences in intrinsic luminosity. The data, therefore, support common emission physics between the two populations in spite of orders of magnitude difference in their period derivatives and inferred, surface, dipole magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>All known Type Ia supernovae models fail to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity-width correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely believed to arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs). However, ongoing debate surrounds their progenitor systems and the mechanisms triggering these explosions. Recently, Sharon \&amp; Kushnir showed that existing models do not reproduce the observed positive correlation between the $\gamma$-ray escape time, $t_0$, and the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$. Their analysis, while avoiding complex radiation transfer (RT) calculations, did not account for the viewing-angle dependence of the derived $t_0$ and $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ in multi-dimensional (multi-D) models during pre-nebular phases, where most observations performed. Here, we aim to identify an observational width-luminosity relation, similar to the $t_0$-$M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ relation to constrain multi-D models during pre-nebular phases while minimizing RT calculation uncertainties. We show that the bolometric luminosity at $t\le30$ days since explosion can be accurately computed without non-thermal ionization considerations, which are computationally expensive and uncertain. We find that the ratio of the bolometric luminosity at 30 days since explosion to the peak luminosity, $L_{30}/Lp$, correlates strongly with $t_0$. Using a sample of well-observed SNe Ia, we show that this parameter tightly correlates with the peak luminosity, $L_p$. We compare the observed $L_{30}/Lp$-$L_p$ distribution with models from the literature, including non-spherical models consisting of head-on WD collisions and off-centered ignitions of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs. We find that all known SNe Ia models fail to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity-width correlation.</description>

      <title>The flux of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays along the supergalactic plane measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are known to be mainly of extragalactic origin, and their propagation is limited by energy losses, so their arrival directions are expected to correlate with the large-scale structure of the local Universe. In this work, we investigate the possible presence of intermediate-scale excesses in the flux of the most energetic cosmic rays from the direction of the supergalactic plane region using events with energies above 20 EeV recorded with the surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory up to 31 December 2022, with a total exposure of 135,000 km^2 sr yr. The strongest indication for an excess that we find, with a post-trial significance of 3.1{\sigma}, is in the Centaurus region, as in our previous reports, and it extends down to lower energies than previously studied. We do not find any strong hints of excesses from any other region of the supergalactic plane at the same angular scale. In particular, our results do not confirm the reports by the Telescope Array collaboration of excesses from two regions in the Northern Hemisphere at the edge of the field of view of the Pierre Auger Observatory. With a comparable exposure, our results in those regions are in good agreement with the expectations from an isotropic distribution.</description>

      <title>Combined Fit of Spectrum and Composition for FR0 Radio Galaxy Emitted Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Resulting Secondary Photons and Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study comprehensively investigates the gamma-ray dim population of Fanaroff-Riley Type 0 (FR0) radio galaxies as potentially significant sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E $&gt;$ 10$^{18}$ eV) detected on Earth. While individual FR0 luminosities are relatively low compared to the more powerful Fanaroff-Riley Type 1 and Type 2 galaxies, FR0s are substantially more prevalent in the local universe, outnumbering the more energetic galaxies by a factor of $\sim$5 within a redshift of z $\leq$ 0.05.
  Employing CRPropa3 simulations, we estimate the mass composition and energy spectra of UHECRs originating from FR0 galaxies for energies above 10$^{18.6}$ eV. This estimation fits data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) using three extensive air shower models; both constant and energy-dependent observed elemental fractions are considered. The simulation integrates an isotropic distribution of FR0 galaxies, extrapolated from observed characteristics, with UHECR propagation in the intergalactic medium, incorporating various plausible configurations of extragalactic magnetic fields, both random and structured. We then compare the resulting emission spectral indices, rigidity cutoffs, and elemental fractions with recent Auger results. In total, 25 combined energy spectrum and mass composition fits are considered.
  Beyond the cosmic ray fluxes emitted by FR0 galaxies, this study predicts the secondary photon and neutrino fluxes from UHECR interactions with intergalactic cosmic photon backgrounds. The multi-messenger approach, encompassing observational data and theoretical models, helps elucidate the contribution of low luminosity FR0 radio galaxies to the total cosmic ray energy density.</description>

      <title>The First VHE Activity of OJ 287 and the Extragalactic Background Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BL Lacertae (BL Lac) object OJ 287 underwent an intense X-ray activity phase, exhibiting its brightest recorded X-ray flare in 2016-2017, characterized by much softer X-ray spectra and, concurrently, its first-ever recorded very-high-energy (VHE) emission (100--560 GeV), reported by the VERITAS observatory. Broadband spectral energy distribution reveals a new jet emission component similar to high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects, thereby implying the soft X-ray spectrum for the synchrotron emission. Using the advantage of simultaneous X-ray and VHE spectral information, as well as the source being a low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object, we systematically explored the extragalactic background light (EBL) spectrum by demanding that the VHE spectrum cannot be harder than the X-ray spectrum. We used three different phenomenological forms of the EBL spectral shape (power-law, parabola, and polynomial) motivated by current constraints on the EBL with the Bayesian Monte Carlo approach to infer the credible EBL range. Our study favors an almost flat power-law spectral shape and is consistent with previous studies. The other spectral forms capable of capturing curvature though result in a better statistics value; the improvement is statistically insignificant given the additional parameters.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic effects and the NIR variability of Sgr A* II: A systematic approach to temporal asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study, based on the third-moment structure function, of Sgr A*'s variability finds an exponential rise time $\tau_{1,\rm{obs}}=14.8^{+0.4}_{-1.5}~\mathrm{minutes}$ and decay time $\tau_{2,\rm{obs}}=13.1^{+1.3}_{-1.4}~\mathrm{minutes}$. This symmetry of the flux-density variability is consistent with earlier work, and we interpret it as caused by the dominance of Doppler boosting, as opposed to gravitational lensing, in Sgr~A*'s light curve. A relativistic, semi-physical model of Sgr~A* confirms an inclination angle $i&lt;45$ degrees. The model also shows that the emission of the intrinsic radiative process can have some asymmetry even though the observed emission does not. The third-moment structure function, which is a measure of the skewness of the light-curve increments, may be a useful summary statistic in other contexts of astronomy because it senses only temporal asymmetry, i.e., it averages to zero for any temporally symmetric signal.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis Of Fractional Relativistic Polytropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In astrophysics, the gravitational stability of a self-gravitating polytropic fluid sphere is an intriguing subject, especially when trying to comprehend the genesis and development of celestial bodies like planets and stars. This stability is the sphere's capacity to stay in balance in the face of disruptions. We utilize fractional calculus to explore self-gravitating, hydrostatic spheres governed by a polytropic equation of state \P=K\rho^{1+1/n}. We focus on structures with polytropic indices ranging from 1 to 3 and consider relativistic and fractional parameters, denoted by \sigma and \alpha, respectively. The stability of these relativistic polytropes is evaluated using the critical point method, which is associated with the energetic principles developed in 1964 by Tooper. This approach enables us to pinpoint the critical mass and radius at which where polytropic spheres shift from stable to unstable states. The results highlight the critical relativistic parameter where the polytrope's mass peaks, signaling the onset of radial instability. For polytropic indices of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 with a fractional parameter \alpha, we observe stable relativistic polytropes for \sigma values below the critical thresholds of \sigma= 0.42, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.0, respectively. Conversely, instability emerges as \sigma surpasses these critical values. Our comprehensive calculations reveal that the critical relativistic value (\sigma_{CR}) for the onset of instability tends to increase as the fractional parameter {\alpha} decreases.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Interactions of Supernova Neutrinos and Mass Ordering Ambiguity at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) can notably modify the pattern of resonant flavor conversion of neutrinos within supernovae and significantly impact the neutronization burst signal in forthcoming experiments such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The presence of NSI can invert the energy levels of neutrino matter eigenstates and even induce a new resonance in the inner parts close to the proto-neutron star. We demonstrate how DUNE can use these new configurations of energy levels to have sensitivity to NSIs down to $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We also elucidate how the effect may result in a puzzling confusion of normal and inverted mass orderings by highlighting the emergence or vanishing of the neutronization peak, which distinguishes between the two mass orderings. Potential implications are analyzed thoroughly.</description>

      <title>Indirect Searches for Ultraheavy Dark Matter in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may exist today in the form of ultraheavy composite bound states. Collisions between such dark matter states can release intense bursts of radiation that includes gamma-rays among the final products. Thus, indirect-detection signals of dark matter may include unconventional gamma-ray bursts. Such bursts may have been missed not necessarily because of their low arriving gamma-ray fluxes, but rather their briefness and rareness. We point out that intense bursts whose non-detection thus far are due to the latter can be detected in the near future with existing and planned facilities. In particular, we propose that, with slight experimental adjustments and suitable data analyses, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared and Optical Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) are promising tools for detecting such rare, brief, but intense bursts. We also show that if we assume these bursts originate from collisions of dark matter states, IACTs and PANOSETI can probe a large dark matter parameter space beyond existing limits. Additionally, we present a concrete model of dark matter that produces bursts potentially detectable in these instruments.</description>

      <title>Spectral Variance in a Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background From a Binary Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A population of compact object binaries emitting gravitational waves that are not individually resolvable will form a stochastic gravitational wave signal. While the expected spectrum over population realizations is well known from Phinney (2001), its higher order moments have not been fully studied before or computed in the case of arbitrary binary evolution. We calculate analytic scaling relationships as a function of gravitational-wave frequency for the statistical variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal over population realizations. If the time derivative of the binary orbital frequency can be expressed as a power-law in frequency, we find that these moment quantities also take the form of power-law relationships. We also develop a numerical population synthesis framework against which we compare our analytic results, finding excellent agreement. These new scaling relationships provide physical context to understanding spectral fluctuations in a gravitational-wave background signal and may provide additional information that can aid in explaining the origin of the nanohertz-frequency signal observed by pulsar timing array campaigns.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>In-field phasing at the upgraded GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In time-domain radio astronomy with arrays, voltages from individual antennas are added together with proper delay and fringe correction to form the beam in real-time. In order to achieve the correct phased addition of antenna voltages one has to also correct for the ionospheric and instrumental gains. Conventionally this is done using observations of a calibrator source located near to the target field. This scheme is sub-optimal since it does not correct for the variation of the gains with time and position in the sky. Further, since the ionospheric phase variation is typically most rapid at the longest baselines, the most distant antennas are often excluded while forming the beam. We present here a different methodology ("in-field phasing"), in which the gains are obtained in real-time using a model of the intensity distribution in the target field, which overcomes all of these drawbacks. We present observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) which demonstrates that in-field phasing does lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity. We also show, using observations of the millisecond pulsar J1120$-$3618 that this in turn leads to a significant improvement of measurements of the Dispersion Measure and Time of Arrival. Finally, we present test observations of the GMRT discovered eclipsing black widow pulsar J1544+4937 showing that in-field phasing leads to improvement in the measurement of the cut-off frequency of the eclipse.</description>

      <title>Spectro-polarimetric view of the gamma-ray emitting NLS1 1H0323+342</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies are a unique class of objects that launch powerful jets from relatively lower-mass black hole systems compared to the Blazars. However, the black hole masses estimated from the total flux spectrum suffer from the projection effect, making the mass measurement highly uncertain. The polarized spectrum provides a unique view of the central engine through scattered light. We performed spectro-polarimetric observations of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H0323+342 using \textit{SPOL/MMT}. The degree of polarization and polarization angle are 0.122 $\pm$ 0.040\% and 142 $\pm$ 9 degrees, while the H$\alpha$ line is polarized at 0.265 $\pm$ 0.280\%. We decomposed the total flux spectrum and estimated broad H$\alpha$ FWHM of 1015 \kms^{-1}. The polarized flux spectrum shows a broadening similar to the total flux spectrum, with a broadening ratio of 1.22. The Monte Carlo radiative transfer code `STOKES' applied to the data provides the best fit for a small viewing angle of 9-24 degrees and a small optical depth ratio between the polar and the equatorial scatters. A thick BLR with significant scale height can explain a similar broadening of the polarized spectrum compared to the total flux spectrum with a small viewing angle.</description>

      <title>Inferring the spin distribution of binary black holes using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin characteristics of black holes offer valuable insights into the evolutionary pathways of their progenitor stars, crucial for understanding the broader population properties of black holes. Traditional Hierarchical Bayesian inference techniques employed to discern these properties often entail substantial time investments, and consensus regarding the spin distribution of Binary Black Hole (BBH) systems remains elusive. In this study, leveraging observations from GWTC-3, we adopt a machine learning approach to infer the spin distribution of black holes within BBH systems. Specifically, we develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and train it using data generated from a Beta distribution. Our training strategy, involving the segregation of data into 10 bins, not only expedites model training but also enhances the DNN's versatility and adaptability to accommodate the burgeoning volume of gravitational wave observations. Utilizing Monte Carlo-bootstrap (MC-bootstrap) to generate observation-simulated samples, we derive spin distribution parameters: $\alpha=1.3^{+0.25}_{-0.18},\beta=1.70^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ for the larger BH sample and $\alpha=1.37^{+0.31}_{-0.20},\beta=1.63^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$ for the smaller BH sample. Within our constraints, the distributions of component spin magnitudes suggest the likelihood of both black holes in the BBH merger possessing non-zero spin.</description>

      <title>Searching Accretion-Enhanced Dark Matter Annihilation Signals in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study reanalyzes the detection prospects of dark matter (DM) annihilation signals in the Galactic Center, focusing on velocity-dependent dynamics within a spike density near the supermassive black hole (Sgr~A$^{\star}$). We investigate three annihilation processes -- $p$-wave, resonance, and forbidden annihilation -- under semi-relativistic velocities, leveraging gamma-ray data from Fermi and DAMPE telescopes. Our analysis integrates a fermionic DM model with an electroweak axion-like particle (ALP) portal, exploring annihilation into two or four photons. Employing a comprehensive six-dimensional integration, we precisely calculate DM-induced gamma-ray fluxes near Sgr~A$^{\star}$, incorporating velocity and positional dependencies in the annihilation cross-section and photon yield spectra. Our findings highlight scenarios of resonance and forbidden annihilation, where the larger ALP-DM-DM coupling constant $C_{a\chi\chi}$ can affect spike density, potentially yielding detectable gamma-ray line spectra within Fermi and DAMPE energy resolution. We set upper limits for $C_{a\chi\chi}$ across these scenarios, offering insights into the detectability and spectral characteristics of DM annihilation signals from the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>The curvature dependence of gravitational-wave tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy extensions to General Relativity modify the Einstein-Hilbert action with higher-order curvature corrections and theory-specific coupling constants. The order of these corrections imprints a universal curvature dependence on observations while the coupling constant controls the deviation strength. In this Letter, we leverage the theory-independent expectation that modifications to the action of a given order in spacetime curvature (Riemann tensor and contractions) lead to observational deviations that scale with the system length-scale to a corresponding power. Focusing on gravitational wave observations, the relevant scale is the binary total mass, and deviations scale as a power of mass $p$ related to the action order. For example, $p=4,6$ arise in effective field theory for cubic and quartic theories respectively. We incorporate this universal scaling into theory-agnostic tests of General Relativity with current gravitational-wave observations, thus enabling constraints on the curvature scaling without compromising the agnostic nature of these tests. This introduces a flexible yet highly interpretable new paradigm for tests of General Relativity with gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <title>Competition of magnetic reconnections in self-generated and external magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the competition of magnetic reconnections in self-generated and external magnetic fields in laser-produced plasmas. The temporal evolution of plasma structures measured with self-emission imaging shows the vertical expansions and horizontal separation of plasma, which can be signatures of reconnection outflows in self-generated and external magnetic fields, respectively. Because the outflows in self-generated magnetic fields are not clear in the presence of the external magnetic field, the external magnetic field can suppress the magnetic reconnection in self-generated magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Underluminous tidal disruptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have evidence of X-ray flares in several galaxies consistent with a a star being tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (MBH). If the star starts on a nearly parabolic orbit relative to the MBH, one can derive that the fallback rate follows a $t^{-5/3}$ decay. Depending on the penetration factor, $\beta$, a star will be torn apart differently, and relativistic effects play a role. We have modified the standard version of the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code {\sc Gadget} to include a relativistic treatment of the gravitational forces between the gas particles of a main-sequence (MS) star and a MBH. We include non-spinning post-Newtonian corrections to incorpore the periapsis shift and the spin-orbit coupling up to next-to-lowest order. We find that tidal disruptions around MBHs in the relativistic cases are underluminous for values starting at $\beta \gtrapprox 2.25$; i.e. the fallback curves produced in the relativistic cases are progressively lower compared to the Newtonian simulations as the penetration parameter increases. While the Newtonian cases display a total disruption, we find that all relativistic counterparts feature a survival core for penetration factors going to values as high as $12.05$. We perform a additional dynamical numerical study which shows that the geodesics of the elements in the star converge at periapsis. We confirm these findings with an analytical study of the geodesic separation equation. The luminosity of TDEs must be lower than predicted theoretically due to the fact that the star will partially survive when relativistic effects are taken into account. A survival core should consistently emerge from any TDE with $\beta \gtrapprox 2.25$.</description>

      <title>Redback: A Bayesian inference software package for electromagnetic transients</title>

Abstract: Fulfilling the rich promise of rapid advances in time-domain astronomy is only possible through confronting our observations with physical models and extracting the parameters that best describe what we see. Here, we introduce {\sc Redback}; a Bayesian inference software package for electromagnetic transients. {\sc Redback} provides an object-orientated {\sc python} interface to over 12 different samplers and over 100 different models for kilonovae, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, engine-driven transients among other explosive transients. The models range in complexity from simple analytical and semi-analytical models to surrogates built upon numerical simulations accelerated via machine learning. {\sc Redback} also provides a simple interface for downloading and processing data from various catalogs such as \textit{Swift} and Fink. The software can also serve as an engine to simulate transients for telescopes such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin with realistic cadences, limiting magnitudes, and sky-coverage or a hypothetical user-constructed survey or a generic transient for target-of-opportunity observations with different telescopes. As a demonstration of its capabilities, we show how {\sc Redback} can be used to jointly fit the spectrum and photometry of a kilonova, enabling a more powerful, holistic probe into the properties of a transient. We also showcase general examples of how {\sc Redback} can be used as a tool to simulate transients for realistic surveys, fit models to real, simulated, or private data, multi-messenger inference with gravitational waves, and serve as an end-to-end software toolkit for parameter estimation and interpreting the nature of electromagnetic transients.</description>

      <title>Type Ia Supernovae Can Arise from the Detonations of Both Stars in a Double Degenerate Binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is unknown despite their value to numerous areas in astronomy. While it is a long-standing consensus that they arise from an explosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, the exact progenitor configurations and explosion mechanisms that lead to SNe Ia are still debated. One popular theory is the double detonation in which a helium layer, accreted from a binary companion, detonates on the surface of the primary star, leading to a converging shock-induced detonation of the underlying core. It has recently been seen in simulations that a helium-rich degenerate companion may undergo its own explosion triggered by the impact from the ejecta of the primary star. We show 2D simulations that approximate a white dwarf undergoing a double detonation which triggers the explosion of the degenerate companion, leading to either a triple or quadruple detonation. We also present the first multi-dimensional radiative transfer results from the triple and quadruple detonation scenario. We find that within a range of mass configurations of the degenerate binary, the synthetic light curves and spectra of these events match observations as well as theoretical models of isolated double detonations do. Notably, double and quadruple detonations that are spectrally similar and reach the same peak brightnesses have drastically different ejection masses and produce different amounts of Si- and Fe-group elements. Further understanding of this scenario is needed in order to determine if at least some observed SNe Ia actually originate from two stars exploding.</description>

      <title>Simulation of radio signals from cosmic-ray cascades in air and ice as observed by in-ice Askaryan radio detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino observatories will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive analysis toward the Fermi-LAT source 4FGL J1846.9-0227: Jets of a proto-planetary nebula producing gamma-rays?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the $\gamma$-ray sources in the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalogue are associated with pulsars and blazars. However, unveiling the nature of the still unassociated $\gamma$-ray sources is important for the understanding of high energy emission mechanisms in astrophysical objects. This work presents a comprehensive study towards the region covered by the Fermi source 4FGL J1846.9$-$0227, previously suggested to be a blazar and a massive protostar. Using multiwavelength observations, we analysed several astrophysical objects in the region as possible counterparts of the Fermi-LAT source. Having discarded most of them after a detailed and comprehensive analysis, we suggest that the most likely candidate to be such a counterpart is IRAS 18443$-$0231, a likely proto-planetary nebula. We found that the radio continuum emission at 3 GHz of IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows a compact source related to faint emission with jet-like morphology. Additionally, we identified an associated red-shifted CO molecular outflow. Using data from several catalogues, we obtained radio spectral index values ranging from $-$0.57 to $-$0.39 for IRAS 18443$-$0231, indicating syncrothron emission due to particles accelerated by the jets. We point out that these jets could explain the $\gamma$-ray emission through mechanisms such as proton-proton collisions and relativistic Bremsstrahlung. IRAS 18443$-$0231, lying almost at the centre of the Fermi confidence ellipse and related to the hard X-ray source 4XMM J184700.4$-$022752, would be the first association between a proto-planetary nebula and $\gamma$-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Spectro-photometric follow up of the outbursting AM CVn system ASASSN-21br</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on spectroscopic and photometric observations of the AM CVn system ASASSN-21br, which was discovered in outburst by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae in February 2021. The outburst lasted for around three weeks, and exhibited a pronounced brightness dip for $\approx$ 4 days, during which the spectra showed a sudden transition from emission- to absorption-line dominated. Only $\approx$ 60 AM CVn systems with derived orbital periods are found in the Galaxy, therefore increasing the sample of AM CVn systems with known orbital periods is of tremendous importance to (1) constrain the physical mechanisms of their outbursts and (2) establish a better understanding of the low-frequency background noise of future gravitational wave surveys. Time-resolved photometry taken during the outburst of ASASSN-21br showed modulation with a period of around 36.65 minutes, which is likely the superhump or orbital period of the system. Time-resolved spectroscopy taken with the Southern African Large Telescope did not show any sign of periodicity in the He I absorption lines. This is possibly due to the origin of these lines in the outbursting accretion disc, which makes it challenging to retrieve periodicity from the spectral lines. Future follow up spectral observations during quiescence might allow us better constrain the orbital period of ASASSN-21br.</description>

Abstract: Published theoretical data from several models: PHSD and HSD both with and without chiral symmetry restoration (CSR), applied to experimental data on nuclear collisions from BEVALAC and SIS to LHC energies were analyzed using meta-analysis and Kolmogorov criteria. This made it possible to localize possible features of nuclear matter created in central nucleus-nucleus collisions. Ignition of a drop of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) begins already at an energy of about $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2 GeV. We estimate that this QGP droplet occupies a small fraction, 15 $\%$ (average radius of about 5.3 fermi if the fireball radius is 10 fermi) of the total volume of the fireball created at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.7 GeV. A drop of exotic matter undergoes a split phase transition: separated boundaries of sharp (1st order) crossover and CSR in chiral limit, between QGP and Quarkyonic matter at an energy about $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.5 GeV. The critical endpoint of 2nd order probably cannot be reached in nuclear collisions. The triple phase area occupies interval from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 12 GeV to 15 GeV, the critical endpoint of 1st order at around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 20 GeV. The boundary of smooth (2nd order) crossover transition with CSR in chiral limit between Quarkyonic matter and QGP was localized between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.3 GeV and 12 GeV, and between Hadronic and QGP in the interval from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 15 GeV to 20 GeV, the boundary of sharp (1st order) crossover transition with CSR in chiral limit between Hadronic matter and QGP was localized after $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 20 GeV. The phase trajectory of the hadronic corona, enveloping the exotic droplet, always remains in the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Measuring the nuclear equation of state with neutron star-black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers are sensitive to the nuclear equation of state (EOS). We present a new methodology for EOS inference with non-parametric Gaussian process (GP) priors, enabling direct constraints on the pressure at specific densities and the length-scale of correlations on the EOS. Using realistic simulations of NSBH mergers, incorporating both GW and electromagnetic (EM) selection to ensure sample purity, we find that a GW detector network operating at O5-sensitivities will constrain the radius of a $\unit[1.4]{M_{\odot}}$ NS and the maximum NS mass with $1.6\%$ and $13\%$ precision, respectively. With the same sample, the projected constraint on the length-scale of correlations in the EOS is $\geq~\unit[3.2]{MeV~fm^{-3}}$. These results demonstrate strong potential for insights into the nuclear EOS from NSBH systems, provided they are robustly identified.</description>

Abstract: We study the black hole mass $-$ host galaxy stellar mass relation, $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$, of a sample of $z&lt;4$ optically-variable AGNs in the COSMOS field. The parent sample of 491 COSMOS AGNs were identified by optical variability from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) program. Using publicly-available catalogs and spectra, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts and estimate virial black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities. We show that variability searches with deep, high precision photometry like the HSC-SSP can identity AGNs in low mass galaxies up to $z\sim1$. However, their black holes are more massive given their host galaxy stellar masses than predicted by the local relation for active galaxies. We report that $z\sim 0.5-4$ variability-selected AGNs are meanwhile more consistent with the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for local inactive early-type galaxies. This result is consistent with most previous studies of the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation at similar redshifts and indicates that AGNs selected from variability are not intrinsically different from the broad-line Type 1 AGN population at similar luminosities. Our results demonstrate the need for robust black hole and stellar mass estimates for intermediate-mass black hole candidates in low-mass galaxies at similar redshifts. Assuming that these results do not reflect a selection bias, they appear to be consistent with self-regulated feedback models wherein the central black hole and stars in galaxies grow in tandem.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the old idea of using the moon as a resonant gravitational-wave (GW) detector, as well as the recent updates in modeling the lunar response to GWs, we re-evaluate the feasibility of using a network of lunar seismometers to constrain the stochastic GW background (SGWB). In particular, using the updated model of the lunar response, we derive the pattern functions for the two polarizations of GW. With these pattern functions, we further calculate the overlap reduction functions for a network of lunar seismometers, where we have relaxed the conventional assumption that lunar seismometers are perfectly leveled to measure only the vertical acceleration. We apply our calculation to two future lunar projects, namely, Chang'e and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that the two projects could constrain the SGWB to a level of $\Omega_{\text{GW}}^{\text{Chang'e}} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{2}$ and $\Omega_{\text{GW}}^{\text{LGWA}} &lt; 2.0 \times 10^{-10}$, respectively, which corresponds to a signal-to-noise ratio of SNR $=3$. These results are better than the constraints placed previously on the SGWB in the mid-frequency band (around $10^{-3}- 10~\text{Hz}$) by various types of experiments.</description>

Abstract: Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered binaries containing single BHs and visible stars without mass transfer, so-called Gaia BHs. One important question is if Gaia BHs have binary BHs (BBHs), hereafter Gaia BBHs, instead of single BHs. We have investigated how efficiently Gaia BBHs are formed in open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of Gaia BHs, by means of gravitational $N$-body simulations. Limiting Gaia BHs' periods to $10^2$-$10^4$ days, we have found that there are no Gaia BBHs in the solar-metallicity environments, while the formation efficiency of Gaia BBHs is not small ($\sim 10^{-6} M_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ % of Gaia BHs) in subsolar-metallicity environments. However, the probability of Gaia BBHs hidden in Gaia BHs is only $\sim 1$ %. This is because most of the BBHs merge within $1$ Gyr through gravitational wave radiation. Note that the ages of discovered Gaia BHs are more than $1$ Gyr. If we extend Gaia BHs' periods to $10^4$-$10^5$ days, the probability becomes higher to $\sim 10$ %. In this case, a large fraction of BBHs can have enough wide orbits not to merge within the Hubble time. The probability would not be high for Gaia BHs already discovered and to be discovered in the near future. Nevertheless, we have shown the BH/BBH mass, visible star mass, and eccentricity distributions of Gaia BHs and Gaia BBHs, which will be helpful for follow-up observations to discover Gaia BBHs. A Gaia BH would be more likely to be a Gaia BBH if it has younger age, longer period, lower-mass companion, more circular orbit, lower metallicity, and more massive BH. Our results have implied that Gaia BH3 is unlikely to be a Gaia BBH.</description>
