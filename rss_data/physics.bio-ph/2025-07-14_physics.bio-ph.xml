      <title>PTM-Psi on the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an advanced computational architecture to accelerate Post-Translational Modifications on protein structures and interactions (PTM-Psi) simulations utilizing asynchronous, loosely coupled workflows on the Azure Quantum Elements platform. The cloud architecture harnessed inherent task parallelism to enhance simulation throughput and dynamically allocate computational resources to optimize efficiency. Here, we seamlessly integrate emerging cloud computing assets that further expand the scope and capability of PTM-Psi simulations beyond current limitations. By refactoring the existing PTM-Psi workflow using well-established software, including Alphafold2, NWChem, GROMACS, and Python-based analysis tools into a cloud-native library, we optimized resource allocation tailored to each workflow's needs for scaling up the PTM-Psi simulation. We employed a ``flow-of-workflow'' approach in which the cloud architecture supports the computational investigation of a combinatorial explosion of thiol PTMs on an exemplary protein megacomplex critical to the Calvin-Benson cycle of light-dependent sugar production in cyanobacteria. With PTM-Psi on the cloud, we transformed the pipeline for the thiol PTM analysis to achieve high throughput by leveraging the strengths of the cloud service. PTM-Psi on the cloud reduces operational complexity and lowers entry barriers to data interpretation with structural modeling for a redox proteomics mass spectrometry specialist.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy Analysis of Isolated Melanosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melanosomes are organelles found in a wide variety of tissues throughout the animal kingdom. They contain a variety of biological molecules, but the dominant constituent is the pigment melanin, and many functions ascribed to melanosomes, such as photoprotection, are uniquely enabled by the chemical properties and structures of the melanins they contain. In this report, we used, for the first time, Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to examine fluorescent properties of pigments in melanosomes and evaluate their time evolution upon extended laser irradiation. We discovered a relatively short-lived component in fluorescence emission and revealed significant changes in lifetimes upon irradiation indicating structural photoinduced changes to melanin occurring on a time scale of minutes, with observations extending up to one hour.</description>

      <title>Probing the single neurotransmitters with the WGM microcavity-hybridized plasmonic nanospiked antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discerning the neurotransmitter dysregulation is a hallmark of neurological disorders and diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis. The concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft is particularly low, ranging from nM to fM, which makes it challenging to accurately monitor changes over the course of a clinical trial using existing sensing techniques. By means of an advanced whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensor hybridized with plasmonic nanospiked antennas, we detect and discriminate between different neurotransmitters at the single-molecule level. Our results show that the sensor can detect neurotransmitters with exceptional sensitivity down to 10 aM and discriminate between structurally similar neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate, over a large number of detection events. Furthermore, we find that the average WGM resonance shift, induced by a neurotransmitter binding to the sensor, strongly correlates with molecular polarizability values obtained from electronic structure calculations. These findings establish the optoplasmonic WGM sensors as potential biosensor platform in different avenues of neuroscience by detecting and discriminating neurotransmitters as well as investigating their dynamics at ultra low-level concentrations, plausibly contributing to deeper understanding of brain function and neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Exogeneous PpIX model for brain tumour assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable in-vitro models are used for optoelectronic device development such as fluorescence detection devices for fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas. A common approach is based on inducing gliomas in animal models. This is followed by a dosage of 5-ALA to induce Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the glioma and which fluoresces. Although these approaches excel in capturing key biomolecular and physiological features of the tumour, they are inherently indeterministic. This limits the scope of their use for preclinical device development, where consistent and controllable tumour reproduction across multiple animals is needed. Approaches using fluorescence markers in gelatine provide a simple replication but fail to capture the complexities of in-vivo models. In this study, we introduce an exogenous brain tumour model for assessing PpIX fluorescence detection. The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution into the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site simulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region had a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease towards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was compared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other reported works, achieving a correlation of R2&gt;0.93. The model's validity was tested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence (AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was analysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain sample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to maintain moisture and preserve AF. The model accurately replicated surgical fluorescence conditions and offers a suitable alternative to glioma induction, benefiting the development of fluorescence detection devices across design iterations.</description>

      <title>Co-evolutionary Balance State of the Autism inter-Brain Network: A Neurofunctional Framework for Biomarker Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social communication and repetitive behaviors; however, objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain lacking. We propose a coevolutionary balance paradigm that quantifies network level energy via a Hamiltonian integrating regional activity measured by fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and resting state functional connectivity (FC). Analysis of resting state fMRI data from 93 adult males with ASD and 93 matched controls revealed that empirical networks showed lower energy than 1000 topology preserving null models (paired t = -4.12, p less than or equal to 1e-4). Participants with ASD exhibited more negative whole brain energy (t = -3.239, p = 0.0015), driven by increased agreement links and reduced imbalanced same motifs. Subnetwork analysis indicated greater energy in the Default Mode Network after false discovery rate correction (p less than 0.016) and enhanced energy between the Default Mode, Salience and Dorsal Attention networks (p less than 0.032). Energy metrics and inter network connectivity correlated with Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule severity scores (absolute correlation greater than or equal to 0.29, p less than 0.02). A k nearest neighbors classifier using nine principal features including motif proportions, global node link alignment, inter network fALFF weighted and FC strengths, subnetwork magnetization and pairwise energy achieved an accuracy of 79 percent with balanced sensitivity and specificity. These results demonstrate that coevolutionary energy detects interpretable network disruptions and establishes a robust framework for ASD classification.</description>

      <title>Effect of diversity distribution symmetry on global oscillations of networks of excitable units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the degree of symmetry of the diversity distribution in shaping the collective dynamics of networks of coupled excitable units modeled by FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. While previous studies have focused primarily on the ratio between the numbers of individually oscillatory and excitable units, we show that the symmetry of the diversity distribution plays a fundamental role in the emergence of global network oscillations. By exploring various symmetric and asymmetric distributions and simulating network dynamics across various topologies, we demonstrate that symmetric distributions promote resonant collective oscillations even in the absence of oscillatory units. We propose two quantitative metrics, the normalized center of mass and the symmetry balance score, to assess the degree of symmetry and predict the presence or absence of global oscillations. By studying a minimal two-unit system and its effective pseudo-potential, we show that symmetry enables the formation of a landscape characterized by a cyclic valley supporting limit cycles, whereas asymmetry collapses the system into a single non-oscillatory equilibrium. These results provide a general mechanism by which network symmetry drives emergent synchronization in heterogeneous excitable systems.</description>

      <title>An energy landscape-based theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of functions in a living system under the dynamical component interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a living system composed of interacting components such as molecules, cells, and tissues, each component often adaptively changes its internal states in response to interactions with its surrounding components. For example, individual tissues exhibit component-level adaptive behavior, such as growth and remodeling, in response to their mechanical interactions, resulting in the emergence of functions of a multi-tissue system. Along with the adaptive behavior of the components, their interactions exhibit dynamical changes, which strongly influence the emergence of system functions. To understand how the emergence of system functions occurs from such dynamical interactions due to component-level adaptive behavior, this study proposes a theoretical framework that formulates the dynamics of interactions among components due to the adaptive behavior of individual components. For modeling the adaptive internal state changes, we assign an energy landscape and its associated energy rate landscape for each component, leading to the generalized gradient flow model of adaptive behavior. Then, we represent interaction dynamics based on temporal changes in these energy and energy rate landscapes by formulating temporal changes in the environmental states of each component due to the adaptive behavior of individual components. Through case studies using simplified models of mechanically interacting tissues under morphological changes, our theoretical framework demonstrates that temporal changes in applied forces due to morphological changes of individual tissues determine the emergence of system functions. These findings highlight that expressing interaction dynamics based on temporal changes in energy and energy rate landscapes offers a powerful theoretical framework for understanding how system functions emerge from component-level adaptive behavior.</description>

      <title>Integrating nano- and micrometer-scale energy deposition models for mechanistic prediction of radiation-induced DNA damage and cell survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an integrated modeling framework that combines the Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model (GSM2), used to predict cell survival fractions, with MINAS-TIRITH, a fast and efficient Geant4 DNA-based tool for simulating radiation-induced DNA damage in cell populations. This approach enables the generation of spatially and structurally resolved double-strand break (DSB) distributions, capturing key features such as damage complexity and chromosome specificity. A novel application of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is introduced to group DSBs at the micrometer scale. This allows the identification of physical aggregates of DNA damage and their association with subnuclear domains, providing a direct link to the cell survival probability as predicted by \gsm.
  The model was validated using experimental data from HUVEC cells irradiated with 220 kV X-rays and H460 cells exposed to protons over a wide linear energy transfer (LET) range, from approximately 4 keV/{\mu}m to over 20 keV/{\mu}m. Results show excellent agreement between simulations and experimental survival probabilities, making this one of the first consistent multi-scale models to bridge nanodosimetric and microdosimetric representations of radiation with biological outcomes such as cell survival.
  By incorporating the inherent stochastic nature of radiation-matter interactions, this framework effectively connects the physical properties of the radiation field to the biological response at the cellular level. Its accuracy across various radiation types and energies supports its potential for use in biologically optimized radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>How Easy Is It to Learn Motion Models from Widefield Fluorescence Single Particle Tracks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion models are often deduced from fluorescence widefield tracking experiments by analyzing single-particle trajectories post-processed from the data. This analysis immediately raises the following question: To what degree is our ability to learn motion models impacted by analyzing post-processed trajectories versus the raw measurements? To answer this question, we mathematically formulate a data likelihood for diffraction-limited fluorescence widefield tracking experiments. In particular, we explicitly make the likelihood's dependence on the motion model versus the emission model (or measurement model). The emission model describes how photons emitted by fluorescently labeled particles are distributed in space according to the optical point spread function, with intensities subsequently integrated over a pixel, and convoluted with camera noise. Logic dictates that if the data likelihood is primarily informed by the motion model, then it should be straightforward to learn the motion model from the trajectory post-processed from the data. On the other hand, if the majority of the likelihood is numerically dominated by the emission model, then the post-processed trajectory inferred from data is primarily informed by the emission model, and very little information on the motion model permeates into the post-processed trajectories analyzed downstream to learn motion models. We find that for typical diffraction-limited fluorescence experiments, the emission model often robustly contributes approximately 99% to the likelihood, leaving motion models to explain approximately 1% of the data. This result immediately casts doubt on our ability to reliably learn motion models from post-processed data, raising further questions on the significance of motion models learned thus far from post-processed single-particle trajectories from single-molecule widefield fluorescence tracking experiments.</description>

      <title>Correlation-weighted 23Na magnetic resonance fingerprinting in the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a new sodium magnetic resonance fingerprinting ($^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF) method for the simultaneous mapping of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$ and sodium density with built-in $\Delta\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ (radiofrequency transmission inhomogeneities) and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ corrections (frequency offsets). We based our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF implementation on a 3D FLORET sequence with 23 radiofrequency pulses. To capture the complex spin ${\frac{\text{3}}{\text{2}}}$ dynamics of the $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ nucleus, the fingerprint dictionary was simulated using the irreducible spherical tensor operators formalism. The dictionary contained 831,512 entries covering a wide range of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$, $\Delta\text{B}_\text{1}^{+}$ factor and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ parameters. Fingerprint matching was performed using the Pearson correlation and the resulting relaxation maps were weighted with a subset of the highest correlation coefficients corresponding to signal matches for each voxel. Our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF method was compared against reference methods in a 7-compartment phantom, and applied in brain in five healthy volunteers at 7 T. In phantoms, $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF produced values comparable to those obtained with reference methods. Average sodium relaxation time values in cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter across five healthy volunteers were in good agreement with values previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</description>
