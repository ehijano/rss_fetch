      <title>Calculating the Total Cherenkov Radiation Emitted by Low Energy Protons in Liquid Argon and Comparing with Argon Scintillation Light at 128 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino experiments using liquid argon (LAr) detectors estimate the amount of light produced by different types of particles, but only consider scintillation light, at 128 nm, ignoring Cherenkov light contributions. This research aims to theoretically compare these two contributions to the total amount of light produced between ~ 128 - 500 nm for a proton travelling in LAr and explores how to leverage these under-utilized observables for future detector applications.
  A new theoretical fit of the refractive index of LAr was performed using recent experimental data, which incorporates the physics of anomalous dispersion in the UV resonance for the first time. Using this fit, we integrate the Frank-Tamm (FT) formula to calculate the instantaneous Cherenkov angular distribution and yield of a proton with a given kinetic energy, as well as the integrated distribution and yield over its trajectory. We compare our results with those obtained using two other non-absorptive refractive index fits available in the literature. Because those fits diverge at the resonance, they significantly overestimate the yield.</description>

      <title>Dark Dwarfs: Dark Matter-Powered Sub-Stellar Objects Awaiting Discovery at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter annihilation on objects with masses close to the sub-stellar limit, finding that the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning is larger than the $\sim0.075 M_\odot $ value predicted in the Standard Model. Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark matter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this transition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and circular velocity $v_{\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We predict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the dark matter density is expected to be $\rho_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$. At larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects to have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their initial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it, providing a method for detecting them.</description>

      <title>On Lepton Number Violation in the Type II Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the prospect of observing genuine lepton number violating (LNV) signals at hadron colliders in the context of the Type II seesaw mechanism. The model features smoking gun signals involving same-sign di-leptons and jets that may be the primary observable channel in certain regions of the parameter space. The flavour composition of final-state charged leptons in the minimal model is related to the origin of neutrino masses and is correlated with other rare processes, such as neutrinoless double beta decay. We review existing collider limits and provide sensitivity estimates from LNV signals at upcoming runs of the LHC, for zero and non-zero mass splittings between the scalar triplet components.</description>

      <title>Large CP violation in flavor violating muon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify new room for CP violation in lepton flavor violating observables not bound by the electric dipole moment of leptons. By focusing on new physics in the muon-electron sector, we show that CP violation can make its first appearance in lepton flavor violating muon decays rather than in the electric dipole moment of the electron, further motivating the experimental program of Mu3e. We tackle this issue by performing the full one-loop running and matching from the low energy observables at the muon scale, including the T-odd asymmetry in $\mu\to3e$ decays, to the Standard Model effective field theory above the electroweak scale. We then sketch a simple UV model that can give rise to these patterns.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark energy on the structure of neutron stars: The vacuum case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential role of a cosmic vacuum dark component in the properties of neutron stars is investigated. It is assumed that the static, spherically symmetric distribution of matter within neutron stars is supported by two distinct components: ordinary matter and a vacuum fluid. For normal matter we use a set of state-of-the-art nuclear matter equations of state, each grounded in nuclear physics experiments. The vacuum energy component is inhomogeneously distributed within the star and obeys the standard equation of state ($p_v = -\epsilon_v$). This is characterized by an energy density fraction $y = \epsilon_m/ (\epsilon_m + \epsilon_v)$, which we model as either a constant or radius-dependent. Our findings reveal that the inclusion of vacuum energy significantly affects the mass-radius relationships in neutron stars, influencing both the maximum achievable masses and the qualitative form of these relationships. Some constraints from current multimessenger observational data limiting the amount of vacuum energy within neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Higgs boson production at $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Higgs boson production at $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders at high energy. Since both initial-state particles are positively charged, there is no $W$ boson fusion at the leading order, as it requires a $W^+ W^-$ pair. However, we find that the cross section of the higher-order, $\gamma$- and $Z$-mediated $W$ boson fusion process is large at high center-of-mass energies $\sqrt s$, growing as $(\log s)^3$. This is in contrast to the $\log s$ behavior of the leading-order $W$ boson fusion. Thus, even though it is a higher-order process, the rate of Higgs boson production for 10 TeV energies at $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders with polarized beams can be as high as about half of the one at $\mu^+ \mu^-$ colliders, assuming the same integrated luminosity. To calculate the cross section of this process accurately, we carefully treat the collinear emission of the photon in the intermediate state. The thereby obtained large cross section furthermore shows the significance of Higgs production with an extra $W$ boson in the final state also at $\mu^+ \mu^-$ and $e^+ e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <title>Model Independent Tests of the Hadronic Vacuum Polarization Contribution to the Muon $g$$-$$2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contributions to the muon $g$$-$$2$ are the crucial quantity to resolve whether new physics is present or not in the comparison between the Standard Model (SM) prediction and experimental measurements at Fermilab. They are commonly and historically determined via dispersion relations using a vast catalogue of experimentally measured, low-energy $e^+e^-\to \,\rm{hadrons}$ cross section data as input. These dispersive estimates result in a SM prediction that exhibits a muon $g$$-$$2$ discrepancy of more than $5\sigma$ when compared to experiment. However, recent lattice QCD evaluations of the HVP and a new hadronic cross section measurement from the CMD-3 experiment favor a no-new-physics scenario and, therefore, exhibit a common tension with the previous $e^+e^-\to \,\rm{hadrons}$ data. This study explores the current and future implications of these two scenarios on other observables that are also sensitive to the HVP contributions in the hope that they may provide independent tests of the current tensions observed in the muon $g$$-$$2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a parton analysis within $\texttt{xFitter}$ to determine the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) at next-to-leading order (NLO) at moderate-to-low $x$ using the measurements of exclusive $J/\psi$ production in $ep$ and $pp$ collisions from HERA and LHC. We further study the constraints from the corresponding $\Upsilon$ production process and finish by discussing the possible effects at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) through incorporation of a $K$ factor for the exclusive heavy vector-meson coefficient function at NLO.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Traditional Methods and Machine Learning Algorithms for Tagging Boosted Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in deep learning in collider physics has been growing in recent years, specifically in applying these methods in jet classification, anomaly detection, particle identification etc. Among those, jet classification using neural networks is one of the well-established areas. In this review, we discuss different tagging frameworks available to tag boosted objects, especially boosted Higgs boson and top quark, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our aim is to study the interplay of traditional jet substructure based methods with the state-of-the-art machine learning ones. In this methodology, we would gain some interpretability of those machine learning methods, and which in turn helps to propose hybrid taggers relevant for tagging of those boosted objects belonging to both Standard Model (SM) and physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Type-II seesaw of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for predictability of lepton masses and mixing patterns of type-II seesaw scenario in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry recently proposed by "Qu" and "Ding". We propose three types of minimum predictive models with different assignments of modular weight, satisfying the neutrino oscillation data in Nufit 5.2. The cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino mass is stringent to our models and CMB bound $\sum D_\nu\le0.12$ eV can be satisfied by one of three models playing an important role in discriminating them.</description>

      <title>Impact of new particles on the ratio of Electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the electromagnetic form factors ratio in the Rosenbluth and polarization methods. We explore the impact of adding new particles as the mediators in the electron-proton scattering on these ratios. Consequently, we find some bound on the scalar coupling as $\alpha_{sc}\sim 10^{-5}$ for $m_{sc}\sim 5 MeV-2 GeV$ and $\alpha_{sc}\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for $m_{sc}\sim 2-10 GeV$. Meanwhile, the vector coupling is bounded as $\alpha_v\sim 10^{-5}$ for $m_v\sim 5 MeV-1.1 GeV$ and $\alpha_v\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for $m_v\sim 1.2-10 GeV$. These constraints are in complete agreement with those which is found from other independent experiments.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnetization and effective interactions in QGP at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quark-gluon plasma (QGP), at higher deconfinement temperatures $T \ge T_d$ the spontaneous generation of color magnetic fields, $b^3(T), b^8(T) \not = 0$ (3, 8 are color indexes), and usual magnetic field $b(T) \not = 0$ happens. Simultaneously, the Polyakov loop and/or algebraically related to it $A_0(T)$ condensate, which is solution to Yang-Mills imaginary time equations, are also created. Usually, in analytic quantum field theory these effects are investigated independently of each other within the effective potentials having different mathematical structures. The common generation of these condensates was detected in lattice Monte Carlo simulations.
  Recently, with the new type two-loop effective potential, which generalizes the known integral representation for the Bernoulli polynomials and takes into consideration the magnetic background, this effect has been derived analytically.
  The corresponding effective potential W(T, b^3, A_0 ) was investigated either in SU(2) gluodynamics or full QCD. The gauge fixing independence of it was proved within the Nielsen identity approach. The values of magnetic field strengths at different temperatures were calculated and the mechanism of stabilizing fields due to A_0(T) condensate has been discovered. In the present review, we describe this important phenomenon in more details, as well as a number of specific effects - induced color charges, effective photon-photon-gluon vertexes - happening due to vacuum polarization at this background. They could serve as the signals of the QGP creation in the heavy ion collision experiments.
  Key words: spontaneous magnetization, high temperature, asymptotic freedom, effective potential, A_0 condensate, effective charge, effective vertexes.</description>

      <title>Pole analysis for the $D^{*}\bar K$-$D\bar{K^*}$ coupled-channel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, possible hadronic molecules in the $D^*\bar K$-$D\bar K^*$ coupled-channel system are investigated with the one-meson exchange potentials, where both vector and pseudoscalar mesons are considered as exchange particles. We find an S-wave virtual state with mass $2472(18)$ MeV, and a resonance with mass $M=2747(31)$ and width $\Gamma=7(3)$ MeV. In the $D^* \bar K$ invariant mass distribution, the virtual state appears as a cusp at the $D^*\bar K$ threshold, while the resonance potentially manifests as a dip. In particular, we take into account the $D\bar K \pi$ three-body dynamics due to the on-shell pion exchange and the finite decay widths for $D^*$ and $\bar K^*$. Additionally, the cutoff dependence and the SU(4) breaking effect are investigated in our work. Our results also indicate that the accurate measurement for the decay width of the $D\bar K^*$ resonance can help us to evaluate the SU(4) breaking effect in the future.</description>

Abstract: We present detailed analysis of the $T$-even lepton angular distribution in the Drell-Yan process including $\gamma/Z^0$ gauge boson exchange and using perturbative QCD based on the collinear factorization scheme at leading order in the $\alpha_s$ expansion. We focus on the study of the transverse momentum $Q_T$ dependence of the corresponding hadronic structure functions and angular coefficients up to next-next-to-leading order in the $Q_T^2/Q^2$ expansion. We analyze $Q_T$ dependence numerically and compare $T$-even angular coefficients integrated over rapidity with available data of the ATLAS Collaboration at LHC. Additionally, we present our results for the forward-backward asymmetry and compare it with data.</description>

      <title>QCD evolution of entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has emerged as a novel tool for probing nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phenomena, such as color confinement in protons. While recent studies have demonstrated its significant capability in describing hadron production in deep inelastic scatterings, the QCD evolution of entanglement entropy remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the differential rapidity-dependent entanglement entropy within the proton and its connection to final-state hadrons, aiming to elucidate its QCD evolution. Our analysis reveals a strong agreement between the rapidity dependence of von Neumann entropy, obtained from QCD evolution equations, and the corresponding experimental data on hadron entropy. These findings provide compelling evidence for the emergence of a maximally entangled state, offering new insights into the nonperturbative structure of protons.</description>

      <title>Towards UV Models of Kinetic Mixing and Portal Matter: A More Complex Dark Matter Sector?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portal Matter, with both SM and dark charges, induces KM between the $U(1)_D$ dark photon and the SM gauge fields offering an attractive mechanism by which light thermal DM can obtain its observed relic density. If DM is fermionic, the CMB informs us that it must be Majorana/pseudo-Dirac in nature to avoid temperature-independent $s$-wave annihilation to SM states. How does this fit into a more complete picture with the SM? A first step along this path may not lie far away in energy due to the RGE running of the dark gauge coupling which can becomes non-perturbative before the $\sim 10$'s of TeV range. This implies that $U(1)_D$ must become embedded in a non-Abelian group, $G_D$, before this occurs. The breaking of this group then produces the PM masses and the heavy gauge fields associated with $G_D$ lead to new interactions between the SM and the dark sector. In the past we have examined a set of distinctive phenomenological features associated with this setup, based upon a number of simplifying assumptions. It behooves us to explore the impact of these assumptions on the predictions for possible experimental tests of these models. In past analyses we assumed that DM is a VL, complex singlet under $G_D$. If this assumption is relaxed, the dark sector must be augmented by additional fermion(s) and the scalar fields needed to break the symmetries while generating the needed Majorana-like mass terms for the DM. Here we analyze the simplest extension of this kind wherein the DM lies in a VL doublet of $G_D$, which we take to have the structure $SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{Y_I}$, leading to new phenomenology. We find that given the current LHC search constraints on the masses of heavy gauge bosons, the production of these new dark states with large rates is unlikely at colliders unless they are produced singly in $gg$-fusion or are resonantly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Discovering heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations at the $Z$-pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collider-testable type I seesaw extensions of the Standard Model are generally protected by an approximate lepton number (LN) symmetry. Consequently, they predict pseudo-Dirac heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) composed of two nearly degenerate Majorana fields. The interference between the two mass eigenstates can induce heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations (NNOs) leading to observable lepton number violation (LNV), even though the LN symmetry is approximately conserved. These NNOs could be resolved in long-lived HNL searches at collider experiments, such as the proposed Future Circular $e^+e^-$ Collider (FCC-$ee$) or Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). However, during their $Z$-pole runs, the LN carried away by the light (anti)neutrinos produced alongside the HNLs prevents LNV from being observed directly. Nevertheless, NNOs materialise as oscillating signatures in final state distributions. We discuss and compare a selection of such oscillating observables, and perform a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the parameter space in which NNOs could be resolved.</description>

      <title>Searches for ultra-high energy gamma-ray at the Pierre Auger Observatory and implications on super-heavy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first interactions of photon-induced showers are of electromagnetic nature, and the transfer of energy to the hadron/muon channel is reduced with respect to the bulk of hadron-induced showers. This results in a lower number of secondary muons. Additionally, as the development of photon showers is delayed by the typically small multiplicity of electromagnetic interactions, their maximum of shower development is deeper in the atmosphere than for showers initiated by hadrons. These salient features have enabled searches for photon showers at the Pierre Auger Observatory. They have led to stringent upper limits on ultra-high-energy gamma-ray fluxes over four orders in magnitude in energy. These limits are not only of considerable astrophysical interest, but they also allow us to constrain beyond-standard-physics scenarios. For instance, dark matter particles could be superheavy, provided their lifetime is much longer than the age of the universe. Constraints on specific extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics that meet the lifetime requirement for a superheavy particle will be presented. They include limits on instanton strength as well as on mixing angle between active and sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time-Dependent Instrumental Noise for LISA SGWB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variations in the instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) over time are expected as a result of e.g. scheduled satellite operations or unscheduled glitches. We demonstrate that these fluctuations can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires optimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data analysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of mission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for this challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we show by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal information gain can be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Bayesian Generative Machine Learning for Bayesiamplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, combinations of generative and Bayesian machine learning have been introduced in particle physics for both fast detector simulation and inference tasks. These neural networks aim to quantify the uncertainty on the generated distribution originating from limited training statistics. The interpretation of a distribution-wide uncertainty however remains ill-defined. We show a clear scheme for quantifying the calibration of Bayesian generative machine learning models. For a Continuous Normalizing Flow applied to a low-dimensional toy example, we evaluate the calibration of Bayesian uncertainties from either a mean-field Gaussian weight posterior, or Monte Carlo sampling network weights, to gauge their behaviour on unsteady distribution edges. Well calibrated uncertainties can then be used to roughly estimate the number of uncorrelated truth samples that are equivalent to the generated sample and clearly indicate data amplification for smooth features of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the parity-doublet model: Asymmetric and neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider isospin-asymmetric matter in the parity-doublet model within an extended mean-field calculation, increasing continuously the neutron excess all the way to pure neutron matter. We compute the liquid-gas and the chiral phase transitions occurring at zero to moderate temperatures, but put special emphasis on the phase structure of matter at zero temperature and large baryon densities. The calculation of the free energy involves the solution of gap equations. This is achieved by transforming these gap equations into ordinary differential equations that control the flow with increasing baryon density of various physical quantities: the isoscalar condensate, the densities of protons and neutrons, as well as those of their respective chiral partners. In this formulation, the initial conditions for the differential equations determine the entire phase structure. It is further demonstrated that the threshold for the onset of the population of the chiral partners is exclusively determined by the fermionic parameters, most notably by the chiral-invariant mass of the nucleon. We underline the role of a parity symmetry energy in driving the equilibration of the nucleons and their parity partners across the chiral transition. We provide a detailed analysis of the changes in the matter properties as one varies the neutron excess, including a special discussion of the chiral limit, and we compare systematically the parity-doublet model to its corresponding singlet model, where the chiral partner of the nucleon is neglected. Finally, we focus on neutron matter and compute the equation of state and the speed of sound. The results are confronted to those of other calculations as well as to recent Bayesian analyses of neutron-star observations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss medium effects on light cluster production in the QCD phase diagram by relating Mott transition lines to those for chemical freeze-out. In heavy-ion collisions at highest energies provided by the LHC, light cluster abundances should follow the statistical model because of low baryon densities. Chemical freeze-out in this domain is correlated with the QCD crossover transition. At low energies, in the nuclear fragmentation region, where the freeze-out interferes with the liquid-gas phase transition, self-energy and Pauli blocking effects are important. We demonstrate that at intermediate energies the chemical freeze-out line correlates with the maximum mass fraction of nuclear bound states, in particular $\alpha$ particles. In this domain, the HADES, FAIR and NICA experiments can give new insights.</description>

      <title>Hyperons during proto-neutron star deleptonization and the emission of dark flavored particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complementary to high-energy experimental efforts, indirect astrophysical searches of particles beyond the standard model have long been pursued. The present article follows the latter approach and considers, for the first time, the self-consistent treatment of the energy losses from dark flavored particles produced in the decay of hyperons during a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). To this end, general relativistic supernova simulations in spherical symmetry are performed, featuring six-species Boltzmann neutrino transport, and covering the long-term evolution of the nascent remnant proto-neutron star (PNS) deleptonization for several tens of seconds. A well-calibrated hyperon equation of state (EOS) is therefore implemented into the supernova simulations and tested against the corresponding nucleonic model. It is found that supernova observables, such as the neutrino signal, are robustly insensitive to the appearance of hyperons for the simulation times considered in the present study. The presence of hyperons enables an additional channel for the appearance of dark sector particles, which is considered at the level of the $\Lambda$ hyperon decay. Assuming massless particles that escape the PNS after being produced, these channels expedite the deleptonizing PNS and the cooling behaviour. This, in turn, shortens the neutrino emission timescale. The present study confirms the previously estimated upper limits on the corresponding branching ratios for low and high mass PNS, by effectively reducing the neutrino emission timescale by a factor of two. This is consistent with the classical argument deduced from the neutrino detection associated with SN1987A.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Composite Operators in the $\phi^4$ Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Inflation, Reheating and Dark Radiation in a IIB perturbative moduli stabilization scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cosmological implications of an effective field theory model derived within a configuration of D7 brane stacks in the framework of type-IIB string theory. We consider a suitable geometric setup where the K\"ahler moduli fields are stabilized and the parametric space is constrained so that a de Sitter vacuum is ensured. In addition to the moduli fields we also take into account the usual Higgs and matter fields included in the effective field theory. In this background, we implement the standard hybrid inflation scenario with a singlet scalar field acting as the inflaton and the Higgs states serving as waterfall fields. Radiative corrections and soft supersymmetry breaking terms play an essential role in the realization of a successful inflationary scenario consistent with the present cosmological data. Small tensor-to-scalar ratio values are predicted, which can be probed in future planned experiments. Further constraints on the model's parameters are derived from bounds on dark radiation which is measured as a contribution to the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$. In particular, we find an excess of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\leq{0.95}$ at $2\sigma$ confidence level with natural values of the involved couplings.</description>

      <title>Earth tomography with supernova neutrinos at future neutrino detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth neutrino tomography is a realistic possibility with current and future neutrino detectors, complementary to geophysics methods. The two main approaches are based on either partial absorption of the neutrino flux as it propagates through the Earth (at energies about a few TeV) or on coherent Earth matter effects affecting the neutrino oscillations pattern (at energies below a few tens of GeV). In this work, we consider the latter approach focusing on supernova neutrinos with tens of MeV. Whereas at GeV energies, Earth matter effects are driven by the atmospheric mass-squared difference, at energies below $\sim 100$ MeV, it is the solar mass-squared difference what controls them. Unlike solar neutrinos, which suffer from significant weakening of the contribution to the oscillatory effect from remote structures due to the neutrino energy reconstruction capabilities of detectors, supernova neutrinos can have higher energies and thus, can better probe the Earth's interior. We shall revisit this possibility, using the most recent neutrino oscillation parameters and up-to-date supernova neutrino spectra. The capabilities of future neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande and JUNO are presented, including the impact of the energy resolution and other factors. Assuming a supernova burst at 10~kpc, we show that the average Earth's core density could be determined within $\lesssim 10\%$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, being Hyper-Kamiokande, with its largest mass, the most promising detector to achieve this goal.</description>

      <title>An effective gauge field theory of the nucleon interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of constructing an effective gauge field theory of the nucleon interations based on the ideas of isotopic invariance as well as hypercharge invariance as a local gauge symmetry and spontaneous breaking of this symmetry. The constructed model predicts the structure of interactions of protons and neutrons with $\rho$- and $\sigma$-mesons, with pi-mesons and photons, as well as interactions of these particles with each other. The Lagrangian of the model consists of several parts parts involving dimension 4 and 5 gauge invariant operators. Feynman rules for physical degrees of freedom as follow from the Lagrangian define the structure of diagrams for one-boson exchanges between nucleons predicting the internucleon one-boson exchange potential as well as nucleon scattering amplitudes. The range of applicability of the model is discussed and estimates are made of the resulting coupling constants. The model predicts the mass of the neutral $\rho^0$-meson to be about $1\,MeV$ larger than the mass of the charged mesons $\rho^{\pm}$. The vector $\omega$-meson, which is a sterile particle with respect to the considered gauge group $SU_I(2)\times U_Y(1)$, can be added to the scheme by means of a gauge-invariant operator of dimension 5, as shown in Appendix ~A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The available world deep-inelastic scattering data on proton and deuteron structure functions F2p, F2d, and their ratios, are leveraged to extract the free neutron F2n structure function, the F2n/F2p ratio, and associated uncertainties using the latest nuclear effect calculations in the deuteron. Special attention is devoted to the normalization of the proton and deuteron experimental datasets and to the treatment of correlated systematic errors, as well as the quantification of procedural and theoretical uncertainties. The extracted F2n dataset is utilized to evaluate the Q2 dependence of the Gottfried sum rule and the nonsinglet F2p - F2n moments. To facilitate replication of our study, as well as for general applications, a comprehensive DIS database including all recent JLab 6 GeV measurements, the extracted F2n, a modified CTEQ-JLab global PDF fit named CJ15nlo_mod, and grids with calculated proton, neutron and deuteron DIS structure functions at next-to-leading order, are discussed and made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay without Vacuum Majorana Neutrino Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-concept extension to the Standard Model that can generate a non-vanishing neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) signal without the existence of Majorana neutrinos or lepton number violation in the zero-density vacuum-ground-state Lagrangian. We propose that the $0\nu\beta\beta$ can be induced by the capture of an ultralight scalar field, a potential dark matter candidate, that carries two units of lepton number. This makes the observable $0\nu\beta\beta$ spectrum indistinguishable from the usual $0\nu\beta\beta$ mechanisms by any practical means. We find that a non-zero $0\nu\beta\beta$ rate does not require neutrinos to be fundamentally Majorana particles. However, for sizeable decay rates within the range of next-generation experiments, the neutrino will, generally, acquire an (effective) Majorana mass as the scalar field undergoes a transition to the Bose-Einstein condensate phase. We also discuss the distinction between the aforementioned scenario and the case in which the emission of a lepton-number-two scalar leads to $0\nu\beta\beta$, exhibiting discernible qualitative features that make it experimentally distinguishable from the conventional scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analytic calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order $\text{QCD} \otimes \text{EW}$ corrections to $Z$-boson pair production at electron-positron colliders. The two-loop master integrals essential to this calculation are evaluated using the differential equation method. In this work, we detail the formulation and solution of the canonical differential equations for the two-loop three-point master integrals with two on-shell $Z$-boson external legs and a massive internal quark in the loops. These canonical master integrals are systematically expanded as Taylor series in the dimensional regulator, $\epsilon = (4-d)/2$, up to the order of $\epsilon^4$, with coefficients expressed in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms up to weight four. Upon applying our analytic expressions of these master integrals to the phenomenological analysis of $Z$-pair production, we observe that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha \alpha_s)$ corrections manifest at a level of approximately one percent compared to the leading-order predictions, underscoring their significance for comparisons with future high-precision experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a mirror twin Higgs model with spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking that ameliorates the constraints in twin Higgs cosmology and, at the same time, generates the Standard Model neutrino masses. The model features an $SU(2)$ triplet with hypercharge $1$ alongside its twin counterpart. Spontaneous breaking of both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and electroweak symmetry occurs in the scalar sector. The Standard Model neutrinos acquire small masses through the type-II seesaw mechanism. In contrast, their twin counterparts acquire large masses, effectively addressing the dark radiation problem in mirror twin Higgs scenarios. We study the impact of the model on the $N_{\rm eff.}$ constraints, as well as on collider phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel semi-analytical method for parton evolution. It is based on constructing a family of analytic functions spanning $x$-space which is closed under the considered evolution equation. Using these functions as a basis, the original integro-differential evolution equation transforms into a system of coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved numerically by restriction to a suitably chosen finite subsystem. The evolved distributions are obtained as analytic functions in $x$ with numerically obtained coefficients, providing insight into the analytic behavior of the evolved parton distributions. As a proof-of-principle, we apply our method to the leading order non-singlet and singlet DGLAP equation. Comparing our results to traditional Mellin-space methods, we find good agreement. The method is implemented in the code $\texttt{POMPOM}$ in $\texttt{Mathematica}$ as well as in $\texttt{Python}$.</description>

      <title>Soft-gluon exchange matters: isotropic screening in QCD kinetic theory</title>

Abstract: QCD kinetic theory simulations are a prominent tool for studying the nonequilibrium initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Despite their success, all implementations rely on approximations of the hard thermal loop (HTL) screened matrix elements in the collision terms. In this paper, we present our results for different isotropic screening prescriptions in the elastic collision term for gluons. In particular, we go beyond the simple Debye-like screening form that is used in all current implementations and apply the isotropic HTL matrix element instead. For isotropic systems, the evolution is nearly unchanged, but when studying the equilibration process in a Bjorken expanding plasma, we find qualitative and quantitative differences in a range of moments of the distribution function, such as a decrease in the maximum pressure anisotropy by up to 50%. In contrast, we find no significant qualitative impact on the jet quenching parameter or on the late-time hydrodynamization dynamics of anisotropic plasmas but observe systematically smaller values of $\eta/s$ by about 10% that coincide with perturbative calculations at small couplings. Our study reveals that the choice of the screening prescription can lead to large corrections at early times, but is less important close to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Cold nuclear matter effects on azimuthal decorrelation in heavy-ion collisions</title>

Abstract: The assumption of factorization lies at the core of calculations of medium effects on observables computable in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. In this work we examine this assumption, for which we propose a setup to study hard processes and bulk nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions on the same footing using the Glauber modelling of heavy nuclei. To exemplify this approach, we calculate the leading-order corrections to azimuthal decorrelation in Drell-Yan and boson-jet processes due to cold nuclear matter effects, not considering radiation. At leading order in both the hard momentum scale and the nuclear size, the impact-parameter dependent cross section is found to factorize for both processes. The factorization formula involves a convolution of the hard cross section with the medium-modified parton distributions, and, for boson-jet production, the medium-modified jet function.</description>

      <title>On s-confining SUSY-QCD with Anomaly Mediation</title>

Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the phase diagram of supersymmetric QCD with $N_{f}=N_{c}+1$ flavors perturbed by Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB). We extend the previous analyses on s-confining ASQCD theories in three different directions. We show that the existence of the QCD-like vacuum is independent of the size of the SUSY breaking parameter. We further expand the analysis of these models by including two and three-loop contributions to investigate the robustness and limitations of the results. Finally, we include the leading effect of higher-order K\"ahler terms to investigate the stability of the phase diagram as we approach the confining energy scale. The analysis with higher order K\"ahler terms is also extended for $N_{c}=2$ for which AMSB alone gives inconclusive results.</description>

      <title>Black Hole from Entropy Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One quantum characterization of a black hole motivated by (local) holography and thermodynamics is that it maximizes thermodynamic entropy for a given surface area. In the context of quantum gravity, this could be more fundamental than the classical characterization by a horizon. As a step, we explore this possibility by solving the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation with many matter fields, and find a picture of a black hole. For spherical static highly-excited configurations, we apply local typicality and estimate the entropy including self-gravity to derive its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely determines the entropy-maximized configuration: self-gravitating quanta condensate into a radially-uniform dense configuration with no horizon, where the self-gravity and a large quantum pressure induced by the curvatures are balanced and no singularity appears. The interior metric is a self-consistent and non-perturbative solution for Planck's constant. The maximum entropy, given by the volume integral of the entropy density, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula through self-gravity, deriving the Bousso bound for thermodynamic entropy. Finally, 10 future prospects are discussed, leading to the speculative view that the configuration represents semi-classically a quantum-gravitational condensate with holographic bulk dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and electron-positron ($e^{+}e^{-}$) pair photoproduction in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions are reported by the STAR experiment at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}=200~\rm{GeV}$. We report several first measurements at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, which are i) $J/\psi$ photoproduction with large momentum transfer up to $2.2~\rm{(GeV/c)^{2}}$, ii) coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction associated with neutron emissions from nuclear breakup, iii) the rapidity dependence of incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction, iv) the $\psi(2s)$ photoproduction cross section at mid-rapidity, and v) $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair photoproduction up to high invariant mass of 6 $\rm{GeV/c^2}$. For measurement ii), the coherent $J/\psi$ total cross section of $\gamma^{\ast} + \rm{Au} \rightarrow J/\psi + \rm{Au}$ as a function of the center-of-mass energy $W_{\rm{\gamma* N}}$ has been obtained without photon energy ambiguities. The data are quantitatively compared with the Monte Carlo models STARlight, Sartre, BeAGLE, and theoretical calculations of gluon saturation with color glass condensate, nuclear shadowing with leading twist approximation, Quantum Electrodynamics, and the Next-to-Leading Order perturbative QCD. At the photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 25.0 GeV, the coherent and incoherent $J/\psi$ cross sections of Au nuclei are found to be $71\pm10\%$ and $36\pm7\%$, respectively, of that of free protons. These data provide an important experimental constraint for nuclear parton distribution functions and a unique opportunity to advance the understanding of the nuclear modification effect at the top RHIC energy.</description>

      <title>Observation of strong nuclear suppression in exclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions at RHIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a measurement of exclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV using the STAR detector. For the first time, i) the rapidity correlation between $J/\psi$ photoproduction and neutron emission from nuclear breakups has been experimentally measured; ii) nuclear suppression factors are measured for both the coherent and incoherent $J/\psi$ production. At photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 25.0 GeV, the coherent and incoherent $J/\psi$ cross sections of Au nuclei are found to be $71\pm10\%$ and $36\pm7\%$, respectively, of that of free protons. The stronger suppression observed in the incoherent production provides a new experimental handle to study the initial-state parton density in heavy nuclei. Data are compared with theoretical models quantitatively.</description>

Abstract: Wilson's renormalization-group approach to the weakly-interacting single-component Bose gas is discussed within the symmetry-broken, condensate phase. Extending upon the work by Bijlsma and Stoof [Phys. Rev. A 54, 5085 (1996), see http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.54.5085 ], wave-function renormalization of the temporal derivative contributions to the effective action is included in order to capture sound-like quasiparticle excitations with wave lengths larger than the healing-length scale. By means of a suitable rescaling scheme we achieve convergence of the coupling flows, which serve as a means to determine the condensate depletion in accordance with Bogoliubov theory, as well as the interaction-induced shift of the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Curvature of the chiral phase transition line from the magnetic equation of state of (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dependence of the chiral phase transition temperature on baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials by calculating the leading order curvature coefficients in the light and strange quark flavor basis as well as in the conserved charge ($B, S$) basis. Making use of scaling properties of the magnetic equation of state (MEoS) and including diagonal as well as off-diagonal contributions in the expansion of the energy-like scaling variable that enters the parametrization of the MEoS, allows to explore the variation of $T_c(\mu_B,\mu_S) = T_c ( 1 - (\kappa_2^B \hat{\mu}_B^2 + \kappa_2^S \hat{\mu}_S^2 + 2\kappa_{11}^{BS} \hat{\mu}_B \hat{\mu}_S))$ along different lines in the $(\mu_B,\mu_S)$ plane. On lattices with fixed cut-off in units of temperature, $aT=1/8$, we find $\kappa_2^B=0.015(1)$, $\kappa_2^S=0.0124(5)$ and $\kappa_{11}^{BS}=-0.0050(7)$. We show that the chemical potential dependence along the line of vanishing strangeness chemical potential is about 10\% larger than along the strangeness neutral line. The latter differs only by about $3\%$ from the curvature on a line of vanishing strange quark chemical potential, $\mu_s=0$. We also show that close to the chiral limit the strange quark mass contributes like an energy-like variable in scaling relations for pseudo-critical temperatures. The chiral phase transition temperature decreases with decreasing strange quark mass, $T_c(m_s)= T_c(m_s^{\rm phy}) (1 - 0.097(2) (m_s-m_s^{\rm phys})/m_s^{\rm phy}+{\cal O}((\Delta m_s)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Decoherence in Neutrino Oscillation at the ESSnuSB Experiment</title>

Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments provide a unique window in exploring several new physics scenarios beyond the standard three flavour. One such scenario is quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillation which tends to destroy the interference pattern of neutrinos reaching the far detector from the source. In this work, we study the decoherence in neutrino oscillation in the context of the ESSnuSB experiment. We consider the energy-independent decoherence parameter and derive the analytical expressions for P$_{\mu e}$ and P$_{\mu \mu}$ probabilities in vacuum. We have computed the capability of ESSnuSB to put bounds on the decoherence parameters namely, $\Gamma_{21}$ and $\Gamma_{32}$ and found that the constraints on $\Gamma_{21}$ are competitive compared to the DUNE bounds and better than the most stringent LBL ones from MINOS/MINOS+. We have also investigated the impact of decoherence on the ESSnuSB measurement of the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$ and concluded that it remains robust in the presence of new physics.</description>
