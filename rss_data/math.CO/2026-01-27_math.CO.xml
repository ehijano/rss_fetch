      <title>Complexity of the Feedback Vertex Set Problem in Tournaments with Forbidden Subtournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the complexity of the minimum feedback vertex set problem (MFBVS) for tournaments with forbidden subtournaments. The MFBVS problem in general tournaments is known to be NP-complete. We prove that the MFBVS problem for $W_5$-free and $U_5$-free tournaments is in P, and for $T_5$-free tournaments it remains NP-complete. Moreover, we prove a necessary condition for all $H$ such that the MFBVS problem for $H$-free tournaments is in P. We also show that the necessary condition is not sufficient.</description>

      <title>Some Families of Type $B$ Set Partitions Counted by the Dowling Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study type $B$ set partitions without zero block.
  Certain classes of these partitions, such as merging-free and separated
  partitions (enumerated by the Dowling numbers), are investigated.
  We show that these classes are in bijection with type $B$ set partitions.
  The intersection of these two classes is also studied, and we prove that their block-generating polynomials
  are real-rooted.
  Finally, we study the descent statistics on the class of permutations obtained by flattening type $B$ merging-free partitions. Using the valley-hopping action,
  we prove the Gamma-positivity of the descent
  distribution and provide a combinatorial interpretation of the Gamma-coefficients.
  We also show that the descent statistic is homomesic under valley-hopping.</description>

      <title>Non-Hamiltonian 2-regular Digraphs -- Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier papers, we showed a decomposition of the arcs of 2-diregular digraphs (2-dds) and used it to prove some conditions for these graphs to be non-Hamiltonian; we then extended this decomposition to a larger class of digraphs and used it to construct infinite families of (strongly) connected non-Hamiltonian 2-dds and provided techniques to establish non-Hamiltonicity in special cases. In the present paper, for a subclass of these graphs, we show connections between non-Hamiltonicity and sets of permutations in the full symmetric group S(n) by introducing the concepts of biconjugates, excluded sets and residues; we then use these concepts to prove a necessary and sufficient condition for non-Hamiltonicity.</description>

      <title>The size of $k$-th order generalized Fibonacci cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\geq2$. Then the $k$-th order Fibonacci cube $\Gamma^{(k)}_{n}$ is the subgraph of the hypercube $Q_{n}$ induced by vertices without $k$ consecutive $1$s. The case $k=2$ corresponds to the classic Fibonacci cube $\Gamma_{n}$. There are three kinds of calculation formulas of the size of $\Gamma_{n}$: the iteration form $|E(\Gamma_{n})|=|E(\Gamma_{n-1})|+|E(\Gamma_{n-2})|+F_{n}$ (Hsu, 1993), %iteration form the convolution form $|E(\Gamma_{n})|=\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i=1}^{n}F_{i}F_{n-i+1}$ (Klav\v{z}ar, 2005) %convolution form and the linear form $|E(\Gamma_{n})|=\frac{nF_{n+1}+2(n+1)F_{n}}{5}$ (Munarini et al., 2001). %linear form Belbachir and Ould-Mohamed (2020) studied the iteration and convolution formulas of the size of $\Gamma^{(3)}_{n}$. Very recently, Mollard (2025) deduced the iteration formula of the size of $\Gamma^{(k)}_{n}$ for $k\geq2$. In this paper, we give the the formulas of convolution and linear forms of $|E(\Gamma^{(k)}_{n})|$ for all $k\geq2$. Specifically, we obtain the formula of $|E(\Gamma^{(k)}_{n})|$ in terms of convolved $k$-th order Fibonacci numbers and the formula of $|E(\Gamma^{(k)}_{n})|$ of linear expression of $k$ consecutive $k$-th order Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>Constructing spherical designs using tight $t$-fusion frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study conditions under which a finite subset $Z$ of the unit sphere $S^{d-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ becomes a spherical $t$-design, when $Z$ is constructed by the following procedure: starting from a finite set of $k$-dimensional subspaces in the real Grassmannian $G_{k,d}$, we place, for each such $k$-dimensional subspace, a finite set on its unit sphere, and then take the union of these sets in $S^{d-1}$. For this construction problem -- namely, obtaining spherical designs in higher dimensions by distributing point sets on lower-dimensional spheres subspace by subspace -- we provide a sufficient condition based on the framework of tight $t$-fusion frames ($\mathrm{TFF}_t$) due to Bachoc--Ehler. As a preparation for applications, we moreover give an explicit construction of equal-weight tight $2$-fusion frames on $G_{2,d}$ for infinitely many dimensions $d$, via unions of orbits of the hyperoctahedral group. We also derive necessary conditions for the existence of highly symmetric tight $t$-fusion frames, namely equi-chordal and equi-isoclinic tight $t$-fusion frames ($\mathrm{ECTFF}_t$ and $\mathrm{EITFF}_t$), on $G_{2,d}$, and in particular obtain bounds on the number of points.</description>

      <title>Equivariant inverse $Z$-polynomials of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion of the inverse $Z$-polynomial introduced by Ferroni, Matherne, Stevens, and Vecchi, we study the equivariant inverse $Z$-polynomial of a matroid equipped with a finite group. We prove that the coefficients of the equivariant inverse $Z$-polynomials are honest representations and that these polynomials are palindromic. Explicit formulas are obtained for uniform matroids equipped with the symmetric group. The corresponding formulas for $q$-niform matroids are derived using the Comparison Theorem for unipotent representations. For arbitrary equivariant paving matroids, explicit expressions are obtained by relating the polynomials of a matroid to those of its relaxation. We show that these polynomials are equivariantly unimodal and strongly inductively log-concave for both uniform and $q$-niform matroids. Motivated by the properties of equivariant $Z$-polynomials, we conjecture that the coefficients of the equivariant inverse $Z$-polynomials are equivariantly unimodal and strongly equivariantly log-concave.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Linear Tur\'{a}n Number for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph $H$ is said to be \emph{linear} if every pair of vertices lies in at most one hyperedge. Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs, an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ is \emph{$\mathcal{F}$-free} if it contains no member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subhypergraph. The \emph{linear Tur\'{a}n number} $ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of hyperedges in an $\mathcal{F}$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices.
  Gy\'arf\'as, Ruszink\'o, and S\'ark\"ozy~[\emph{Linear Tur\'an numbers of acyclic triple systems}, European J.\ Combin.\ (2022)] initiated the study of bounds on the linear Tur\'an number for acyclic $3$-uniform linear hypergraphs.
  In this paper, we extend the study of linear Tur\'{a}n number for acyclic systems to higher uniformity. We first give a construction for any linear $r$-uniform tree with $k$ edges that yields the lower bound $ ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,T_k^r)\ge {n(k-1)}/{r}, $ under mild divisibility and existence assumptions. Next, we study hypertrees with four edges. We prove the exact bound $ ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,B_4^r)\le {(r+1)n}/{r} $ and characterize the extremal hypergraph class, where $B_4^r$ is formed from $S_3^r$ by appending a hyperedge incident to a degree-one vertex. We also prove the bound $ ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,E_4^r)\le {(2r-1)n}/{r} $ for the crown $E_4^r$. Finally, we give a construction showing $ ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,P_4^r)\ge {(r+1)n}/{r} $ under suitable assumptions and conclude with a conjecture on sharp upper bound for $P_4^r$.</description>

      <title>An identity relating $n$-nacci numbers, partitions, and products of binomial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the combinatorial properties of final types, which are certain non-decreasing sequences of integers, together with the partitions naturally associated with them. As a consequence, we obtain an identity expressing the $n$-nacci numbers as sums of products of binomial coefficients over these partitions, generalizing the classical identity for $n = 2$ that expresses Fibonacci numbers in this way. We also examine how the partial order on the set of all partitions of a fixed integer induced by the ordering of final types compares with two natural partial orders on the same set.</description>

      <title>Black Cell Capacity in Catalan polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Catalan word is a sequence $w_1w_2\cdots w_n$ of nonnegative integers such that $w_1=0$ and $w_{i}\leq w_{i-1}+1$ for $2\leq i\leq n$. Given a Catalan word, we construct a column-convex polyomino (or \emph{bargraph}) by placing, at position $i$, a column of height $w_i + 1$, with all columns aligned along their bottom edges. On these Catalan polyominoes we define the black cell capacity by coloring the cells in a chessboard pattern and we count the number of black cells in the polyomino. We study the distribution of the black cell capacity over Catalan polyominoes and derive generating functions that encode this statistic.</description>

      <title>Manifold-based Proving Methods in Projective Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article compares different proving methods for projective incidence theorems. In particular, a technique using quadrilateral tilings recently introduced by Sergey Fomin and Pavlo Pylyavskyy is shown to be at most as strong as proofs using bi-quadratic final polynomials and thus, also proofs using Ceva-Menelaus-tilings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the equivalence between quadrilateral-tiling-proofs and proofs using exclusively Menelaus configurations. We exemplify the transition between the proofs in several examples in 2D and in 3D.</description>

      <title>The edge-isoperimetric number of graphs and their powers: approaches from spectral graph theory, optimization and finite geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain several sharp spectral bounds, approximations, and exact values for the isoperimetric number and related edge-expansion parameters of graphs. Our results focus on graph powers and on families of graphs with rich algebraic or geometric structure, including distance-regular graphs and graphs arising from finite geometries, among others. Our proofs use techniques from spectral graph theory, linear optimization, finite geometry, and probability, yielding new machinery for analysing edge-expansion phenomena in highly structured graphs.</description>

      <title>An approximate version of Brouwer's Laplacian conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be an $n$-vertex graph, $L(G)\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ its Laplacian matrix, and let $\lambda_1(L(G))\ge \lambda_2(L(G))\ge \cdots\ge \lambda_n(L(G))=0$ denote its eigenvalues. For $1\le k\le n$, let $\varepsilon_k(G)= \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L(G)) -|E|$. We show that for every $1\le k\le n$, \[
  \varepsilon_k(G) \le \max_{U\subset V,\, |U|=k} |E_G(U)| + (4k-2)\sqrt{k}, \] where $E_G(U)$ is the set of edges of $G$ contained in $U$. As an immediate consequence, we obtain that $\varepsilon_k(G)\le \binom{k}{2}+(4k-2)\sqrt{k}$. This improves upon previously known bounds for large values of $k$, and may be seen as an approximate version of a conjecture of Brouwer, stating that $\varepsilon_k(G)\le \binom{k+1}{2}$ for every graph $G$. Moreover, for every $r\ge 2$, if $G$ is a $K_{r+1}$-free graph, we obtain that $\varepsilon_k(G)\le (1-1/r)k^2/2 + (4k-2)\sqrt{k}$, which is tight up to the sub-quadratic term.
  Our arguments rely on the study of the largest eigenvalue of a matrix obtained by performing a certain diagonal perturbation on the $k$-th additive compound matrix of $L(G)$. Using similar methods, we show that the largest Laplacian eigenvalue of the $k$-th token graph of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is bounded from above by $|E|+4k-2$, obtaining a weak version of a conjecture of Apte, Parekh, and Sud, which predicts that an upper bound of $|E|+k$ should hold. All our results also hold, with essentially the same proofs, when the Laplacian matrix is replaced by the signless Laplacian of the graph.</description>

      <title>Discrete Moving Frames, Semi-Algebraic Invariants and the Graph Canonization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an invariant--geometric interpretation of the canonization problem for simple undirected weighted graphs based on the {discrete moving frame method} for finite groups. We consider the action of the {pair group} $S_n^{(2)}$ on the space of edge weights of a graph. It is emphasized that the classical algebraic approach aimed at describing the ring of polynomial invariants of this action quickly becomes computationally impractical due to the explosive growth in the number and degrees of generators. The main result is a formalization of a canonical labeling of a graph as a {discrete moving frame} in the sense of Olver: a discrete orbit cross-section is fixed, in particular by a lexicographic rule, and for each configuration of edge weights one defines a permutation in $S_n^{(2)}$ that maps it to its canonical representative. The coordinates of the canonical representative are interpreted as a {complete system of invariants} for the action of $S_n^{(2)}$ that separates orbits, i.e., isomorphism classes of graphs. It is shown that the invariants obtained via such orbit canonization are of a non-algebraic nature and belong to the class of {semi-algebraic functions}. We do not propose a new computational algorithm; instead, we provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the very concept of canonization by viewing it as a process of constructing a discrete moving frame and the corresponding system of semi-algebraic invariants.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of the generating function of semistandard oscillating tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H.Choi-D.Kim-S.J.Lee and S.J.Lee introduced a new kind of tableaux, semistandard oscillating tableaux (SSOT), around 2024 in the context of Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities, KR crystals and King tableaux. In this paper, we study generating function of the SSOTs and its symmetry. First, we extend Gessel's and Assaf-Searles' expansion of a Schur function in terms of fundamental quasi-symmetric functions to our generating function. As a consequence, we show that it is $F$-positive. Further, we improve Sundaram's work on oscillating tableaux by proving that it is symmetric, Schur-positive, and has Saturated Newton polytope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DeVos et al conjectured that if $M$ is a simple, regular matroid and $c$ is a colouring of the elements of $M$ with $r(M)+1$ colours, where each colour class has at least two elements, then $M$ contains a rainbow circuit of size at most $\lceil \frac {r(M)+1}2 \rceil.$ We prove this conjecture by showing that for all such regular matroids there are four rainbow circuits $C_i,\ i = 1,2,3,4$ for which $\sum_i |C_i| \le 2r(M) +4$ and for which no element of $M$ belongs to more than two of the circuits.</description>

      <title>Signless Laplacian spectral conditions: Forbidden $4$-cycle and star embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signless Laplacian spectral radius has emerged as a crucial spectral parameter in network science. This paper establishes new extremal results in spectral graph theory by investigating the signless Laplacian spectral radius ($Q$-index) of graphs with forbidden subgraphs. We present a $Q$-spectral analog of classical Nosal-type theorems, providing sharp conditions that guarantee the existence of either a $4$-cycle or a large star $K_{1,m-k}$ in a graph. The main theorem states that for integers $k \geq 0$ and graphs $G$ with size $m \geq \max\{7k+31, k^2+8(k+1)\}$, if $q(G) \geq q(S^+_{m,k+1})$, then $G$ must contain a $4$-cycle or $K_{1,m-k}$, unless $G$ is isomorphic to the extremal graph $S^+_{m,k+1}$ formed by adding $k+1$ independent edges to the star $K_{1,m-k-1}$. This result refines previous work on star embeddings by Wang and Guo [Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics, 59 (2024) 213--224], and completes the $Q$-spectral counterpart to Wang's adjacency spectral theorem for $4$-cycle containment [Discrete Math., 345 (2022) 112973]. Our analysis reveals new insights into how signless Laplacian eigenvalues encode graph structure, with tight bounds demonstrated through explicit extremal graph constructions and asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <title>Transversal and Hamiltonicity in a bipartite graph collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{G}=\{G_1,\dots,G_{2n-1}\}$ be a collection of $2n-1$ bipartite graphs on the same bipartition $V=(X,Y)$ with $|X|=|Y|=n$. For a path $P$ with $V(P)=V$ and $|E(P)|=2n-1$, if there exists an injection $\phi$: $E(P)\rightarrow [2n-1]$ such that $e\in E(G_{\phi(e)})$ for each $e\in E(P)$, then we say that $P$ is a $\mathbf{G}$-transversal isomorphic to a Hamiltonian path. A bipartite graph collection $\mathbf{G}$ is called Hamiltonian connected if for any two vertices $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$, there exists a $\mathbf{G}$-transversal isomorphic to a Hamiltonian path between $x$ and $y$. In this paper, we give the minimum degree conditions to ensure the existence of a $\mathbf{G}$-transversal isomorphic to a Hamiltonian path and the Hamiltonian connectivity of $\mathbf{G}$, which improve the results of [Hu, Li, Li and Xu, Discrete Math., 2024.]</description>

      <title>On asymptotically tight bounds for the open conflict-free chromatic indexes of nearly regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge colouring $c$ of a graph $G$ is called conflic-free if every non-isolated edge of $G$ has a uniquely coloured neighbour in its open edge neighbourhood. The least number of colours admitting such a colouring is denoted by $\chi'_{\rm OCF}(G)$, or $\chi'_{\rm pOCF}(G)$ if we additionally require $c$ to be proper.
  Our main result implies in particular that $\chi'_{\rm OCF}(G) \le \log_2 \Delta + O(\ln\ln\Delta)$ for nearly regular graphs $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, which is asymptotically optimal, as witnessed by the complete graphs. For proper colourings, we moreover show that $\chi'_{\rm pOCF}(G) \le \Delta + O(\ln \Delta)$ in the same regime. These results improve existing bounds stemming from related colouring models and transfer directly to random graphs' setting.
  The proofs combine decomposition techniques with probabilistic arguments and structural properties of edge neighbourhoods.</description>

      <title>On Lines Crossing Pairwise Intersecting Convex Sets in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1913 Helly's theorem states that any family ${\cal K}$ of $n\geq d+1$ convex sets in ${\mathbb R}^d$ can be pierced by a single point if and only if any $d+1$ of ${\cal K}$'s elements can. In 2002 Alon, Kalai, Matou\v{s}ek and Meshulam ruled out the possibility of similar criteria for the existence of lines crossing multiple convex sets in dimension $d\geq 3$ -- for any $k\geq 3$, they described arbitrary large families ${\cal K}$ of convex sets in ${\mathbb R}^3$ so that any $k$ elements of ${\cal K}$ can be crossed by a line yet no $k+4$ of them can.
  Let ${\cal K}$ be a family of $n$ pairwise intersecting convex sets in ${\mathbb R}^3$. We show that there exists a line crossing $\Theta(n)$ elements of ${\cal K}$. This resolves the most extensively studied variant of a problem by Mart\'inez, Rold\'an-Pensado and Rubin (Discrete Comput. Geom. 2020) which was highlighted by B\'ar\'any and Kalai (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 2021). Our result adds to the very few sufficient (and non-trivial) conditions that have been known for the existence of line transversals to large families of convex sets.
  Our argument is based on a Ramsey-type result of independent interest for families of pairwise intersecting convex sets in ${\mathbb R}^2$, and the structure of line arrangements in ${\mathbb R}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider triangulations of closed $2$-dimensional (not necessarily orientable) surfaces. Any minimal set of zigzags that double covers the set of edges provides a $z$-orientation of the triangulation. We introduce Markov chains of $z$-oriented triangulations. Our main result is a characterization of their ergodicity. This topic is closely connected to coloring of Eulerian triangulations.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Eulerian Numbers via Semipermutations: Topological and Combinatorial Aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper by Lin an interesting family of semipermutations comes out to index the elements of a cohomology basis of a Hessenberg type variety. The corresponding Betti numbers are a generalization of Eulerian numbers. We show three different subsets of the symmetric group that are in bijection with the set of these semipermutations. These bijections preserve the statistics lec and des: one of these is obtained by an algebraic-topological argument, the others are explicitly described in combinatorial terms.</description>

      <title>On the area-depth symmetry on {\L}ukasiewicz paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an effort to further understanding $q,t$-Catalan statistics, a new statistic on Dyck paths called $\mathtt{depth}$ was proposed in Pappe, Paul and Schilling (2022) and was shown to be jointly equi-distributed with the well-known $\mathtt{area}$ statistics. In a recent preprint, Qu and Zhang (2025) generalized $\mathtt{depth}$ to so-called ``$\vec{k}$-Dyck paths''. They showed that $\mathtt{area}$ and $\mathtt{depth}$ are also jointly equi-distributed over such paths with a fixed multiset of up-steps and a given first up-step, and they conjectured that the same holds when also fixing the last up-step. In this short note, we settle this conjecture on the more general context of {\L}ukasiewicz paths by interpreting $\mathtt{area}$ and $\mathtt{depth}$ under the classical bijection between {\L}ukasiewicz paths and plane trees, through which the symmetry is transparent.</description>

      <title>Flow-based Extremal Mathematical Structure Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of extremal structures in mathematics requires navigating vast and nonconvex landscapes where analytical methods offer little guidance and brute-force search becomes intractable. We introduce FlowBoost, a closed-loop generative framework that learns to discover rare and extremal geometric structures by combining three components: (i) a geometry-aware conditional flow-matching model that learns to sample high-quality configurations, (ii) reward-guided policy optimization with action exploration that directly optimizes the generation process toward the objective while maintaining diversity, and (iii) stochastic local search for both training-data generation and final refinement. Unlike prior open-loop approaches, such as PatternBoost that retrains on filtered discrete samples, or AlphaEvolve which relies on frozen Large Language Models (LLMs) as evolutionary mutation operators, FlowBoost enforces geometric feasibility during sampling, and propagates reward signal directly into the generative model, closing the optimization loop and requiring much smaller training sets and shorter training times, and reducing the required outer-loop iterations by orders of magnitude, while eliminating dependence on LLMs. We demonstrate the framework on four geometric optimization problems: sphere packing in hypercubes, circle packing maximizing sum of radii, the Heilbronn triangle problem, and star discrepancy minimization. In several cases, FlowBoost discovers configurations that match or exceed the best known results. For circle packings, we improve the best known lower bounds, surpassing the LLM-based system AlphaEvolve while using substantially fewer computational resources.</description>

      <title>Remarks about Connection and Dirac matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection Laplacian L and the Dirac matrix D are both n x n matrices defined from a given finite simplicial complex G with n sets. In both cases, there is interlacing of the eigenvalues for subcomplexes. This gives general upper bounds of the eigenvalues both for L and D in terms of inclusion or intersection degrees. We conjecture that L always dominates both D and the inverse of L in a weak Loewner sense. In a second part we look at dynamical systems (G,T), where T is a simplicial map on G. Both L and D generalize to dynamical versions of L and D. The modified L is still unimodular with an explicit Green function inverse and modified Dirac part still comes from an exterior derivative d. We also review the Lefschetz fixed point theorem for a simplicial map T on a simplicial complex G which implies the Brouwer fixed point theorem: any simplicial map on a contractible finite abstract simplicial complex G has a fixed simplex.</description>

      <title>On Extending Type $B$ Parking Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Armstrong, Reiner, and Rhoades defined for all Weyl groups $W$ a natural representation of $W$ called the $W$-parking space. The type $B$ parking space is the representation $\mathbb{C}[(\mathbb{Z}/(2n+1)\mathbb{Z})^n]$ of the $n$th signed symmetric group. We consider more general representations of the form $\mathbb{C}[(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^n]$; we conjecture that this representation extends to the $(n+1)$th signed symmetric group for all $n$ and $m$. We prove this conjecture when $m = 3$ or when $n \leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Vertex degrees in grid graphs associated with 213-avoiding permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a permutation of size $n$, we consider its associated grid graph whose $i$th column has height equal to the $i$th entry, with vertical edges between consecutive levels and horizontal edges between equal levels in adjacent columns. We study global degree statistics of these graphs when the permutation is chosen from the Catalan avoidance class $\mathrm{Av}_n(213)$ (and, by reversal, also from $\mathrm{Av}_n(312)$).
  We first obtain an explicit closed form for the total number of horizontal edges summed over all permutations in $\mathrm{Av}_n(213)$. We then determine, for each degree $r\in\{1,2,3,4\}$, the total number of degree-$r$ vertices accumulated over the same class, yielding closed expressions in terms of central binomial coefficients and powers of four. The proofs rely on the Catalan decomposition induced by the position of the minimum entry, which leads to gluing identities and algebraic functional equations for ordinary generating functions, completed using global vertex and degree-sum identities.
  As a consequence, we derive asymptotic degree proportions for a uniform random permutation in $\mathrm{Av}_n(213)$: the distribution concentrates and the proportion of degree-$4$ vertices tends to $1$, with a deficit of order $n^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brualdi-Solheid problem asks which graph achieves the extremal (maximum or minimum) spectral radius for a given class of graphs. This paper addresses the Brualdi-Solheid problem for \( \mathcal{G}_{n,\beta} \), the family of graphs with order \( n \) and matching number \( \beta \), aiming to identify its spectrally minimal graphs i.e., those that minimize the spectral radius \(\rho(G)\).
  We introduce the novel concept of ``quasi-adjacency'' relation, developing a unified structural classification framework for trees in \(\mathcal{G}_{n,\beta}\), which clarifies structural properties and provides a constructive method to generate trees with fixed \(\beta\). By showing that all spectrally minimal graphs in \( \mathcal{G}_{n,\beta} \) are trees, we further narrow the search for extremal graphs. Additionally, we apply this framework to the representative cases \(\beta=2,3,4\), obtaining the minimizers by explicit structural formulas involving parameters related to \(n\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An imprimitive symmetric indecomposable association scheme of rank 5 is said to be Higmanian. A divisible design graph is a graph whose adjacency matrix is an incidence matrix of a symmetric divisible design. We establish conditions which guarantee that a union of some basis relations of a Higmanian association scheme is an edge set of a divisible design graph. Further, we show that several known families of divisible design graphs can be obtained as fusions of Higmanian association schemes. Finally, using our approach we construct new infinite families of divisible design graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, following the paper ``On the average hitting times of the squares of cycles,'' we provide an explicit formula for the average hitting times of a simple random walk on a directed graph with $N$ vertices, where the graph consists of a cycle with a single absorbing vertex at its center, using elementary methods. Also, we show that the average hitting times can be expressed in terms of the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saturation number $\text{sat}_r(n,\mathcal{F})$ is the minimum number of hyperedges in an $r$-uniform $\mathcal{F}$-saturated hypergraph on $n$ vertices. We determine this parameter for $3$-uniform Berge-$K_4$ hypergraphs, proving that $\text{sat}_3(n,\text{Berge-}K_4)=n$ for $n =5,7,8$ and $n\ge 96$, while $\text{sat}_3(6,\text{Berge-}K_4)=5$. This resolves a problem posed by English, Kritschgau, Nahvi, and Sprangel~\cite{EKNS2024} for large $n.$ Using a computer search, we classify all extremal hypergraphs for $5\le n\le 8.$ For $n\geq 96$, we further show the existence of many non-isomorphic extremal families. Our approach synthesizes structural insights with computational power.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic triangle-tilings in dense graphs without large independent sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two graphs $H$ and $G$, an $H$-tiling is a family of vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ in $G$. A perfect $H$-tiling covers all vertices of $G$. The Corradi-Hajnal theorem (1963) states that an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta(G)\ge 2n/3$ contains a perfect triangle-tiling. For an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with independence number $\alpha(G)=o(n)$, Balogh, Molla and Sharifzadeh (Random Structures &amp; Algorithms, 2016) showed that a minimum degree of $(\frac12+o(1))n$ forces a perfect triangle-tiling. In a 2-edge-colored graph, Balogh, Freschi, Treglown (European J. Combin. 2026) determined the (asymptotic) minimum degree threshold for forcing a strong or weak monochromatic triangle-tiling covering a prescribed proportion of the vertices: a strong tiling requires all triangles to be in the same color class, while a weak tiling only requires each triangle to be monochromatic. In this paper, we combine the conditions from these two lines of work and prove that every $2$-edge-colored $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)=o(n)$ contains a weak monochromatic triangle-tiling $\Gamma$ of size \[ |\Gamma|\ge \begin{cases} 2\delta(G)-n-o(n), &amp; \text{if }\frac12 n\le \delta(G)\le \frac35 n,\\[2mm] \delta(G)/3-o(n), &amp; \text{if }\delta(G)&gt;\frac35 n. \end{cases} \] Both bounds are asymptotically optimal. We use the degree form regularity lemma in our proof.</description>

      <title>Well-quasi-ordered classes of bounded clique-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classes of graphs with bounded clique-width that are well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation, in the presence of labels on the vertices. We prove that, given a finite presentation of a class of graphs, one can decide whether the class is labelled-well-quasi-ordered. This solves an open problem raised by Daligault, Rao and Thomass\'e in 2010, and answers positively to two conjectures of Pouzet in the restricted case of bounded clique-width classes. Namely, we prove that being labelled-well-quasi-ordered by a set of size 2 or by a well-quasi-ordered infinite set are equivalent conditions, and that in such cases, one can freely assume that the graphs are equipped with a total ordering on their vertices. Finally, we provide a structural characterization of those classes as those that are of bounded clique-width and do not existentially transduce the class of all finite paths.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Graphs by Counting Homomorphisms from Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lov\'asz (1967) showed that two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if, and only if, they are homomorphism indistinguishable over all graphs, i.e., $G$ and $H$ admit the same number of number of homomorphisms from every graph $F$. Subsequently, a substantial line of work studied homomorphism indistinguishability over restricted graph classes. For example, homomorphism indistinguishability over minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{F}$ such as the class of planar graphs, the class of graphs of treewidth $\leq k$, pathwidth $\leq k$, or treedepth $\leq k$, was shown to be equivalent to quantum isomorphism and equivalences with respect to counting logic fragments, respectively.
  Via such characterisations, the distinguishing power of e.g. logical or quantum graph isomorphism relaxations can be studied with graph-theoretic means. In this vein, Roberson (2022) conjectured that homomorphism indistinguishability over every graph class excluding some minor is not the same as isomorphism. We prove this conjecture for all vortex-free graph classes. In particular, homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded Euler genus is not the same as isomorphism. As a negative result, we show that Roberson's conjecture fails when generalised to graph classes excluding a topological minor.
  Furthermore, we show homomorphism distinguishing closedness for several graph classes including all topological-minor-closed and union-closed classes of forests, and show that homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of genus $\leq g$ (and other parameters) forms a strict hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study various classes of partition functions such as those related to the parity of the number of parts, to differences of partition numbers, and to partitions with a repeated smallest part. We establish identities connecting these various classes of partitions. Moreover, our identities help us to extend the Euler's partition theorem. An analogue of Legendre's theorem of the partition-theoretic interpretation of Euler's pentagonal number theorem is also derived. Both combinatorial and $q$-series proofs are given for our results.</description>

      <title>Additive sink subtraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subtraction games are a classical topic in Combinatorial Game Theory. A result of Golomb~(1966) shows that every subtraction game with a finite move set has an eventually periodic nim-sequence, but the known proof yields only an exponential upper bound on the period length. Flammenkamp (1997) conjectures a striking classification for three-move subtraction games: non-additive rulesets exhibit linear period lengths of the form ``the sum of two moves'', where the choice of which two moves displays fractal-like behavior, while additive sets $S=\{a,b,a+b\}$ have purely periodic outcomes with linear or quadratic period lengths. Despite early attention in \emph{Winning Ways} (1982), the general additive case remains open. We introduce and analyze a dual winning convention, which we call {\sc sink subtraction}. Unlike the standard wall convention, where moves to negative positions are forbidden, the sink convention declares a player the winner upon moving to a non-positive position. We show that {\sc additive sink subtraction} admits a complete solution: the nim-sequence is purely periodic with an explicit linear or quadratic period formula, and we conjecture a duality between additive sink subtraction and classical wall subtraction. Keywords: Additive Subtraction Game, Nimber, Periodicity, Sink Convention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for all integers $2\le s\le t$, any $K_{s,t}$-free subset of $[N]$ with size $\Omega(n^{1-1/s})$ must contain a nontrivial solution to every fixed translation-invariant linear equation in at least five variables. This extends earlier results for Sidon sets due to Conlon-Fox-Sudakov-Zhao and Prendiville to the full family of $K_{s,t}$-free sets.
  We also study the corresponding problem in vector spaces over finite fields. In $\mathbb F_q^n$ we obtain stronger quantitative bounds, including polylogarithmic savings, by combining Fourier-analytic transference with polynomial-method input from the arithmetic cycle-removal lemma of Fox-Lov\'asz-Sauermann.</description>

      <title>Uniformly balanced $H$-factors in multicoloured complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A balanced colouring of a graph is one in which every colour appears the same number of times. Given a fixed graph $H$ on $r$ vertices and a balanced $k$-colouring of the complete graph $K_{nrk}$, Hollom (2025) asked the following question: can we always find an $H$-factor $F$ covering all vertices of the complete graph $K_{nrk}$ such that the inherited colouring of $F$ is almost balanced? This is known to be the case for palettes of only two colours, or when $H$ is only a single edge. We answer the above question in full, finding an $H$-factor which is at most $C_{r,k}$ edges away from being balanced, where $C_{r,k}$ depends only on $r$ and $k$. In fact, we work in the more general setting wherein our palette of colours is a subset of $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, and find an $H$-factor where the sum of the colours of all edges has bounded Euclidean norm.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Geodetic Graphs in Terms of their Embedded Even Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of finding the general classification of geodetic graphs is still open. We believe that one of the obstacles to attain this goal is that geodetic graphs lack a structural description. In other words, their fundamental properties have not yet been established in terms of the description of the complete graphs, paths and cycles contained within them. The absence of this information makes their generation and enumeration (as inherent parts of their general classification) a difficult task. This paper examines the structural qualities of geodetic graphs using their so-called embedded even graphs. To this effect, the necessary and sufficient conditions for eliminating the nongeodecity of each pair of C-opposite vertices in an even cycle C have been formulated, while the bigeodecity of the embedded even graphs of a geodetic graph has been established. In a sense, this allows us to arrive at the conclusion that the basic building blocks of geodetic graphs are precisely this class of bigeodetic ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any finite reductive group, we compute the central elements in its Hecke algebra that arise from partial Springer resolutions via the Harish-Chandra transform. Of the two kinds of partial resolution, the larger is the more interesting case. We deduce formulas for associated Hecke traces, generalizing work of Wan-Wang beyond type $A$, and Deodhar-like decompositions of braid varieties that map to partial Springer resolutions. From the latter, we construct noncrossing sets that interpolate between rational Catalan and parking objects, generalizing our work with Galashin-Lam. In parallel, we establish new formulas for arbitrary $a$-degrees of the HOMFLYPT invariants of positive braid closures, from which we construct noncrossing sets for rational Kirkman numbers.</description>

      <title>Nested ansatz method for Baker-Akhiezer functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain that the logic behind the derivation of the Noumi-Shiraishi function can be applied directly to the Baker-Akhiezer function (BAF). This amounts to changing an ansatz for BAF to a nested one, where the BAF of N + 1 variables is recursively expressed as a sum over BAFs of N variables. This may be seen as a generalization of symmetrization trick from [1], but for the generally non-symmetric BAF. We demonstrate that, for usual non-twisted (a = 1) BAFs, this method correctly reproduces the Noumi-Shiraishi formula directly from linear equations, resolving the ambiguity related to non-simple roots. For the first non-trivial twisted case (N = 3, a = 2) this method also fixes this ambiguity, moreover, answers for the first few layers of coefficients are in the form of direct quantization of [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From any graph $G$ arises a flat space wavefunction, obtained by integrating a product of propagators associated to the vertices and edges of $G$. This function is a key ingredient in the computation of cosmological correlators, and several representations for it have been proposed. We formulate three such representations and prove their correctness. In particular, we show that the flat space wavefunction can be read off from the canonical form of the cosmological polytope, and we settle a conjecture of Fevola, Pimentel, Sattelberger, and Westerdijk regarding a partial fraction decomposition for the flat space wavefunction. The terms of the decomposition correspond to certain collections of connected subgraphs associated to $G$ and its spanning subgraphs, reflecting the fact that the flat space wavefunction contains information about how $G$ is connected.</description>

      <title>Balanced weighted Motzkin paths: Pearson structure and saddlepoint asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse weighted Motzkin paths with step multiplicities that vary linearly with height. In the balanced case the associated exponential generating function satisfies a Pearson-type PDE, and solving by characteristics yields closed expressions in all drift regimes. These formulas reveal a moving algebraic singularity that governs both local and global behaviour. Locally this gives a Gaussian central window for the terminal-height distribution, while globally we identify an explicit limit cumulant generating function and prove an $n$-speed large-deviation principle. For finite $n$, Daniels' lattice saddlepoint approximation provides a single formula that is accurate across the full range of $k$; in all quadratic regimes it achieves a uniform interior relative error of order $n^{-1}$. The results link Pearson geometry with uniform saddlepoint methods and extend naturally to other weighted path models and tridiagonal recurrences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How cooperation originates and persists among self-interested individuals is a central question in the social and behavioural sciences. In the canonical two-dimensional spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with unconditional imitation introduced by Nowak and May (1992), simulations on a Moore lattice show an abrupt drop in cooperation near the temptation $T\approx5/3$, yet even under these harsh conditions cooperative structures can still arise. However, the nucleation rates of these motifs, and their contribution along the full cooperation curve had not been quantified. Here we show, using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations combined with automatic cluster classification, that on the Moore lattice for $T\ge5/3$ residual cooperation is sustained exclusively by $3\times3$ (or larger) rectangular cooperator bricks, whereas on degree-8 random-regular graphs for $T\gtrsim1.5$ it is dominated by star-like motifs (1 hub + 8 leaves). Once the dynamics becomes nucleation limited, the macroscopic cooperation level is therefore governed by the statistics of a few exceptionally resilient shapes, rather than by many different cooperator motifs. Furthermore, we show that the lattice cooperation collapse near $T=5/3$ is kinetic rather than critical: the reduction in cooperation is not due to a loss of growth capacity of rectangular bricks, but to the progressive destabilisation of the subcritical motifs that dominate just below this threshold. Our results show that residual cooperation at high temptation is a rare-event nucleation phenomenon governed by a small set of topological traps, and highlight the value of motif-level analysis for explaining and engineering cooperation in spatial, social, and technological networks.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued-Matrix Permanents: SPA-based Approximations and Double-Cover Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating the permanent of a complex-valued matrix is a fundamental problem with applications in Boson sampling and probabilistic inference. In this paper, we extend factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of non-negative-real-valued matrices that are based on running the sum-product algorithm (SPA) on standard normal factor graphs, to factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of complex-valued matrices that are based on running the SPA on double-edge normal factor graphs.
  On the algorithmic side, we investigate the behavior of the SPA, in particular how the SPA fixed points change when transitioning from real-valued to complex-valued matrix ensembles. On the analytical side, we use graph covers to analyze the Bethe approximation of the permanent, i.e., the approximation of the permanent that is obtained with the help of the SPA.
  This combined algorithmic and analytical perspective provides new insight into the structure of Bethe approximations in complex-valued problems and clarifies when such approximations remain meaningful beyond the non-negative-real-valued settings.</description>

      <title>Graphical composition of mapping spaces between modules of configuration-space-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In embedding calculus, spaces of embeddings are identified with derived mapping spaces between framed Fulton-MacPherson-type modules (framed configuration spaces). Unfortunately, there are no sufficiently good algebraic models for framed Fulton-MacPherson modules that would allow us to explicitly describe the rational homotopy type of the embedding space. Recently there were several attempts to avoid dealing with the framed versions of Fulton-MacPherson modules by considering framed manifolds, e.g. embeddings modulo immersions $\overline{\mathrm{Emb}}$ in a recent paper by Fresse, Turchin and Willwacher, or embeddings with a deformation of the framing $\widetilde{\mathrm{Emb}}$ in a recent paper by the author. In both cases, the rational homotopy type of the corresponding embedding space has an explicit description in terms of graphs (hairy graph complexes).
  We construct a combinatorial graphical composition for the composition of embedding spaces $\widetilde{\mathrm{Emb}}$. As a step on our way, we describe the action of the coinduction functor on configuration-space-type $e_n^c$-comodules.</description>

      <title>Tensor decomposition of Demazure crystals for symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the tensor product of Demazure crystals for symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras. It is not necessary that the tensor product of Demazure crystals is isomorphic to a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the decomposition of the tensor product of Demazure crystals as a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. Our results are the generalization of the results proved by Anthony Joseph and Takafumi Kouno. As an application, we obtain a sufficient condition when the product of Demazure characters is a linear combination of Demazure characters with nonnegative integer coefficients. In particular, we obtain a partial solution for the key positivity problem.</description>

      <title>On series identities involving $\binom{4k}k$ and harmonic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The harmonic numbers are those $H_n=\sum_{0&lt;k\le n}\frac1k\ (n=0,1,2,\ldots)$. In this paper we confirm over ten conjectural series identities with summands involving the binomial coefficient $\binom{4k}k$ and harmonic numbers. For example, we prove the identities $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\binom{4k}{k}}{16^k}\left((22k^2-92k+11)H_{4k}-\frac{449k-275}{2}-\frac{85}{12k}\right)=-151-\frac{80}{3}\log{2}$$ and $$ \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{\binom{4k}{k}((11k^2+8k+1)(10H_{4k}-17H_{2k})+2k+18)}{(3k+1)(3k+2)16^k}=8\log2,$$ which were previously conjectured by Z.-W. Sun.</description>

      <title>On the Distance Distribution of Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give error bounds for the distance distribution of Reed-Muller codes, extending prior work on the distance distribution of Reed-Solomon codes. This is equivalent to the problem of counting multivariate polynomials over a finite field with prescribed degree, coefficients, and number of zeroes. We provide a solution to this problem using the character sum method, which offers a new unified framework applicable to a broad class of polynomial enumeration problems over finite fields that involve prescribed evaluation vectors.
  This work effectively makes the first systematic attempt to study the coset weight distribution problem for Reed-Muller codes of fixed degree over large finite fields, which was proposed in MacWilliams and Sloane's 1977 textbook \emph{The Theory of Error Correcting Codes}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While sporadic examples of virtual resolutions with homology have been constructed, their occurrence is not well understood or controlled. Our results build a new set of tools for studying virtual resolutions of monomial ideals as arising from simplicial complexes, including characterizing them by the acyclicity of certain induced subcomplexes. Using this characterization, we give a description of minimal simplicial complexes supporting virtual resolutions as well as a technique for removing homology from simplicial virtual resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.06591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enumerate cubic (3-regular) unicellular maps on closed surfaces up to all homeomorphisms. Using the orbifold approach, we reduce the unsensed enumeration to explicit counts of quotient maps and rooted cubic/precubic maps on simpler surfaces. For orientable hosts this yields a compact identity expressed through known sensed and rooted numbers; for non orientable hosts we obtain a fully explicit finite sum expression via precubic counts. Numerical tables are provided, together with a brief asymptotic discussion.</description>

      <title>Box-ball systems and RSK recording tableaux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A box-ball system (BBS) is a discrete dynamical system consisting of n balls in an infinite strip of boxes. During each BBS move, the balls take turns jumping to the first empty box, beginning with the smallest-numbered ball. The one-line notation of a permutation can be used to define a BBS state. This paper proves that the Robinson--Schensted (RS) recording tableau of a permutation completely determines the dynamics of the box-ball system containing the permutation.
  Every box-ball system eventually reaches steady state, decomposing into solitons. We prove that the rightmost soliton is equal to the first row of the RS insertion tableau and it is formed after at most one BBS move. This fact helps us compute the number of BBS moves required to form the rest of the solitons. First, we prove that if a permutation has an L-shaped soliton decomposition then it reaches steady state after at most one BBS move. Permutations with L-shaped soliton decompositions include noncrossing involutions and column reading words. Second, we make partial progress on the conjecture that every permutation on n objects reaches steady state after at most n-3 BBS moves. Furthermore, we study the permutations whose soliton decompositions coincide with standard tableaux; we conjecture that they are closed under consecutive pattern containment and that the RS recording tableaux belonging to such permutations are counted by the Motzkin numbers.</description>

      <title>Pascal Determinantal Arrays and a Generalization of Rahimpour's Determinantal Identity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new infinite family of arrays, the \emph{Pascal determinantal arrays} of order $k$, denoted $PD_k$, which generalize the classical Pascal array via determinantal constructions. We present a recursive algorithm for generating $PD_k$, establish its correctness using Dodgson's condensation and a weighted sliding-cross rule, and provide a geometric interpretation of the entries $P^{(k)}_{i,j}$ as weighted double sticks in the Pascal plane. Our main result proves a conjecture that generalizes Rahimpour's identity: for all $i,j,k \ge 0$, \[ P^{(k)}_{i,j} = P^{(j)}_{i,k}, \] where $P^{(k)}_{i,j}$ is the determinant of the $k \times k$ subarray of the Pascal array starting at $(i,j)$. The proof combines algebraic recurrence techniques with a visual, geometry-based argument that reveals the intrinsic symmetry of determinantal Pascal structures.</description>

      <title>Do K33-Free Latin Squares Exist?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of existence of latin squares without a substructure consisting of six elements $(r_1,c_2,l_3)$, $(r_2,c_3,l_1)$, $(r_3,c_1,l_2)$, $(r_2,c_1,l_3)$, $(r_3,c_2,l_1)$, $(r_1,c_3,l_2)$. Equivalently, the corresponding latin square graph does not have an induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_{3,3}$. The exhaustive search [Brouwer, Wanless. Universally noncommutative loops. 2011] says that there are no such latin squares of order $3$--$7$, $9$--$11$ and there are only two $K_{3,3}$-free latin squares of order $8$, up to equivalence. We repeat the search, establishing also the number of latin $m$-by-$n$ rectangles for each $m$ and $n$ less than or equal to $11$. As a switched combination of two orthogonal latin squares of order $8$, we construct a $K_{3,3}$-free (universally noncommutative) latin square of order $16$.
  We also consider a similar problem for orthogonal latin squares, proving that there are both $K_{4,4}$-free and non-$K_{4,4}$-free linear pairs of orthogonal latin squares for each odd prime-power order larger than~$5$.

      <title>Dimension of splines on graphs in the case of degree two and smoothness one in two variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous spline functions are defined as piecewise polynomials on the faces of a polyhedral complex that agree on the intersections of two faces. Splines are used in approximation theory and numerical analysis, with applications in data interpolation, to create smooth curves in computer graphics and to find numerical solutions to partial differential equations. Gilbert, Tymoczko, and Viel generalized the classical splines combinatorially and algebraically: a generalized spline is a vertex labeling of a graph $G$ by elements of the ring so that the difference between the labels of any two adjacent vertices lies in the ideal generated by the corresponding edge label. We study the generalized splines on the planar graphs whose edges are labeled by two-variable polynomials of the form $(ax+by+c)^2$ and whose vertices are labeled by polynomials of degree at most two. In this paper we address the upper-bound conjecture for the dimension of degree-2 splines of smoothness 1. The dimension is expressed in terms of the rank of the extended cycle basis matrix. We also provide a combinatorial algorithm on graphs to compute the rank by contracting certain subgraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a guessing game, permutation Wordle, in which a guesser attempts to recover a hidden permutation in $S_n$. In each round, the guesser guesses a permutation (using information from previous rounds) and is told which entries of that permutation are correct. We describe a natural guessing strategy, which we believe to be optimal. We show that the number of permutations this strategy solves in $k+1$ rounds is the Eulerian number $A(n,k)$.
  We also describe an extension to suited permutations: the setter chooses a permutation in $S_n$ and also a coloring of $[n]$ using $s$ colors. We generalize our strategy, give a recurrence for the number of suited permutations solved in $k+1$ rounds, and relate these numbers to the Eulerian numbers. In the case of two suits, or signed permutations, we also relate these numbers to the Eulerian numbers of type B.</description>

Abstract: The independent set sequence of trees has been well studied, with much effort devoted to the (still open) question of Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s on whether the independent set sequence of a tree is always unimodal.
  Much less attention has been given to the independent set sequence of hypertrees. Here we study some natural first questions in this realm. We show that the strong independent set sequences of linear hyperpaths and of linear hyperstars are unimodal (actually, log-concave). For uniform linear hyperpaths we obtain explicit expressions for the number of strong independent sets of each possible size, both via generating functions and via combinatorial arguments. We also consider the uniform linear hypercomb with $n$ edges on the spine, and show that its strong independent set sequence is unimodal except possibly for a portion of length $o(n)$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of trees with independence numbers going to infinity for which the log-concavity relation for the independent set sequence of a tree $T$ in the family fails at around $\alpha(T)\left(1-1/(16\log \alpha(T))\right)$. Here $\alpha(T)$ is the independence number of $T$. This resolves a conjecture of Kadrawi and Levit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 2018 paper, Davis and Sagan studied several pattern-avoiding polytopes. They found that a particular pattern-avoiding Birkhoff polytope had the same normalized volume as the order polytope of a certain poset, leading them to ask if the two polytopes were unimodularly equivalent. Motivated by Davis and Sagan's question, in this paper we define a pattern-avoiding Birkhoff polytope called a $c$-Birkhoff polytope for each Coxeter element $c$ of the symmetric group. We then show that the $c$-Birkhoff polytope is unimodularly equivalent to the order polytope of the heap poset of the $c$-sorting word of the longest permutation. When $c=s_1s_2\dots s_{n}$, this result recovers an affirmative answer to Davis and Sagan's question. Another consequence of this result is that the normalized volume of the $c$-Birkhoff polytope is the number of the longest chains in the (type A) $c$-Cambrian lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combinatorial discrepancy of arithmetic progressions inside $[N] := \{1, \ldots, N\}$ is the smallest integer $D$ for which $[N]$ can be colored with two colors so that any arithmetic progression in $[N]$ contains at most $D$ more elements from one color class than the other. Bounding the discrepancy of such set systems is a classical problem in discrepancy theory. More recently, this problem was generalized to arithmetic progressions in grids like $[N]^d$ (Valk{\'o}) and $[N_1]\times \ldots \times [N_d]$ (Fox, Xu, and Zhou). In the latter setting, Fox, Xu, and Zhou gave upper and lower bounds on the discrepancy that match within a $\frac{\log |\Omega|}{\log \log |\Omega|}$ factor, where $\Omega := [N_1]\times \ldots \times [N_d]$ is the ground set. In this work, we use the connection between factorization norms and discrepancy to improve their upper bound to be within a $\sqrt{\log|\Omega|}$ factor from the lower bound. We also generalize Fox, Xu, and Zhou's lower bound, and our upper bounds to arithmetic progressions in arbitrary convex bodies.</description>

      <title>The dimension of sparse and co-sparse random graph orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random graph order is a partial order obtained from a random graph on $[n]$ by taking the transitive closure of the adjacency relation. The dimension of the random graph orders from random bipartite graphs $B(n,n,p)$ and from $G(n,p)$ were previously studied when $p=\Omega(\log n/n)$ and when $p$ is not too close to 1. There is a conjectured phase transition in the sparse range at $p=1/n$. In this paper, we investigate this conjectured phase transition and estimate the dimension of the partial orders arising from $B(n,n,p)$ and $G(n,p)$ when $p=O(1/n)$. For the random bipartite order, we additionally estimate its dimension in the co-sparse regime, thereby closing all previously open ranges of $p$. Finally, we establish a general upper bound on the dimension of partial orders based on their decompositions into suborders, a result that is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the following question of Bollob\'as and Scott: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $p\binom{n}{2}$ edges. What is the smallest $c(p, n)$ such that there is an ordering $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ of the vertices in $G$ with $\left|e(\{v_1, \ldots, v_i\})-p\binom{i}{2}\right|\leq c(p, n)$ for all $i\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ ? We obtain upper and lower bounds for $c(p,n)$ that are both linear in $n$. Furthermore, we generalize the result to $k$-uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Myhill-Nerode for hypergraphs and an application to gain-graphic matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Myhill-Nerode theorem for hypergraphs. The theorem involves an operation which takes two input structures and produces a hypergraph as output. Using this operation, we define a Myhill-Nerode-type equivalence relation and show that if a class of hypergraphs is definable in the counting monadic second-order logic of hypergraphs, then the equivalence relation has finite index. We apply this tool to classes of gain-graphic matroids, and show that if the group $\Gamma$ is not uniformly locally finite, then the class of $\Gamma$\dash gain-graphic matroids is not monadically definable. (A group is uniformly locally finite if, for every $k$, there is a maximum size amongst subgroups generated by at most $k$ elements.) In addition, we define the conviviality graph of a group, and show that if the group $\Gamma$ has an infinite conviviality graph, then the class of $\Gamma$\dash gain-graphic matroids is not monadically definable. This will be useful in future constructions.</description>

      <title>The Tur\'{a}n number of Berge matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$, an $r$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is a {\em Berge-$F$} if there is a bijection $\phi:E(F)\to E(\mathcal{H})$ such that $e\subseteq \phi(e)$ for each $e\in E(F)$. Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs, an $r$-uniform hypergraph is $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subhypergraph. The Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathcal{F}$ is the maximum number of hyperedges in an $\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-graph on $n$ vertices. Let $M_{s+1}$ denote a matching of size $s+1$, i.e., the graph consisting of $s+1$ independent edges. Khormali and Palmer [\textit{European J. Combin.} 102 (2022) 103506] completely determined the Tur\'{a}n number of Berge matchings for sufficiently large $n$. Subsequently, Kang, Ni, and Shan [\textit{Discrete Math.} 345 (2022) 112901] determined the exact value of the Tur\'{a}n number of Berge-$M_{s+1}$ for all $n$ when $r \le s-1$ or $r \ge 2s+2$. In this paper, we settle the final open case $s \le r \le 2s+1$, thereby completing the determination of the Tur\'{a}n number of Berge matchings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-dimensional lattice polytope ${\mathcal Q}_\sigma$ can be associated to any composition $\sigma$ of a positive integer $n$, as a special case of constructions due to Pitman--Stanley and Chapoton. The entries of the $h$-vector of $\sigma$, introduced by Chapoton, enumerate the lattice points in ${\mathcal Q}_\sigma$ by the number of their nonzero coordinates. Chapoton conjectured that this vector is equal to the $h$-vector of a flag simplicial polytope. This paper proves this conjecture. Moreover, it shows that the gamma-vector associated to the $h$-vector of $\sigma$ is nonnegative by means of an explicit combinatorial interpretation and confirms certain other conjectures of Chapoton on the lattice point enumeration of composition polytopes. A combinatorial interpretation of their $h^\ast$-polynomials is deduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph is considered neutral if its assortativity coefficient $r$ is equal to zero. In this paper, we address an outstanding conjecture, i.e., whether is there a neutral graph on $n$ vertices? First, we show that for $n\geq7$, there is at least one neutral tree, which suggests that we find a representative of any order neutral graph. Additionally, we obtain that given $n\geq13$, there exists at least one neutral non-tree graph.</description>

      <title>A Factorization of the Log-Concavity Operator for Pascal Determinantal Arrays and Their Infinite Row-Wise Log-Concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Pascal determinantal arrays $\PD_k$, whose entries $\PD_k(i,j)$ are the $k\times k$ minors of the lower-triangular Pascal matrix $P=( \binom{a}{b} )_{a,b\ge 0}$.
  We prove an exact factorization of the row-wise log-concavity operator:
  \[
  \LC(\PD_k)=\PD_{k-1}\Had\PD_{k+1},
  \]
  where $\LC(a)_j=a_j^2-a_{j-1}a_{j+1}$ and $\Had$ denotes the Hadamard (entrywise) product.
  This identity is established by an elementary algebraic manipulation implicitly based on the idea of start of David rule.
  We further prove a general inequality asserting that the log-concavity operator is submultiplicative under Hadamard products of log-concave arrays:
  $\LC(A\Had X)\ge\LC(A)\Had\LC(X)$.
  Combining the factorization with this inequality yields a uniform algebraic proof that every row of every array $\PD_k$ ($k\ge 1$) is infinitely log-concave, extending the celebrated theorem of
  Br\"and\'en for the particular case of Pascal's triangle ($\PD_1$) to the entire determinantal hierarchy.
  Applications include the log-convexity of $\{\PD_k(i,j)\}_{k\ge 0}$ in the determinantal order $k$ and a family of determinantal Hadamard inequalities.</description>

      <title>The satisfiability threshold and solution space of random uniquely extendable constraint satisfaction problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the satisfiability threshold and solution-space geometry of random constraint satisfaction problems defined over uniquely extendable (UE) constraints. Motivated by a conjecture of Connamacher and Molloy, we consider random $k$-ary UE-SAT instances in which each constraint function is drawn, according to a certain distribution $\pi$, from a specified subset of uniquely extendable constraints over an $r$-spin set. We introduce a flexible model $H_n(\pi,k,m)$ that allows arbitrary distributions $\pi$ on constraint types, encompassing both random linear systems and previously studied UE-SAT models. Our main result determines the satisfiability threshold for a wide family of distributions $\pi$. Under natural reducibility or symmetry conditions on $\operatorname{supp}(\pi)$, we prove that the satisfiability threshold of $H_n(\pi,k,m)$ coincides with the classical $k$-XORSAT threshold.</description>

      <title>Extremal results on Berge disjoint paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem gave the Tur\'an number of paths. Bushaw and Kettle generalized this result to consider the Tur\'an number of disjoint paths. Since then, many studies are focused on the Tur\'an number of linear forest. For a graph $F$, an $r$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is a $\text{Berge-} F$ if there is a bijection $\phi: E(F)\to E(\mathcal{H})$ such that $e\subseteq \phi(e)$ for each $e\in E(F)$. When $F$ is a path, we call $\text{Berge-} F$ a Berge path. The Tur\'an number of Berge paths was initially studied by Gy\H{o}ri, Katona and Lemons. They gave the value of $\text{ex}_r(n,\text{Berge-}P_\ell)$ for $\ell&gt;r+1$. This result is a generalization of Erd\H{o}s-Galli Theorem. Since then, the Tur\'an number of Berge paths has received widespread attention.
  Recently, Zhou, Gerbner and Yuan initially studied the Tur\'an number of Berge disjoint paths and for the cases when all the paths have odd length. In this paper, we give a more general result, which gives the exact value of $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,\text{Berge-} kP_{\ell})$ for all $k\geq 2$, $r\ge 3$, and $\ell\geq r+7$.</description>

      <title>Basis Number of Graphs Excluding Minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basis number of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that the cycle space of $G$ is generated by a family of cycles using each edge at most $k$ times. A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number. Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Boja\'nczyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture. Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a sharp point-sphere incidence bound in finite fields for point sets exhibiting controlled additive structure. Working in the framework of \((4,s)\)-Salem sets, which quantify pseudorandomness via fourth-order additive energy, we prove that if \(P\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d\) is a \((4,s)\)-Salem set with \(s\in \big( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2} \big]\) and \(|P|\ll q^{ \frac{d}{4s}}\), then for any finite family \(S\) of spheres in \(\mathbb{F}_q^d\), \[ \bigg| I(P,S)-\frac{|P||S| }{q} \bigg| \ll q^{\frac{d}{4}}\,|P|^{1-s}\,|S|^{\frac{3}{4}}. \] This estimate improves the classical point-sphere incidence bounds for arbitrary point sets across a broad parameter range. The proof combines additive energy estimates with a lifting argument that converts point-sphere incidences into point-hyperplane incidences in one higher dimension while preserving the \((4,s)\)-Salem property. As applications, we derive refined bounds for unit distances and sum-product type phenomena, and we extend the method to \((u,s)\)-Salem sets for even moments \(u\ge4\).</description>

Abstract: Cristofaro-Gardiner and Kleinman showed the complete period collapse of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial of Fibonacci triangles and their irrational limits, by studying the Fourier-Dedekind sums involved in the Ehrhart function of right-angled rational triangles. We generalize this result using integral affine geometrical methods to all Markov triangles, as defined by Vianna. In particular, we show new occurrences of strong period collapse, namely by constructing for each Markov number $p$ a two-sided sequence of rational triangles and two irrational limits with quasipolynomial Ehrhart function of period $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel combinatorial framework at the intersection of Lie theory and algebraic combinatorics, based on a generalization of the Kostant game. We begin by reviewing the foundations of root systems, the classification of Dynkin diagrams, and the structure of Weyl groups. Subsequently, we analyze the original Kostant game as a tool for generating positive roots, demonstrating its unique termination on simply-laced diagrams and its role in an alternative classification thereof.
  The main contribution of this work -- which, to our knowledge, has not been studied before -- is a multi-vertex generalization of the game that allows for the simultaneous modification of multiple vertices of a Dynkin diagram. We prove that the resulting configurations of this new game establish a natural bijection with the elements of the quotient W/W_J of Weyl groups by parabolic subgroups. This formalism is applied to problems in algebraic geometry, specifically addressing cases of the Mukai conjecture via Hilbert polynomials, and is accompanied by a computational implementation in Java. These results offer new combinatorial perspectives for studying root counting problems, the regularity of reduced word languages, and the construction of Young Tableaux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.07748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sunada's work on crystallography emphasizes the role of the "maximal abelian cover" of a graph $X$. This is a covering space of $X$ for which the group of deck transformations is the first homology group $H_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$. An embedding of the maximal abelian cover in a vector space can serve as the pattern for a crystal: atoms are located at the vertices, while bonds lie along the edges. We prove that for any connected graph $X$ without bridges, there is a canonical embedding of the maximal abelian cover of $X$ into the vector space $H_1(X,\mathbb{R})$, called a "topological crystal". Crystals of graphene and diamond are examples of this construction. We prove that any symmetry of a graph lifts to a symmetry of its topological crystal. We also compute the density of atoms in a topological crystal. The key technical tools are a way of decomposing the 1-chain coming from a path in $X$ into manageable pieces, and the work of Bacher, de la Harpe and Nagnibeda on integral cycles and integral cuts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph in the sparse regime in the limit as the number of vertices $n$ tends to infinity. We are interested in what this graph looks like when it contains many triangles, in two settings. First, we derive asymptotically sharp bounds on the probability that the graph contains a large number of triangles. We show that conditionally on this event, with high probability the graph contains an almost complete subgraph, i.e., the triangles form a near-clique, and has the same local limit as the original Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Second, we derive asymptotically sharp bounds on the probability that the graph contains a large number of vertices that are part of a triangle. If order $n$ vertices are in triangles, then the local limit (provided it exists) is different from that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Our results shed light on the challenges that arise in the description of real-world networks, which often are sparse, yet highly clustered, and on exponential random graphs, which often are used to model such networks.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions for Sparse Random Sets Under Linear Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A \subseteq \{0,1,\dots,N\}$ be a random set in which each element is included independently with probability $p=p(N)$. Fix an integer $h \geq 2$ and a linear form $$L(x_1,\dots,x_h) := u_1x_1 + \cdots + u_hx_h.$$ We study the random image set \begin{align*}
  L(A) = \left\{ L(a_1,\dots,a_h) : a_i \in A \right\}, \end{align*} inside the feasible interval of values of $L$ on $\{0,1,\dots,N\}^h$, as well as the associated representation counts. Our results exhibit two distinct threshold scales. First, there is a \emph{global} transition at $p(N) \asymp N^{-(h-1)/h}$ governing the size of $L(A)$: below this scale collisions are rare and $L(A)$ is sparse, while above it $L(A)$ contains nearly all feasible values. We give sharp asymptotics for the size of $L(A)$ in all regimes, including inside the critical window. Second, there is a \emph{local} transition at $p(N)\asymp N^{-(h-2)/(h-1)}$ governing multiplicities: for typical values in the bulk, the number of essentially distinct representations is asymptotically Poisson below this scale, and Poisson behavior fails above it. For $h \geq 3$ these scales are separated, yielding a regime in which $L(A)$ is already globally close to full while local multiplicities remain approximately Poisson. Our framework subsumes the classical sumset and difference-set models, as well as generalized sumsets of the form $sA-dA$, as special cases. Notably, after correcting its formulation, our global theorem settles the 2009 threshold conjecture of Hegarty-Miller on the behavior of these random images.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of compiling graphs under the parity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a mathematical framework that utilizes concepts from graph theory to formalize the parity transformation, an encoding strategy for compiling optimization problems on quantum devices. We introduce the transformation as a mapping that encompasses all possible compiled hypergraphs and investigate its uniqueness properties in more detail. Specifically, by introducing so-called loop labelings, we derive an alternative expression of the preimage of any set of compiled hypergraphs under this encoding procedure when all equivalence classes of graphs are being considered. We then deduce equivalent conditions for the injectivity of the parity transformation on any subset of all equivalences classes of graphs. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate that the parity transformation is not an injective mapping, and also introduce an important class of physical layouts and their corresponding set of constraints whose preimage is uniquely determined. In addition, we provide an algorithm which is based on classical algorithms from theoretical computer science and computes a compiled physical layout in this class in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from any planar graph. Atserias et al. [JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general, which motivates the study of its relaxations. In the classical setting, Roberson and Seppelt [ICALP'23] characterized the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism in terms of equality of homomorphism counts from an appropriate graph class. The NPA hierarchy, a noncommutative generalization of the Lasserre hierarchy, provides a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations for quantum isomorphism. In the quantum setting, we show that the feasibility of each level of the NPA hierarchy for quantum isomorphism is equivalent to equality of homomorphism counts from an appropriate class of planar graphs. Combining this characterization with the convergence of the NPA hierarchy, and noting that the union of these classes is the set of all planar graphs, we obtain a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] that avoids the use of quantum groups. Moreover, this homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also yields a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Bizonotopal Graphical Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zonotopal algebras (external, central, and internal) of an undirected graph G introduced by Postnikov-Shapiro and Holtz-Ron, are finite-dimensional commutative graded algebras whose Hilbert series contain a wealth of combinatorial information about G. In this paper, we associate to G a new family of algebras, which we call bizonotopal, because their definition involves doubling the set of edges of G. These algebras are monomial and have intricate properties related, among other things, to the combinatorics of graphical parking functions and their polytopes.
  Unlike the case of usual zonotopal algebras, the Hilbert series of bizonotopal algebras are not specializations of the Tutte polynomial of G. Still, we show that in the external and central cases these Hilbert series satisfy a modified deletion-contraction relation. In addition, we prove that the external bizonotopal algebra is a complete graph invariant.</description>

Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the number of common zeros of a system of $m$ random $n$-variate polynomials over a finite commutative ring $R$. We compute the expected number of common zeros of a system of polynomials over $R$. Then, in the case that $R$ is a field, under a necessary-and-sufficient condition on the sample space, we show that the number of common zeros is binomially distributed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An arrangement of hypersurfaces in projective space is strict normal crossing (SNC) if and only if its Euler discriminant is nonzero. We study the critical loci of arbitrary Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. The family of these loci forms an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the minimal generators of the bihomogeneous prime ideal that defines this variety.</description>

      <title>Lower bounding the MaxCut of high girth 3-regular graphs using the QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study MaxCut on 3-regular graphs of minimum girth $g$ for various $g$'s. We obtain new lower bounds on the maximum cut achievable in such graphs by analyzing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). For $g \geq 16$, at depth $p \geq 7$, the QAOA improves on previously known lower bounds. Our bounds are established through classical numerical analysis of the QAOA's expected performance. This analysis does not produce the actual cuts but establishes their existence. When implemented on a quantum computer, the QAOA provides an efficient algorithm for finding such cuts, using a constant-depth quantum circuit. To our knowledge, this gives an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithm guaranteed to achieve cuts of this size on graphs of this girth. We also apply the QAOA to the Maximum Independent Set problem on the same class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Metric Poincar\'e inequalities for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article obtains purely metric counterparts of cornerstone results in the theory of embedding graphs into normed spaces. Our first main result is a metric analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's extrapolation relating the Poincar\'e constants $\gamma(G,\varrho^p)$ and $\gamma(G,\varrho^q)$ for any exponents $0 &lt; p,q &lt; \infty$, any bounded-degree expander graph $G$, and any target metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$. Our second main result provides a sharp estimate of the Poincar\'e constant $\gamma(G,\varrho)$ in terms of the cardinalities of the vertex set of $G$ and the metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$, in the setting of \textit{random} graphs. This yields optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality of (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, finally establishing a nonlinear analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's celebrated "incompressibility" theorem (1996). Further, we obtain estimates on the nonlinear spectral gap of metric snowflakes and sharp lower bounds on the distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric spaces. Our proofs develop new nonlinear techniques, including random compression methods and a novel structural dichotomy for metric embeddings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for simplicial complexes whose determinantal facet ideals admit reduced Grobner bases under diagonal term orders. Building on and extending foundational results for binomial edge ideals and determinantal ideals, we introduce two new classes of simplicial complexes-strong closed and poor closed-that generalize the notion of closedness in higher dimensions. Our main theorem offers a unified framework that recovers and refines several known results, including those for unit interval graphs and determinantal ideals of complete graphs. In particular, we correct and generalize prior characterizations of Grobner bases for determinantal facet ideals, establishing radicality for strong closed complexes and providing a new proof for the Grobner basis of maximal minors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{S}_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ of degree-$d$ maps from $n$-pointed curves of genus $g$ to $\mathbb{P}^r$. In particular, we obtain formulas for the Serre characteristic, which specializes to the Hodge--Deligne polynomial. Fixing $g, r \geq 1$, we prove that an explicit invertible transform of the generating function for the Serre characteristics is rational. We use our formula to prove a stability result for the weight-graded compactly-supported Euler characteristics of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ as $d \to \infty$. In genus one and two, we reduce the calculation of the Serre characteristic of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ to those of the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ of $n$-pointed curves. Formulas for the latter follow from work of Getzler and Petersen, so our formula in particular determines the Serre characteristic of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ for arbitrary $n$, $r$, and $d$ when $g = 1$ and $g = 2$.</description>

      <title>Fractal transference principles for subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$ of positive density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a multidimensional fractal transference principle for digit-restricted sets associated with subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$, extending the one-dimensional framework of Nakajima--Takahasi, Adv. Math. (2025). We develop general Hausdorff-dimension tools via the singular value potential $\phi^s(\mathbf a)$ and the multivariate Dirichlet series $\zeta_S(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) =\sum_{\mathbf a\in S}\prod_{j=1}^d a_j^{-\sigma_j}$. Let $s_\ast:=\inf\{s&gt;0:\sum_{\mathbf a\in S}\phi^s(\mathbf a)&lt;\infty\}$ and $\Lambda_S:=\inf\{\sigma_1+\cdots+\sigma_d:\zeta_S(\boldsymbol{\sigma})&lt;\infty\}$. We obtain $\dim_H(\mathcal E_S)\le s_\ast$, where $\mathcal E_S\subset(0,1)^d$ denotes the set of points whose continued-fraction digit vectors lie in $S$ and whose coordinates escape (i.e.\ $a_n(x_j)\to\infty$ for each $j$), and $s_\ast=\tfrac12\Lambda_S$ for uniformly $K$--balanced $S$. In particular, if $S\subset\mathbb{N}^d$ has positive upper (or upper Banach) density then $\dim_H(\mathcal E_S)=d/2$. On the combinatorial side, the transference principle ensures that translation-invariant configurations forced at positive density, including multidimensional Szemer\'edi patterns, persist inside the induced fractal digit sets.</description>

      <title>A height-based metaconcept for rooted tree balance and its implications for the $B_1$ index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree balance has received considerable attention in recent years, both in phylogenetics and in other areas. Numerous (im)balance indices have been proposed to quantify the (im)balance of rooted trees. A recent comprehensive survey summarized this literature and showed that many existing indices are based on similar underlying principles. To unify these approaches, three general metaconcepts were introduced, providing a framework to classify, analyze, and extend imbalance indices. In this context, a metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on another function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape. In this manuscript, we extend this line of research by introducing a new metaconcept based on the heights of the pending subtrees of all inner vertices. We provide a thorough analysis of this metaconcept and use it to answer open questions concerning the well-known $B_1$ balance index. In particular, we characterize the tree shapes that maximize the $B_1$ index in two cases: (i) arbitrary rooted trees and (ii) binary rooted trees. For both cases, we also determine the corresponding maximum values of the index.
  Finally, while the $B_1$ index is induced by a so-called third-order metaconcept, we explicitly introduce three new (im)balance indices derived from the first- and second-order height metaconcepts, respectively, thereby demonstrating that pending subtree heights give rise to a variety of novel (im)balance indices.</description>
