      <title>$q$-Whittaker polynomials: bases, branching and direct limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $q$-Whittaker polynomials and their monomial expansions given by the fermionic formula, the inv statistic of Haglund-Haiman-Loehr and the quinv statistic of Ayyer-Mandelshtam-Martin. The combinatorial models underlying these expansions are partition overlaid patterns and column strict fillings. The former model is closely tied to representations of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_n}$ and admits projections, branching maps and direct limits that mirror these structures in the Chari-Loktev basis of local Weyl modules. We formulate novel versions of these notions in the column strict fillings model and establish their main properties. We construct weight-preserving bijections between the models which are compatible with projection, branching and direct limits. We also establish connections to the coloured lattice paths formalism for $q$-Whittaker polynomials due to Wheeler and collaborators.</description>

      <title>Complexity of graph evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permutation of the elements of a graph is a {\it construction sequence} if no edge is listed before either of its endpoints. The complexity of such a sequence is investigated by finding the delay in placing the edges, an {\it opportunity cost} for the construction sequence. Maximum and minimum cost c-sequences are provided for a variety of graphs and are used to measure the complexity of graph-building programs.</description>

      <title>Pattern avoidance in nonnesting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonnesting permutations are permutations of the multiset $\{1,1,2,2,\dots,n,n\}$ that avoid subsequences of the form $abba$ for any $a\neq b$. These permutations have recently been studied in connection to noncrossing (also called quasi-Stirling) permutations, which are those that avoid subsequences of the form $abab$, and in turn generalize the well-known Stirling permutations. Inspired by the work by Archer et al. on pattern avoidance in noncrossing permutations, we consider the analogous problem in the nonnesting case. We enumerate nonnesting permutations that avoid each set of two or more patterns of length 3, as well as those that avoid some sets of patterns of length 4. We obtain closed formulas and generating functions, some of which involve unexpected appearances of the Catalan and Fibonacci numbers. Our proofs rely on decompositions, recurrences, and bijections.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Extremal Graphs Having No Stable Cutsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confirming a conjecture posed by Caro, it was shown by Chen and Yu that every graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and at most $2n-4$ edges has a stable cutset, which is a stable set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. Le and Pfender showed that all graphs with $n$ vertices and $2n-3$ edges without stable cutset arise recursively glueing together triangles and triangular prisms along an edge or triangle. Le and Pfender's proof contains a gap, which we fill in the present article.</description>

      <title>Categorical approach to graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study a natural category of graph limits. The objects are pairs $(\pi,\mu)$, where $\pi$ (the distribution of vertices) is an abstract probability measure on some abstract measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ and $\mu$ (the distribution of edges) is an abstract finite measure on the square $(X,\mathcal{A})^2$. Morphisms are random maps between the underlying measurable spaces which preserve the distribution of vertices as well as the distribution of edges. We also define a convergence notion (inspired by s-convergence) for sequences of graph limits. We apply tools from category theory to prove the compactness of the space of all graph limits.</description>

      <title>Positioned and primary positioned $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a positive integer cone and $k\in \mathcal{C}$. A $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$ is $k$-positioned if for every $h\in \mathcal{C}\setminus S$ we have that $k-h$ belongs to $S$. In this work, we focus on this family of semigroups and introduce primary positioned $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups, characterizing a subfamily of them through the perspective of irreducibility. Furthermore, we provide some procedures to compute all such semigroups, describing a family of graphs containing all the primary positioned $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups for a fixed $k\in \mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Improvements for lower bounds of mutually orthogonal Latin squares of sizes $54$, $96$ and $108$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will show that there are at least 8, 10 and 9 mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of orders $n=54$, $96$ and $108$. The cases $n=54$ and $96$ are obtained by constructing separable permutation codes consisting of $8 \times 54$ and $10 \times 96$ codeword respectively; in addition, these codes respectively have lengths $54$, $96$ and minimum distances $53$, $95$. Here we will follow exactly the procedure given in \cite{JS2019}. The case $n=108$ is obtained by constructing a $(108,10,1)$ difference matrix. Also, an error in \cite{ACD} for $n=45$ will be corrected.</description>

      <title>The Schrijver system of the length polyhedron of an interval order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The length polyhedron of an interval order $P$ is the convex hull of integer vectors representing the interval lengths in possible interval representations of $P$ in which all intervals have integer endpoints. This polyhedron is an integral translation of a polyhedral cone, with its apex corresponding to the canonical interval representation of $P$ (also known as the minimal endpoint representation).
  In earlier work, we introduced an arc-weighted directed graph model, termed the key graph, inspired by this canonical representation. We showed that cycles in the key graph correspond, via Fourier-Motzkin elimination, to inequalities that describe supporting hyperplanes of the length polyhedron. These cycle inequalities derived from the key graph form a complete system of linear inequalities defining the length polyhedron. By applying a theorem due to Cook, we establish here that this system of inequalities is totally dual integral (TDI).
  Leveraging circulations, total dual integrality, and the special structure of the key graph, our main theorem demonstrates that a cycle inequality is a positive linear combination of other cycle inequalities if and only if it is a positive integral linear combination of smaller cycle inequalities (where `smaller' here refers a natural weak ordering among these cycle inequalities). This yields an efficient method to remove redundant cycle inequalities and ultimately construct the unique minimal TDI-system, also known as the Schrijver system, for the length polyhedron. Notably, if the key graph contains a polynomial number of cycles, this gives a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Schrijver system for the length polyhedron.
  Lastly, we provide examples of interval orders where the Schrijver system has an exponential size.</description>

      <title>How to stab a polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the set of linear subspaces of a fixed dimension intersecting a given polytope. To describe this set as a semialgebraic subset of a Grassmannian, we introduce a Schubert arrangement of the polytope, defined by the Chow forms of the polytope's faces of complementary dimension. We show that the set of subspaces intersecting a specified family of faces is defined by fixing the sign of the Chow forms of their boundaries. We give inequalities defining the set of stabbing subspaces in terms of sign conditions on the Chow form.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Colorings of Disjoint Unions of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymmetric coloring number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices, so that no non-trivial automorphism preserves the color classes. We investigate the asymmetric coloring number of graphs that are disjoint unions of graphs. We will derive a general relationship between the asymmetric coloring number of disjoint copies of graphs and the number of ways to color a single copy asymmetrically, and then look at particular cases such as disjoint copies of paths, stars, cycles, and hypercubes.</description>

      <title>Counting humps and peaks in Motzkin paths with height $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct several bijections among humps of Motzkin paths, standard Young tableaux (SYTs) in a $(2,1)$-hook and two special kinds of Motzkin prefixes. As corollaries, we obtain the number of humps and peaks in Motzkin paths with height $k$, and the number of SYTs with shapes in $\{(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,1,\dots)\mid \lambda_1-\lambda_2=k\}$, which refine Regev's results in 2009. We also give new combinatorial proofs of Regev's results, and reveal some new recurrence relations related to humps, free Motzkin paths and SYTs.</description>

      <title>A spectral condition for spanning trees with restricted degrees in bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$. We use $Q(G)=D(G)+A(G)$ to denote the signless Laplacian matrix of $G$, where $D(G)$ is the diagonal degree matrix of $G$ and $A(G)$ is the adjacency matrix of $G$. The signless Laplacian spectral radius of $G$ is denoted by $q(G)$. A necessary and sufficient condition for a connected bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $(A,B)$ to have a spanning tree $T$ with $d_T(v)\geq k$ for any $v\in A$ was independently obtained by Frank and Gy\'arf\'as (A. Frank, E. Gy\'arf\'as, How to orient the edges of a graph?, Colloq. Math. Soc. Janos Bolyai 18 (1976) 353--364), Kaneko and Yoshimoto (A. Kaneko, K. Yoshimoto, On spanning trees with restricted degrees, Inform. Process. Lett. 73 (2000) 163--165). Based on the above result, we establish a lower bound on the signless Laplacian spectral radius $q(G)$ of a connected bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $(A,B)$, in which the bound guarantees that $G$ has a spanning tree $T$ with $d_T(v)\geq k$ for any $v\in A$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma_k(V)$ be the Grassmann graph whose vertex set is formed by all $k$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over the finite field $F_q$ consisting of $q$ elements. We discuss its subgraph $\Pi(n,k)_q$ formed by projective codes. We show that there are precisely two types of maximal cliques in $\Pi(n,k)_q$: stars and tops. We give a complete description of stars, i.e., maximal cliques consisting of all $k$-dimensional projective codes containing a certain $(k-1)$-dimensional subspace of $V$.</description>

Abstract: Snort is a two-player game played on a simple graph in which the players take turns colouring vertices in their own colour, with the restriction that two adjacent vertices cannot have opposite colours. We will show that on triangular grids with one or two rows of triangles, and many of their variants, the first player will win when playing optimally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a restricted version of a conjecture of M. Talagrand on the relation between "expectation thresholds" and "fractional expectation thresholds" follows easily from a strong version of a second conjecture of Talagrand, on "selector processes." The selector process conjecture was proved by Park and Pham, and the quantitative strengthening used here is due to Bednorz, Martynek, and Meller.</description>

      <title>On Singh and Barman's Conjecture on Hook Length Biases in $t$-Regular Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$, where $t\geq 2$ and $k\geq 1$. Recently, Singh and Barman proved that $b_{3,2}(n)\geq b_{2,2}(n)$ for all $n\geq 4$. They also conjectured that $b_{t+1,2}(n)\geq b_{t,2}(n)$ for $t\geq 3$ and for all $n\geq 0$.

      <title>Clonoids of Boolean functions with essentially unary, linear, semilattice, or 0- or 1-separating source and target clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending Sparks's theorem, we determine the cardinality of the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids of Boolean functions for certain pairs $(C_1,C_2)$ of clones of essentially unary, linear, or $0$- or $1$-separating functions or semilattice operations. When such a $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoid lattice is uncountable, the proof is in most cases based on exhibiting a countably infinite family of functions with the property that distinct subsets thereof always generate distinct $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids. In the cases when the lattice is finite, we enumerate the corresponding $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids. We also provide a summary of the known results on cardinalities of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoid lattices of Boolean functions.</description>

      <title>Transversal Structures in Graph Systems: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a system $\mathcal{G} =\{G_1,G_2,\dots,G_m\}$ of graphs/digraphs/hypergraphs on the common vertex set $V$ of size $n$, an $m$-edge graph/digraph/hypergraph $H$ on $V$ is transversal in $\mathcal{G}$ if there exists a bijection $\phi :E(H)\rightarrow [m]$ such that $e \in E(G_{\phi(e)})$ for all $e\in E(H)$. In this survey, we consider extremal problems for transversal structures in graph systems. More precisely, we summarize some sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of transversal structures in graph/digraph/hypergraph systems, which generalize several classical theorems in extremal graph theory to transversal version. We also include a number of conjectures and open problems.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Proofs of Indistinguishability of Linear Compartmental Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given experimental data, one of the main objectives of biological modeling is to construct a model which best represents the real world phenomena. In some cases, there could be multiple distinct models exhibiting the exact same dynamics, meaning from the modeling perspective it would be impossible to distinguish which model is ``correct.'' This is the study of indistinguishability of models, and in our case we focus on linear compartmental models which are often used to model pharmacokinetics, cell biology, ecology, and related fields. Specifically, we focus on a family of linear compartmental models called skeletal path models which have an underlying directed path, and have recently been shown to have the first recorded sufficient conditions for indistinguishability based on underlying graph structure. In this recent work, certain families of skeletal path models were proven to be indistinguishable, however the proofs relied heavily on linear algebra. In this work, we reprove several of these indistinguishability results instead using a graph theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of random graphs: an approach using a recurrence relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the chromatic number of large graphs is known to be NP-hard. Although various algorithms have been developed to efficiently compute chromatic numbers, they still take an enormous amount of time for large graphs. In this paper, we propose the recurrence relation to obtain the expected value of the chromatic number of random graphs in a short time.</description>

      <title>The fractional Helly number for separable convexity spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convex lattice set in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is the intersection of a convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. A well-known theorem of Doignon states that the Helly number of $d$-dimensional convex lattice sets equals $2^d$, while a remarkable theorem of B\'ar\'any and Matou\v{s}ek states that the fractional Helly number is only $d+1$. In this paper we generalize their result to abstract convexity spaces that are equipped with a suitable separation property. We also disprove a conjecture of B\'ar\'any and Kalai about an existence of fractional Helly property for a family of solutions of bounded-degree polynomial inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define a degree for ends of infinite digraphs. The well-definedness of our definition in particular resolves a problem by Zuther. Furthermore, we extend our notion of end degree to also respect, among others, the vertices dominating the end, which we denote as combined end degree. Our main result is a characterisation of the combined end degree in terms of certain sequences of vertices, which we call end-exhausting sequences. This establishes a similar, although more complex relationship as known for the combined end degree and end-defining sequences in undirected graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all connected induced subgraphs of a graph $G=(V,E)$. As a variation we enumerate all "conn-partitions", i.e. partitions $\Pi$ of $V$ with the property that each part of $\Pi$ induces a connected subgraph. In another vein, we enumerate all $X\subseteq V$ which induce a subgraph that is (respectively) chordal, bipartite, or a forest. Mentioned four algorithms, and two more, run in ouput-polynomial time (and deliver their fare in compressed fashion). Along the way we give fresh and short proofs of well-known facts about bipartite graphs and chordless cycles respectively.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart theory of cosmological polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological polytope of a graph $G$ was recently introduced to give a geometric approach to the computation of wavefunctions for cosmological models with associated Feynman diagram $G$. Basic results in the theory of positive geometries dictate that this wavefunction may be computed as a sum of rational functions associated to the facets in a triangulation of the cosmological polytope. The normalized volume of the polytope then provides a complexity estimate for these computations. In this paper, we examine the (Ehrhart) $h^\ast$-polynomial of cosmological polytopes. We derive recursive formulas for computing the $h^\ast$-polynomial of disjoint unions and $1$-sums of graphs. The degree of the $h^\ast$-polynomial for any $G$ is computed and a characterization of palindromicity is given. Using these observations, a tight lower bound on the $h^\ast$-polynomial for any $G$ is identified and explicit formulas for the $h^\ast$-polynomials of multitrees and multicycles are derived. The results generalize the existing results on normalized volumes of cosmological polytopes. A tight upper bound and a combinatorial formula for the $h^\ast$-polynomial of any cosmological polytope are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Joint Poisson Convergence of Monochromatic Hyperedges in Multiplex Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $r$-uniform hypergraphs $H_n$, denote by $T(H_n)$ the number of monochromatic hyperedges when the vertices of $H_n$ are colored uniformly at random with $c = c_n$ colors. In this paper, we study the joint distribution of monochromatic hyperedges for hypergraphs with multiple layers (multiplex hypergraphs). Specifically, we consider the joint distribution of ${\bf T} _n:= (T(H_n^{(1)}), T(H_n^{(2)}))$, for two sequences of hypergraphs $H_n^{(1)}$ and $H_n^{(2)}$ on the same set of vertices. We will show that the joint distribution of ${\bf T}_n$ converges to (possibly dependent) Poisson distributions whenever the mean vector and the covariance matrix of ${\bf T}_n$ converge. In other words, the joint Poisson approximation of ${\bf T}_n$ is determined only by the convergence of its first two moments. This generalizes recent results on the second moment phenomenon for Poisson approximation from graph coloring to hypergraph coloring and from marginal convergence to joint convergence. Applications include generalizations of the birthday problem, counting monochromatic subgraphs in randomly colored graphs, and counting monochromatic arithmetic progressions in randomly colored integers. Extensions to random hypergraphs and weighted hypergraphs are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ for $d$-regular graphs. It is well-known that $p_c \geq \frac{1}{d-1}$ for such graphs, with equality holding for the $d$-regular tree. We prove that among all quasi-transitive $d$-regular graphs, the equality $p_c(G) = \frac{1}{d-1}$ holds if and only if $G$ is a tree. Furthermore, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the necessity of the quasi-transitive assumption.</description>

      <title>Toric Multivariate Gaussian Models from Symmetries in a Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a rooted tree $T$ on $n$ non-root leaves with colored and zeroed nodes, we construct a linear space $L_T$ of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices with constraints determined by the combinatorics of the tree. When $L_T$ represents the covariance matrices of a Gaussian model, it provides natural generalizations of Brownian motion tree (BMT) models in phylogenetics. When $L_T$ represents a space of concentration matrices of a Gaussian model, it gives certain colored Gaussian graphical models, which we refer to as BMT derived models. We investigate conditions under which the reciprocal variety $L_T^{-1}$ is toric. Relying on the birational isomorphism of the inverse matrix map, we show that if the BMT derived graph of $T$ is vertex-regular and a block graph, under the derived Laplacian transformation, $L_T^{-1}$ is the vanishing locus of a toric ideal. This ideal is given by the sum of the toric ideal of the Gaussian graphical model on the block graph, the toric ideal of the original BMT model, and binomial linear conditions coming from vertex-regularity. To this end, we provide monomial parametrizations for these toric models realized through paths among leaves in $T$.</description>

Abstract: We analyze Sz\"oll\H{o}si's recent construction of a five-dimensional kissing configuration and produce a new such configuration, the fourth to be discovered. We construct five-dimensional sphere packings from these configurations, which augment Conway and Sloane's list of conjecturally optimal packings, and we also construct a new kissing configuration in nine dimensions. None of these constructions improves on the known records, but they provide geometrically distinct constructions achieving these records.</description>

      <title>On the independence of shifts defined on $\mathbb{N}^d$ and trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the independence of shifts defined on $\mathbb{N}^d$ ($\mathbb{N}^d$ shift) and trees (tree-shift). Firstly, for the completeness of the article, we provide a proof that an $\mathbb{N}^d$ shift has positive (topological) entropy if and only if it has an independence set with positive upper density. Secondly, we obtain that when the base shift $X$ is a hereditary shift, then the associated tree-shift $\mathcal{T}_X$ on an unexpandable tree has positive entropy if and only if it has an independence set with positive density. However, the independence of the tree-shift on an expandable tree differs from that of $\mathbb{N}^d$ shifts or tree-shifts on unexpandable trees. The boundary independence property is introduced and we prove that it is equivalent to the positive entropy of a tree-shift on an expandable tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study sequences of topological spaces called "vertical configuration spaces" of points in Euclidean space. We apply the theory of FI$_G$-modules, and results of Bianchi-Kranhold, to show that their (co)homology groups are "representation stable" with respect to natural actions of wreath products $S_k \wr S_n$. In particular, we show that in each (co)homological degree, the (co)homology groups (viewed as $S_k \wr S_n$-representations) can be expressed as induced representations of a specific form. Consequently, the characters of their rational (co)homology groups, and the patterns of irreducible $S_k \wr S_n$-representation constituents of these groups, stabilize in a strong sense. In addition, we give a new proof of rational (co)homological stability for unordered vertical configuration spaces, with an improved stable range.</description>

      <title>Superhypergraph Neural Networks and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks: Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional graphs by allowing edges to connect multiple nodes, while superhypergraphs further generalize this concept to represent even more complex relationships. Neural networks, inspired by biological systems, are widely used for tasks such as pattern recognition, data classification, and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a well-established framework, have recently been extended to Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), with their properties and applications being actively studied. The Plithogenic Graph framework enhances graph representations by integrating multi-valued attributes, as well as membership and contradiction functions, enabling the detailed modeling of complex relationships. In the context of handling uncertainty, concepts such as Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs have gained prominence. It is well established that Plithogenic Graphs serve as a generalization of both Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Graph Neural Network has been proposed and is an active area of research. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the development of SuperHyperGraph Neural Networks (SHGNNs) and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks, expanding the applicability of neural networks to these advanced graph structures. While mathematical generalizations and proofs are presented, future computational experiments are anticipated.</description>

      <title>Minimal Submanifolds and Waists of Locally Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the higher expansion properties of locally symmetric spaces, with a particular focus on octonionic hyperbolic manifolds. We show that codimension two minimal submanifolds of compact octonionic locally symmetric spaces must have large volume, at least linear in the volume of the ambient space. As a corollary we prove linear waist inequalities for octonionic hyperbolic manifolds in codimension two and construct the first locally symmetric examples of power-law systolic freedom. We also show that any codimension two submanifold of small volume can be homotoped to a lower dimensional set. We use this to prove that branched covers of octonionic hyperbolic manifolds are stable in the sense of Dinur-Meshulam and to establish a uniform lower bound on the non-abelian Cheeger constants of octonionic hyperbolic manifolds.
  In a more general setting, we prove that maps from locally symmetric spaces to low dimensional euclidean spaces admit fibers whose fundamental group has large exponent of growth. We show as a consequence that cocompact lattices in $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ have property $ FA_{\lfloor n/8\rfloor-1}$: any action on a contractible $CAT(0)$ simplicial complex of dimension at most $ \lfloor n/8\rfloor -1$ has a global fixed point.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and let $d$ be a positive integer. In this paper, we generalize Iwasawa theory for graphs initiated by Gonet and Valli\`{e}res to weighted graphs. In particular, we prove an analogue of Iwasawa's class number formula and that of Kida's formula for compatible systems of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^d$-covers of weighted graphs. We also provide numerical examples. At the end of this paper, we give an application of the ideas of Iwasawa theory to the theory of discrete-time quantum walks in graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we will associate a family $\{K_1,\dots,K_l\}\subset \mathbb{S}^3$ of iterated torus knots to a given free numerical semigroup. We will describe the fundamental group of the knot complement of each knot of the family. Finally, we will show that all knots in the family have same Alexander polynomial and it coincides (up to a factor) with the Poincar\'e series of the free numerical semigroup. As a consequence, we will provide families of iterated torus knots with the same Alexander polynomial of an irreducible plane curve singularity but which are non-isotopic to its associated knot.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Core Stability Relaxations in Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relationships between different relaxed notions of core stability in hedonic games, which are a class of coalition formation games. Our unified approach applies to a newly introduced family of hedonic games, called $\alpha$-hedonic games, which contains previously studied variants such as fractional and additively separable hedonic games. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the maximum factor with which a blocking coalition of a certain size can improve upon an outcome in which no deviating coalition of size at most $q$ exists. Counterintuitively, we show that larger blocking coalitions might sometimes have lower improvement factors. We discuss the tightness conditions of our bound, as well as its implications on the price of anarchy of core relaxations. Our general result has direct implications for several well-studied classes of hedonic games, allowing us to prove two open conjectures by Fanelli et al. (2021) for fractional hedonic games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate multiplicity codes (Kopparty, Saraf, and Yekhanin, J. ACM 2014) are linear codes where the codewords are described by evaluations of multivariate polynomials (with a degree bound) and their derivatives up to a fixed order, on a suitably chosen affine point set. While good list decoding algorithms for multivariate multiplicity codes were known in some special cases of point sets by a reduction to univariate multiplicity codes, a general list decoding algorithm up to the distance of the code when the point set is an arbitrary finite grid, was obtained only recently (Bhandari et al., IEEE TIT 2023). This required the characteristic of the field to be zero or larger than the degree bound, and this requirement is somewhat necessary, since list decoding this code up to distance with small output list size is not possible when the characteristic is significantly smaller than the degree.
  In this work, we present an alternate construction, based on divided differences, that closely resembles the classical multiplicity codes but is `insensitive to the field characteristic'. We obtain an efficient algorithm that list decodes this code up to distance, for arbitrary finite grids and over all finite fields. Notably, our construction can be interpreted as a `folded Reed-Muller code', which might be of independent interest. The upshot of our result is that a good `Taylor-like expansion' can be expressed in terms of a good `derivative-like operator' (a divided difference), and this implies that the corresponding code admits good algorithmic list decoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.01420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper undertakes a study of the structure of the fibers of the Chevalley exponentiation maps $f_{(i_1,\dots ,i_d)}$. The fibers of these maps $f_{(i_1,\dots ,i_d)}$ encode the nonnegative real relations amongst exponentiated Chevalley generators. Our main theorems show that the fibers admit cell stratifications, that these cell stratifications have the same face posets as interior dual block complexes of subword complexes, and that these posets are contractible.
  We conjecture that each such fiber is a regular CW complex homeomorphic to the interior dual block complex of a subword complex. This conjecture is shown to have as a corollary a new proof of the Fomin-Shapiro Conjecture by way of general topological results regarding approximating maps by homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>A criterion for sharpness in tree enumeration and the asymptotic number of triangulations in Kuperberg's G2 spider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.07984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjectured asymptotic formula of Kuperberg from the representation theory of the Lie algebra $G_2$. Given a non-negative sequence $(a_n)_{n\geq 1}$, the identity $B(x)=A(xB(x))$ for generating functions $A(x)=1+\sum_{n\geq 1} a_n x^n$ and $B(x)=1+\sum_{n\geq 1} b_n x^n$ determines the number $b_n$ of rooted planar trees with $n$ vertices such that each vertex having $i$ children can have one of $a_i$ distinct colors. Kuperberg proved in \cite{Kuperberg} that this identity holds in the case that $b_n=\dim \text{Inv}_{G_2} (V(\lambda_1)^{\otimes n})$, where $V(\lambda_1)$ is the 7-dimensional fundamental representation of $G_2$, and $a_n$ is the number of triangulations of a regular $n$-gon such that each internal vertex has degree at least $6$. He also observed that $\limsup_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{a_n}\leq 7/B(1/7)$ and conjectured that this estimate is sharp, or in terms of power series, that the radius of convergence of $A(x)$ is exactly $B(1/7)/7$. We prove this conjecture by introducing a new criterion for sharpness in the analogous estimate for general power series $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ satisfying $B(x)=A(xB(x))$. Moreover, by way of singularity analysis performed on a recently-discovered generating function for $B(x)$, we significantly refine the conjecture by deriving an asymptotic formula for the sequence $(a_n)$.</description>

      <title>Universal symplectic/orthogonal functions and general branching rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce a family of universal symplectic functions $sp_\lambda(\mathbf{x}^{\pm};\mathbf{z})$ that include symplectic Schur functions $sp_\lambda(\mathbf{x}^{\pm})$, odd symplectic characters $sp_\lambda(\mathbf{x}^{\pm};z)$, universal symplectic characters $sp_\lambda(\mathbf{z})$ and intermediate symplectic characters as subfamilies. We then realize the universal symplectic functions by vertex operators, which naturally lead to their skew versions, and show that $sp_\lambda(\mathbf{x}^{\pm};\mathbf{z})$ obey the general branching rules. This also gives the Gelfand-Tsetlin representations of odd symplectic characters and a transition formula between odd symplectic characters and symplectic Schur functions.
  Secondly we introduce a family of universal orthogonal functions $o_\lambda(\mathbf{x}^{\pm};\mathbf{z})$ and their skew versions in a similar manner, and we provide their vertex operator realizations and obtain transition formulas and the branching rule. The universal orthogonal functions $o_\lambda(\mathbf{x}^{\pm};\mathbf{z})$ generalize orthogonal Schur functions $o_\lambda(\mathbf{x}^{\pm})$, odd orthogonal Schur functions $so_\lambda(\mathbf{x}^{\pm})$, universal orthogonal characters $o_\lambda(\mathbf{z})$ as well as intermediate orthogonal characters.
  Thirdly, we give vertex operator realizations for the $CB$-interpolating Schur functions $s^{CB}_\lambda(x;\beta)$ introduced by Bisi and Zygouras (Adv. Math., 2022) and the $DB$-interpolating Schur functions $s^{DB}_\lambda(x;\beta)$ interpolating between characters of type $D$ and $B$. As an application, we show $s^{CB}_\lambda(x;\beta)$ are equal to the orthosymplectic Schur polynomials $spo_\lambda(x/\beta)$, thus give a short proof of the generalization of the Brent-Krattenthaler-Warnaar identity obtained by Kumari (arXiv:2401.01723).</description>

      <title>Cherry picking in forests: A new characterization for the unrooted hybrid number of two phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are a special type of graph which generalize phylogenetic trees and that are used to model non-treelike evolutionary processes such as recombination and hybridization. In this paper, we consider {\em unrooted} phylogenetic networks, i.e. simple, connected graphs $\mathcal{N}=(V,E)$ with leaf set $X$, for $X$ some set of species, in which every internal vertex in $\mathcal{N}$ has degree three. One approach used to construct such phylogenetic networks is to take as input a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of phylogenetic trees and to look for a network $\mathcal{N}$ that contains each tree in $\mathcal{P}$ and that minimizes the quantity $r(\mathcal{N}) = |E|-(|V|-1)$ over all such networks. Such a network always exists, and the quantity $r(\mathcal{N})$ for an optimal network $\mathcal{N}$ is called the hybrid number of $\mathcal{P}$. In this paper, we give a new characterization for the hybrid number in case $\mathcal{P}$ consists of two trees. This characterization is given in terms of a cherry picking sequence for the two trees, although to prove that our characterization holds we need to define the sequence more generally for two forests. Cherry picking sequences have been intensively studied for collections of rooted phylogenetic trees, but our new sequences are the first variant of this concept that can be applied in the unrooted setting. Since the hybrid number of two trees is equal to the well-known tree bisection and reconnection distance between the two trees, our new characterization also provides an alternative way to understand this important tree distance.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the classification of some natural numbers related to the combinatorics of congruence subgroups of the modular group. More precisely, we will focus here on the notion of minimal monomial solutions. These are the solutions of a matrix equation (also appearing in the study of Coxeter friezes), modulo an integer $N$, whose components are identical and minimal for this property. Our aim here is to study the integers $N$ for which the minimal monomial solutions satisfying some fixed conditions have an irreducibility property. In particular, we will classify the monomially irreducible integers which are the integers for which all the nonzero minimal monomial solutions are irreducible.</description>

Abstract: We prove a precise min-max theorem for the following problem. Let $G$ be an Eulerian graph with a specified set of edges $S \subseteq E(G)$, and let $b$ be a vertex of $G$. Then what is the maximum integer $k$ so that the edge-set of $G$ can be partitioned into $k$ non-zero $b$-trails? That is, each trail must begin and end at $b$ and contain an odd number of edges from~$S$. This theorem is motivated by a connection to vertex-minors and yields two conjectures of M\'{a}\v{c}ajov\'{a} and \v{S}koviera as corollaries.</description>

Abstract: We address a core partition regularity problem in Ramsey theory by proving that every finite coloring of the positive integers contains monochromatic Pythagorean pairs, i.e., $x,y\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x^2\pm y^2=z^2$ for some $z\in \mathbb{N}$. We also show that partitions generated by level sets of multiplicative functions taking finitely many values always contain Pythagorean triples. Our proofs combine known Gowers uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions with a novel and rather flexible approach based on concentration estimates of multiplicative functions.</description>

Abstract: We address a prime counting problem across the homology classes of a graph, presenting a graph-theoretical Dirichlet-type analogue of the prime number theorem. The main machinery we have developed and employed is a spectral antisymmetry theorem, revealing that the spectra of the twisted graph adjacency matrices have an antisymmetric distribution over the character group of the graph with a special character called the canonical character being an extremum. Additionally, we derive some trace formulas based on the twisted adjacency matrices as part of our analysis.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko introduced a $q$-deformation of rational numbers. More precisely, for an irreducible fraction $\frac{r}s&gt;0$, they constructed coprime polynomials $\mathcal{R}_{\frac{r}s}(q),~ \mathcal{S}_{\frac{r}s}(q) \in {\mathbb Z}[q]$ with $\mathcal{R}_{\frac{r}s}(1)=r,~\mathcal{S}_{\frac{r}s}(1)=s$. Their theory has a rich background and many applications. By definition, if $r \equiv r' \pmod{s}$, then $\mathcal{S}_{\frac{r}s}(q)=\mathcal{S}_{\frac{r'}s}(q)$. We show that $rr'{\equiv} -1 \pmod{s}$ implies $\mathcal{S}_{\frac{r}s}(q)=\mathcal{S}_{\frac{r'}s}(q)$, and it is conjectured that the converse holds if $s$ is prime (and $r \not \equiv r' \pmod{s}$). We also show that $s$ is a multiple of 3 (resp. 4) if and only if $\mathcal{S}_{\frac{r}s}(\zeta)=0$ for $\zeta=(-1+\sqrt{-3})/2$ (resp. $\zeta=i$). We give applications to the representation theory of quivers of type $A$ and the Jones polynomials of rational links.</description>

      <title>Eulerian magnitude homology: subgraph structure and random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the connection between the ranks of the magnitude homology groups of a graph and the structure of its subgraphs. To this end, we introduce variants of magnitude homology called eulerian magnitude homology and discriminant magnitude homology. Leveraging the combinatorics of the differential in magnitude homology, we illustrate a close relationship between the ranks of the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal and counts of subgraphs which fall in specific classes. We leverage these tools to study limiting behavior of the eulerian magnitude homology groups for Erdos-Renyi random graphs and random geometric graphs, producing for both models a vanishing threshold for the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal. This in turn provides a characterization of the generators for the corresponding magnitude homology groups. Finally, we develop an explicit asymptotic estimate the expected rank of eulerian magnitude homology along the first diagonal for these random graph models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of the over-Mahonian number, which counts the overlined permutations of length $n$ with $k$ inversions, allowing the first elements associated with the inversions to be independently overlined or not. We explore its properties and combinatorial interpretations through lattice paths, overpartitions, and tilings, and provide a combinatorial proof demonstrating that these numbers form a log-concave and unimodal sequence.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of 4-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a lattice in n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as the chromatic number of its Voronoi graph. The Voronoi graph is the Cayley graph on the lattice having the strict Voronoi vectors as generators. In this paper we determine the chromatic number of all 4-dimensional lattices. To achieve this we use the known classification of 52 parallelohedra in dimension 4. These 52 geometric types yield 16 combinatorial types of relevant Voronoi graphs. We discuss a systematic approach to checking for isomorphism of Cayley graphs of lattices. Lower bounds for the chromatic number are obtained from choosing appropriate small finite induced subgraphs of the Voronoi graphs. Matching upper bounds are derived from periodic colorings. To determine the chromatic numbers of these finite graphs, we employ a SAT solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by applications in the natural, social and computer sciences several algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all sets $X\s V$ of vertices of a graph $G=(V,E)$ that induce a {\it connected} subgraph. We offer two algorithms for enumerating all $X$'s that induce (more exquisite) {\it metric} subgraphs. Specifically, the first algorithm, called {\tt AllMetricSets}, generates these $X$'s in a compressed format. The second algorithm generates all (accessible) metric sets one-by-one but is provably output-polynomial. Mutatis mutandis the same holds for the geodesically-convex sets $X\s V$, this being a natural strengthening of "metric". The Mathematica command {\tt BooleanConvert} features prominently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The independent set sequence of trees has been well studied, with much effort devoted to the (still open) question of Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s on whether the independent set sequence of a tree is always unimodal.
  Much less attention has been given to the independent set sequence of hypertrees. Here we study some natural first questions in this realm. We show that the strong independent set sequences of linear hyperpaths and of linear hyperstars are unimodal (actually, log-concave). For uniform linear hyperpaths we obtain explicit expressions for the number of strong independent sets of each possible size, both via generating functions and via combinatorial arguments. We also show log-concavity of the strong independent set sequences of uniform linear hypercombs.</description>

Abstract: We give a combinatorial proof of an identity that involves Eulerian numbers and was obtained algebraically by Brenti and Welker (2009). To do so, we study alcoved triangulations of dilated hypersimplices. As a byproduct, we describe the dual graph of the triangulation in the case of the standard simplex, conjecture its structure for general hypersimplices, and prove combinatorially that the Eulerian numbers coincide with the normalized volumes of the hypersimplices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given graph $G$, we aim to determine the possible realizable spectra for a generalized (or sometimes referred to as a weighted) Laplacian matrix associated with $G$. This new specialized inverse eigenvalue problem is considered for certain families of graphs and graphs on a small number of vertices. Related considerations include studying the possible ordered multiplicity lists associated with stars and complete graphs and graphs with a few vertices. Finally, we present a novel investigation, both theoretically and numerically, the minimum variance over a family of generalized Laplacian matrices with a size-normalized weighting.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of degenerate Tur\'{a}n problems in $p$-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive real number $p$, the $p$-norm $\left\lVert G \right\rVert_p$ of a graph $G$ is the sum of the $p$-th powers of all vertex degrees. We study the maximum $p$-norm $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$ of $F$-free graphs on $n$ vertices, focusing on the case where $F$ is a bipartite graph. The case $p = 1$ corresponds to the classical degenerate Tur\'{a}n problem, which has yielded numerous results indicating that extremal constructions tend to exhibit certain pseudorandom properties. In contrast, results such as those by Caro--Yuster, Nikiforov, and Gerbner suggest that for large $p$, extremal constructions often display a star-like structure.
  It is natural to conjecture that for every bipartite graph $F$, there exists a threshold $p_F$ such that for $p&lt; p_{F}$, the order of $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$ is governed by pseudorandom constructions, while for $p &gt; p_{F}$, it is governed by star-like constructions. We confirm this conjecture by determining the exact value of $p_{F}$, under a mild assumption on the growth rate of $\mathrm{ex}(n,F)$. Our results extend to $r$-uniform hypergraphs as well.
  We also prove a general upper bound that is tight up to a $\log n$ factor for $\mathrm{ex}_{p}(n,F)$ when $p = p_{F}$. We conjecture that this $\log n$ factor is unnecessary and prove this conjecture for several classes of well-studied bipartite graphs, including one-side degree-bounded graphs and families of short even cycles.
  Our proofs involve $p$-norm adaptions of fundamental tools from degenerate Tur\'{a}n problems, including the Erd\H{o}s--Simonovits Regularization Theorem and the Dependent Random Choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present algebraic results concerning the combined matrices $\mathcal{C}(A)$, where the entries of $A$ belong to a number field $K$ and $A$ is a non-singular matrix. In other words, $A$ is a $n\times n$ matrix belonging to the General Linear Group over $K$, denoted by $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. We also analyze the case in which matrix $A$ belongs to algebraic subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$, such as the unimodular group, where $A^2$ is a $n\times n$ matrix belonging to the Special Linear Group, denoted by $\mathrm{SL}_n(K)$, triangular groups, diagonal groups, among others. In particular, we thouroughly examine the cases $n=2$ and $n=3$ for symmetric and non-symmetric matrices, providing explicit diagonalization of $\mathcal{C}(A)$, which includes characteristic polynomials with their eigenvalues and eigenfactors.</description>

      <title>Deficiency of chemical reaction networks: The effect of operations that preserve multistationarity and periodic orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate six operations on chemical reaction networks, all of which have been proven to preserve important dynamical properties, namely, the capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity (multiple steady states) and periodic orbits. Both multistationarity and periodic orbits are properties that are known to be precluded when the deficiency (a nonnegative integer associated to a network) is zero. It is therefore natural to conjecture that the deficiency never decreases when any of the six aforementioned network operations are performed. We prove that this is indeed the case, and moreover, we characterize the numerical difference in deficiency after performing each network operation.</description>

      <title>Dispersion on the Complete Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. At the beginning of each time step, for every vertex inhabited by at least two particles, each of these particles moves independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle.
  Cooper et al. showed that when the underlying graph is the complete graph on~$n$ vertices, then there is a phase transition when the number of particles $M = n/2$. They showed that if $M&lt;(1-\varepsilon)n/2$ for some fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then the process finishes in a logarithmic number of steps, while if $M&gt;(1+\varepsilon)n/2$, an exponential number of steps are required with high probability. Here we provide a thorough asymptotic analysis of the dispersion time around criticality, where $\varepsilon = o(1)$, and describe the transition from logarithmic to exponential time. As a consequence of our results we establish, for example, that the dispersion time is in probability and in expectation in $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ when $|\varepsilon| = O(n^{-1/2})$, and provide qualitative bounds for its tail behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The height of a poset $P$ is the supremum of the cardinalities of chains in $P$. The exact formula for the height of the subgroup lattice of the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_n$ is known, as is an accurate asymptotic formula for the height of the subsemigroup lattice of the full transformation monoid $\mathcal{T}_n$. Motivated by the related question of determining the heights of the lattices of left- and right congruences of $\mathcal{T}_n$, we develop a general method for computing the heights of lattices of both one- and two-sided congruences for semigroups. We apply this theory to obtain exact height formulae for several monoids of transformations, matrices and partitions, including: the full transformation monoid $\mathcal{T}_n$, the partial transformation monoid $\mathcal{PT}_n$, the symmetric inverse monoid $\mathcal{I}_n$, the monoid of order-preserving transformations $\mathcal{O}_n$, the full matrix monoid $\mathcal{M}(n,q)$, the partition monoid $\mathcal{P}_n$, the Brauer monoid $\mathcal{B}_n$ and the Temperley-Lieb monoid $\mathcal{TL}_n$.</description>

      <title>On diagonal digraphs, Koszul algebras and triangulations of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the magnitude homology of digraphs, with a primary focus on diagonal digraphs, i.e., digraphs whose magnitude homology is concentrated on the diagonal. For any digraph $G$, we provide a complete description of the second magnitude homology ${\rm MH}_{2,k}(G)$. This allows us to define a combinatorial condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_\ell)$, which is equivalent to the vanishing of ${\rm MH}_{2,k}(G, \mathbb{Z})$ for all $k &gt; \ell$. In particular, diagonal digraphs satisfy $(\mathcal{V}_2)$. As a corollary, we obtain that the 2-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal undirected graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field, and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. To provide a source of examples of digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a pure simplicial complex $K$. For a triangulation $K$ of a topological manifold $M$, we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ in terms of the homology of $M$. As a corollary, we obtain that if $K$ is a triangulation of a closed manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

Abstract: A loop is a generic immersion of the circle in a surface, considered up to isotopy. A loop is taut when it is minimally intersecting in its homotopy class. A pinning set of a loop is a set of points $P$ in the surface avoiding the loop, such that the loop is taut in the surface punctured at $P$. The collection of pinning sets forms a poset under inclusion, endowed with the cardinal function: its minimum defines the pinning number of the loop.
  We show that the decision problem associated to computing the pinning number of a plane loop is NP-complete. First, we implement a polynomial algorithm to check if a point-set is pinning, adapting a method of Birman--Series for computing intersection numbers of curves in surfaces. Then we reduce the problem to a boolean formula whose solutions correspond to pinning sets: for this we study immersed discs in detail to improve a theorem of Hass--Scott characterising taut loops, and apply an algorithm of Blanc and Frish. Finally, we reduce the vertex-cover problem for graphs to an instance of the pinning problem for plane loops.</description>

Abstract: Based on a classical result on partitions of an integer into a finite set of positive integers, we establish a general positivity result on coefficients of certain $q$-series which uniformly refines the positivity of truncated pentagonal number series, truncated Gauss' identities and some special cases of truncated Jacobi triple product identity. As an application, we prove two positivity conjectures due to Merca.</description>

      <title>Restriction estimates using decoupling theorems and two-ends Furstenberg inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to study the restriction conjecture using decoupling theorems and two-ends Furstenberg inequalities. Specifically, we pose a two-ends Furstenberg conjecture, which implies the restriction conjecture. As evidence, we prove this conjecture in the plane by using the Furstenberg set estimate. Moreover, we use this planar result to prove a restriction estimate for $p&gt;22/7$ in three dimensions, which implies Wolff's $5/2$-hairbrush bound for Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Our approach also makes improvements for the restriction conjecture in higher dimensions.</description>
