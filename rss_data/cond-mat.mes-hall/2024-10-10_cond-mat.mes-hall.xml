      <title>Topological characterization of a non-Hermitian ladder via Floquet non-Bloch theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a non-Hermitian (NH) ladder subjected to a variety of driving protocols. The driven system looses chiral symmetry (CS) whose presence is indispensable for its topological characterization. Further, the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) gets adversely affected due to the presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we present a formalism that not only retrieves the lost CS, but also restores the BBC via the construction of a generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). Specifically, we employ delta and step drives to compare and contrast between them with regard to their impact on NHSE. Further, a widely studied harmonic drive is invoked in this context, not only for the sake of completeness, but its distinct computational framework offers valuable insights on the properties of out-of-equilibrium systems. While the delta and the harmonic drives exhibit unidirectional skin effect in the system, the step drive may show bi-directional skin effect. Also, there are specific points in the parameter space that are devoid of skin effect. These act as critical points that distinguish the skin modes to be localized at one boundary or the other. Moreover, for the computation of the non-Bloch invariants, we employ GBZ via a pair of symmetric time frames corresponding to the delta and the step drives, while a high-frequency expansion was carried out to deal with the harmonic drive. Finally, we present phase boundary diagrams that demarcate distinct NH phases obtained via tracking the trajectories of the exceptional points. These diagrams demonstrate a co-existence of the zero and $\pi$ energy modes in the strong NH limit and thus may be relevant for studies of Floquet time crystals.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Only Spin-Orbit Qubits in Silicon and Germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong spin-orbit interaction in silicon and germanium hole quantum dots enables all-electric microwave control of single spins but is unsuited for multi-spin exchange-only qubits that rely on scalable discrete signals to suppress cross-talk and heating effects in large quantum processors. Here, we propose an exchange-only spin-orbit qubit that utilizes spin-orbit interactions to implement qubit gates and keeps the beneficial properties of the original encoding. Our encoding is robust to significant local variability in hole spin properties and, because it operates with two degenerate states, it eliminates the need for the rotating frame, avoiding the technologically demanding constraints of fast clocks and precise signal calibration. Unlike current exchange-only qubits, which require complex multi-step sequences prone to leakage, our qubit design enables low-leakage two-qubit gates in a single step, addressing critical challenges in scaling spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Slow Equilibrium Relaxation in a Chiral Magnet Mediated by Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a pump-probe experiment on the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ to study the relaxation dynamics of its non-collinear magnetic orders, employing a millisecond magnetic field pulse as the pump and resonant elastic x-ray scattering as the probe. Our findings reveal that the system requires $\sim$0.2 s to stabilize after the perturbation applied to both the conical and skyrmion lattice phase; significantly slower than the typical nanosecond timescale observed in micromagnetics. This prolonged relaxation is attributed to the formation and slow dissipation of local topological defects, such as emergent monopoles. By unveiling the experimental lifetime of these emergent singularities in a non-collinear magnetic system, our study highlights a universal relaxation mechanism in solitonic textures within the slow dynamics regime, offering new insights into topological physics and advanced information storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Effective particles in a multishell nanostructure with hardcore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-medium effective carriers with position-dependent mass in a multishell heterostructure are analytically studied. We obtain the exact spectrum of three-dimensional bound eigenstates and the scattering wave-functions for several von Roos ordering classes. Ascribing a continuously varying mass to the carriers in a multilayer type spherical system we use our solutions to compute optical properties such as the absorption coefficients and refraction indices of a nanometric heterostructure. We analyze in detail the case of a GaAs/Al-GaAs alloy and show how these results depend on the ordering class of the kinetic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Gapped Dirac materials and quantum valley currents in dual-gated hBN/bilayer-graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gapped Dirac materials, the topological current associated with each valley can flow in opposite directions creating long-range charge-neutral valley currents. We report valley currents in hBN/bilayer-graphene heterostructures with an energy gap, which is tunable by a perpendicular electric (displacement) field in a dual-gated structure. We observed significant nonlocal resistance, consistent with the scaling theory of the valley Hall effect. In the low-temperature limit, the nonlocal resistance approaches a saturated value near the "quantum limit," indicating the emergence of quantum valley currents.</description>

      <title>Bilayer Graphene on hexagonal Boron Nitride and the Family of quantum MetaMaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the fabrication and characterization of dual-gated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/bilayer-graphene (BLG) superlattices. Due to the moire effect, the hBN/BLG superlattice harbors an energy gap at the charge neutral point (CNP) and the satellites even without a perpendicular electric field. In BLG, moreover, the application of a perpendicular electric field tunes the energy gap, which contrasts with the single-layer graphene (SLG) and is linked to the family of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Therefore, the hBN/BLG superlattice is accompanied with non-trivial energy-band topology and a narrow energy band with van Hove singularities. By the dual gating, systematic engineering of the energy-band structure can be performed and the carrier concentration is fine-tunable. This review is an extended version of the talk based on ref. [1], which is also a supplementary to the ref. T. Iwasaki, Y. Morita, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, Phys. Rev. B106, 165134 (2022) and Phys. Rev. B109, 075409 (2024). The data show the universality and diversity in the physics of the hBN/BLG superlattices.</description>

      <title>Tunable high Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall effect through interlayer ferromagnetic coupling in two-dimensional ferromagnet NiSbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is significant and fascinating due to the presence of multiple dissipationless chiral edge states. Here, we predict that monolayer NiSbO3 possesses the Chern number C = 3, confirmed by the anomalous Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The magnetic anisotropic energy (MAE) responsible for ferromagnetic order is 0.641 meV originating from Ni-d and Sb-p orbitals, where the contributed MAE from same spin-up channels predominates. In forward electric fields, the negative MAE makes the easy magnetization direction perpendicular to the surface, which is conducive to the realizing of high Chern-number QAHE. The simulated Curie temperature is 291 K. Intriguingly, in a bilayer, the obtained C = 6 is twice that of the monolayer, thanking to the interlayer ferromagnetic coupling. Our work offers a promising candidate for potential applications in topological quantum devices and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Magnon confinement in a nanomagnonic waveguide by a magnetic Moir\'e superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of moir\'e superlattices has revealed intriguing phenomena in electronic systems, including unconventional superconductivity and ferromagnetism observed in magic-angle bilayer graphene. This approach has recently been adapted to the field of magnonics. In this Letter, we investigate the confinement of spin waves in a nanomagnonic waveguide integrated on top of a magnetic moir\'e superlattice. Our numerical analysis reveals a magnonic flat-band at the centre of the Brillouin zone, created by a 3.5 degrees twist in the moir\'e superlattice. The flat-band, characterized by a high magnon density of states and a zero group velocity, allows for the confinement of magnons within the AB stacking region. The flat-band results from the mode anticrossing of several different magnon bands, covering a wavevector range of nearly 40 rad/{\mu}m and a 166 nm wide spatial distribution of the magnon trapping in the waveguide. Our results pave the way for nanomagnonic devices and circuits based on spin-wave trapping in magnon waveguides.</description>

      <title>Hot electron lifetime exceeds 300 nanoseconds in quantum dots with high quantum efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot electrons are theoretically predicted to be long-lived in strongly confined quantum dots, which could play vital roles in quantum dot-based optoelectronics; however, existing photoexcitation transient spectroscopy investigations reveal that their lifetime is less than 1 ps in well-passivated quantum dots because of the ultrafast electron-hole Auger-assisted cooling. Therefore, they are generally considered absent in quantum dot optoelectronic devices. Here, by using our newly developed electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we surprisingly observed abundant hot electrons in both II-VI and III-VI compound quantum dot light-emitting diodes at elevated bias (&gt;4 V), of which the lifetimes reach 59 to 371 ns, lengthened by more than 5 orders of magnitude compared with the photoexcited hot electrons. These results experimentally prove the presence of a strong phonon bottleneck effect, refreshing our understanding of the role of hot electrons in quantum dot optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Room- and low-temperature magnetic parameters of Y$_3$AlFe$_4$O$_{12}$ garnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic properties of Y$_3$AlFe$_4$O$_{12}$ garnet ceramics have been studied over a wide range of temperature ($3-370$ K) and magnetic fields (up to $2$ kOe). Effects of varying the temperature on some of the application-specific magnetic characteristics have been analyzed in detail. With the decrease in temperature, the effective anisotropy constant, $K_{Eff}$, is found to sharply rise below $\sim150$ K, while the saturation magnetization, $M_s$, changes only slightly ($&lt;20\%$ within $3-250$ K). The exchange stiffness, $A_{ex}$, and spin wave stiffness, $D$, parameters mirror the relatively smooth behavior of the magnetization at low temperatures but display a rapid drop when $T$ approaches $T_C\approx436$ K. The temperature dependence of the domain wall thickness and the critical single-domain size correlate with the corresponding values for pure Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and are in agreement with the theoretical estimates. We conclude by discussing the ways of how to use the obtained results for tailoring the magnetic properties of YIG-based materials for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Unified model for non-Abelian braiding of Majorana and Dirac fermion zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are the most intensively studied non-Abelian anyons. The Dirac fermion zero modes in topological insulators can be interpreted as the symmetry-protected "doubling" of the MZMs, suggesting an intrinsic connection between the quantum statistics of the two types of zero modes. Here we find that the minimal Kitaev chain model provides a unified characterization of the non-Abelian braiding statistics of both the MZMs and Dirac fermion zero modes under different parameter regimes. In particular, we introduce a minimal tri-junction setting based on the minimal Kitaev chain model and show it facilitates the unified scheme of braiding Dirac fermion zero modes, as well as the MZMs in the assistance of a Dirac mode. This unified minimal model unveils that the non-Abelian braiding of the MZMs can be continuously extended to the realm of Dirac fermion zero modes. The present study reveals deeper insights into the non-Abelian statistics and enables a broader search for non-Abelian anyons beyond the scope of MZMs.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian Dirac cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic quasiparticle excitations arising from band degeneracies in crystals not only offer exciting chances to test hypotheses in particle physics but also play crucial roles in the transport and topological properties of materials and metamaterials. Quasiparticles are commonly described by low-energy Hamiltonians that are Hermitian, while non-Hermiticity is usually considered detrimental to quasiparticle physics. In this work, we show that such an assumption of Hermiticity can be lifted to bring quasiparticles into non-Hermitian systems. We propose a concrete lattice model containing two non-Hermitian Dirac cones, with one hosting amplifying Dirac quasiparticles and the other hosting decaying ones. The lifetime contrast between the Dirac cones at the two valleys imposes an ultra-strong valley selection rule not seen in any Hermitian systems: only one valley can survive in the long time limit regardless of the excitation, lattice shape and other details. This property leads to an effective parity anomaly with a single Dirac cone and offers a simple way to generate vortex states in the massive case. The non-Hermitian feature of the bulk Dirac cones can also be generalized to the boundary, giving rise to valley kink states with valley-locked lifetimes. This makes the kink states effectively unidirectional and more resistant against inter-valley scattering. All these phenomena are experimentally demonstrated in a non-Hermitian electric circuit lattice.</description>

      <title>Persistent flat band splitting and strong selective band renormalization in a kagome magnet thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome materials provide a fascinating playground for exploring the interplay of magnetism, correlation and topology. Many magnetic kagome systems have been reported including the binary FemXn (X=Sn, Ge; m:n = 3:1, 3:2, 1:1) family and the rare earth RMn6Sn6 (R = rare earth) family, where their kagome flat bands are calculated to be near the Fermi level in the paramagnetic phase. While partially filling a kagome flat band is predicted to give rise to a Stoner-type ferromagnetism, experimental visualization of the magnetic splitting across the ordering temperature has not been reported for any of these systems due to the high ordering temperatures, hence leaving the nature of magnetism in kagome magnets an open question. Here, we probe the electronic structure with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a kagome magnet thin film FeSn synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy. We identify the exchange-split kagome flat bands, whose splitting persists above the magnetic ordering temperature, indicative of a local moment picture. Such local moments in the presence of the topological flat band are consistent with the compact molecular orbitals predicted in theory. We further observe a large spin-orbital selective band renormalization in the Fe d_xy+d_(x^2-y^2 ) spin majority channel reminiscent of the orbital selective correlation effects in the iron-based superconductors. Our discovery of the coexistence of local moments with topological flat bands in a kagome system echoes similar findings in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, and provides a basis for theoretical effort towards modeling correlation effects in magnetic flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Persistent versus dissipative Peltier effect in a topological quantum thermocouple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect on the thermoelectric properties of three-terminal quantum devices is investigated. Thermodynamic relations among the linear-response coefficients of these devices are derived and interpreted. General expressions are derived using nonequilibrium Green's functions, and applied to calculate the thermoelectric response of a model quantum thermocouple. It is shown that the AB effect can generate a large thermoelectric response in a device with particle-hole symmetry, which nominally has zero Seebeck and Peltier coefficients. In addition to modifying the external electric and thermal currents of the device, the AB effect also induces persistent electric and thermal currents. One might expect that a persistent electric current in a quantum thermocouple, through the Peltier effect, could lead to persistent Peltier cooling, violating the 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics. However, this apparent paradox is resolved by elucidating the distinction between persistent and dissipative currents in quantum thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Electric field driven spin textures in heavy fermion van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered van der Waals material CeSiI exhibits both heavy fermion behavior and spiral order with strong magnetic anisotropy which makes it a potential host for topological spin textures such as skyrmions through electrical gating. A monolayer of CeSiI consists of two layers of Ce atoms on triangular lattices that sandwich a silicene layer. Motivated by the experiments, we explore magnetic phase diagram in van der Waals heavy fermion materials as a function of anisotropy and applied magnetic field using an effective spin model. We demonstrate that application of an external electric field can tune the Kondo coupling on each Ce layer differently, in turn allowing for controlling the intra- and interlayer magnetic couplings. Our analysis indicates that this fine-tuning leads to the coexistence of different magnetic orders in a single monolayer. In particular, we show that a novel vortex phase can be stabilized only in the presence of an external electric field. Our results highlight the unique advantages and the tunability of van der Waals heavy fermion materials for manipulation of chiral magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Gating graphene with a semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals are commonly used as electrostatic gates in devices due to their abundant charge carrier densities that are necessary for efficient charging and discharging. A semiconducting gate can be beneficial for certain fabrication processes, in low light conditions, and for specific gating properties. Here, we determine the effectiveness and limitations of a semiconducting gate in graphene and bilayer graphene devices. Using the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), we show that these semiconductors can be used to suitably gate the graphene devices for certain operating conditions. For singly gated devices, we find that the semiconducting gates provide gating characteristics comparable with metallic gates below liquid helium temperatures but include resistivity features resulting from gate voltage clamping of the MoS$_2$. A 1D potential model is developed that corroborates the clamping effect observed in the measurements. In doubly gated devices, we pin down the parameter range of effective operation and show that the semiconducting depletion regime results in clamping and hysteresis from defect state charge trapping. Our results provide a guide for the appropriate operating conditions for employing semiconducting gates and open the door to novel device architectures.</description>

      <title>Coulomb blockade in open superconducting islands on InAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons in closed systems can exhibit Coulomb blockade (CB) oscillations due to charge quantization. Here, we report CB oscillations in aluminum superconducting islands on InAs nanowires in the open regime. The Al island is connected to the source/drain leads through two contacts: One is fully transmitting while the other is tuned into the tunneling regime. This device configuration is typical for tunneling spectroscopy where charging energy is generally considered negligible. The oscillation periods are 2$e$ or 1$e$, depending on the gate settings. A magnetic field can induce the 2$e$ to 1$e$ transition. Our result is reminiscent of the "mesoscopic Coulomb blockade" in open quantum dots caused by electron interference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) host topological phases of matter protected by crystal symmetries. Topological surface states in three-dimensional TCIs have been predicted and observed in IV-VI SnTe-class semiconductors. Despite the prediction of a two-dimensional (2D) TCI characterized by two pairs of edge states inside the bulk gap, materials challenges have thus far prevented its experimental realization. Here we report the growth and characterization of bilayer SnTe on the 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ substrate by molecular beam epitaxy and scanning tunneling microscopy. We experimentally observe two anticorrelated, periodically modulated pairs of conducting edge states along the perimeters of the sample with a large band gap exceeding $0.2$ eV. We identify these states with a 2D TCI through first principles calculations. Finally, we probe the coupling of adjacent topological edge states and demonstrate the resulting energy shift driven by a combination of electrostatic interactions and tunneling coupling. Our work opens the door to investigations of tunable topological states in 2D TCIs, of potential impact for spintronics and nanoelectronics applications at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Spin Quenching and Transport by Hidden Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit interactions, \textit{e.g.}, dipolar and exchange couplings, usually govern magnetization dynamics. Some interactions may be hidden from the global crystal symmetry. We report that in a large class of \textit{uniaxial} antiferromagnets, a \textit{hidden} Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with retaining global inversion symmetry quenches the spin of magnon along the N\'eel vector ${\bf n}$, thus forbidding its angular-momentum flow. Some magnon spins, termed ``nodal" and ``corner" spins, survive when they distribute \textit{singularly} at the hot spots, i.e., high-symmetric degeneracy points in the Brillouin zone, and are protected by crystal symmetries. The biased magnetic field along ${\bf n}$ broadens such distributions, allowing bulk spin transport with unique signatures in the magnetic field and temperature dependencies. This explains recent experiments and highlights the role of hidden interaction.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast momentum-resolved visualization of the interplay between phonon-mediated scattering and plasmons in graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering between individual charges and collective modes in materials governs fundamental phenomena such as electrical resistance, energy dissipation, switching between different phases, and ordering. The study of such scattering requires a simultaneous access to the ultrafast momentum-resolved dynamics of single-particle and collective excitations, which remains as an experimental challenge. Here, we demonstrate time- and momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy, and apply it to graphite showing that large ($\Delta q\simeq$1.2~{\AA}$^{-1}$) photoexcited electron-hole (e-h) pockets in the band structure induce a renormalization of the collective in-plane and bulk plasmons that can be described quantitatively by invoking intra- and inter-valley scattering processes mediated by $E_{2g}$ and $A_{1}'$ phonon modes, which we directly observe by ultrafast electron diffraction and identify via ab initio calculations. Conversely, the photoexcitation of smaller e-h pockets ($\Delta q\simeq$0.7~{\AA}$^{-1}$) close to the K point of graphite results in the renormalization of in-plane plasmons, which can only be partially explained by phonon-mediated scattering and thermal expansion. Our results show the importance of combining momentum- and time-resolved information to elucidate microscopic details associated with electronic scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Classification of Higher-Order Van Hove Singularities in Kagome Topological Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in band structures featuring higher-order Van Hove singularities (HOVHS), we investigate a spinless fermion kagome system characterized by nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping amplitudes. While NN hopping preserves time-reversal symmetry, NNN hopping, akin to chiral hopping on the Haldane lattice, breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to the formation of topological bands with Chern numbers ranging from $C = \pm 1$ to $C = \pm 4$. We perform analytical and numerical analysis of the energy bands near the high-symmetry points $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}$, $\pm \boldsymbol{K}$, and $\boldsymbol{M_i}$ ($i=1,2,3$), which uncover a rich and complex landscape of HOVHS, controlled by the magnitude and phase of the NNN hopping. We observe power-law divergences in the density of states (DOS), $\rho(\epsilon) \sim |\epsilon|^{-\nu}$, with exponents $\nu = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4$, which can significantly affect the anomalous Hall response at low temperatures when the Fermi level crosses the HOVHS. Additionally, the NNN hopping induces the formation of higher Chern number bands $C = \pm 2, \pm 4$ in the middle of the spectrum obeying a sublattice interference whereupon electronic states are maximally localized in each of the sublattices when the momentum approaches the three high-symmetry points $\boldsymbol{M_i}$ ($i=1,2,3$) on the Brillouin zone boundary. This classification of HOVHS in kagome systems provides a platform to explore unconventional electronic orders induced by electronic correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a nanoelectromechanical setup which generates a particular type of motion - the circular motion of mesoscopic superconducting grain, where motion is described by entangled nanomechanical coherent states. The setup is based on mesoscopic terminal utilizing the AC Josephson effect between the superconducting electrodes and the grain, operating in the regime of the Cooper pair box controlled by the gate voltage. The grain is placed on the free end of the suspended cantilever, performing controlled two-dimensional mechanical vibrations. Required functionality is achieved by operating two external parameters, bias voltage between the superconducting electrodes and voltage between gate electrodes, by which the nanomechanical coherent states are formed and organised in a pair of entangled cat-states in two perpendicular spatial directions which evolve in time in the way to provide a circular motion.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent surface superconductivity in time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals host topologically protected surface states, the so-called Fermi arcs, that have a penetration depth into the bulk that depends on surface-momentum, and diverges at the Weyl points. It has recently been observed in PtBi2 that such Fermi arc states can become superconducting, with a critical temperature larger than that of the bulk. Here we introduce a general variational method that captures the interplay between surface and bulk superconductivity, for any bulk Hamiltonian that harbors (topological) surface states with varying penetration depth. From the self-consistent solutions we establish that the surface state localization length of Weyl semimetals leads to characteristic features in the surface superconductivity, with a gap depending on surface momentum and a penetration length for the order parameter that is temperature-dependent due to competition with the bulk superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multi-layer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. We argue that a chiral spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of the chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion, i.e., the non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multi-layer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

Abstract: Atomistic model calculations recently revealed that the polarization pattern at the cross-section through nanoscale ferroelectric nanodomains in rhombohedral barium titanate shows a clear antiskyrmion attributes such as the net invariant topological charge of minus two. The present work confirms that these topological defects also exist as local minima in the discretized Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire model, which is widely used in the phase-field modeling studies. We explore by phase-field simulations how an electric field can be used to create or move antiskyrmions within a monodomain ferroelectric matrix. The process of the field-induced antiskyrmion annihilation reveals the existence of a discrete ladder of intermediate antiskyrmion states with distinct radii but common symmetry, topology and geometrical properties.</description>

      <title>Observation of Rydberg excitons in monolayer MoS2 at room temperature by Imbert-Fedorov shift spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising platform for investigating the properties of open quantum systems, thanks to their large binding energies(hundreds of meV). However, the study of Rydberg excitons in TMDs has been hindered by sample quality limitations, strong background signals from ground excitons, and broadening at room temperature. In this work, we report the first observation of multiple Rydberg exciton states in monolayer MoS2 at room temperature using Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shift spectroscopy. By numerically solving the Schrodinger equation, we extracted the quasiparticle band gaps for A and B excitons, confirming the temperature-induced redshift of the band gap, in excellent agreement with previous results. Our findings establish IF shift spectroscopy as a powerful tool for characterizing Rydberg excitons in TMDs, paving the way for potential applications in quantum manipulation and control.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present results of our recent work of epitaxially-grown aluminum (epi-Al) on antimonide heterostructures, where the epi-Al thin film is grown at either room temperature or below zero $^o$C. A sharp superconducting transition at $T \sim 1.3$ K is observed in these epi-Al films, and the critical magnetic field follows the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) model. We further show that supercurrent states are achieved in Josephson junctions fabricated in the epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures with mobility $\mu \sim 1.0 \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs, making these heterostructures a promising platform for the exploration of Josephson junction effects for quantum microelectronics applications, and the realization of robust topological superconducting states that potentially allow the realization of intrinsically fault-tolerant qubits and quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Phase field crystal modelling of deformation assisted precipitation in binary alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the process of precipitation in binary alloys in the presence of mechanical deformation. It is commonly observed that mechanical deformation prior to or during precipitation leads to microstructure with excess defects, which allows for enhanced precipitate nucleation and growth rates. To investigate this phenomenon, we employ a two-dimensional phase-field crystal alloy model endowed with a temperature dependent mobility, making it capable of recovering isothermal transformation (TTT) diagrams with a characteristic inflection point (nose) about a critical temperature. We examine the variation in the time-scale of precipitation and its connection to the time-scale of the applied deformation, focusing on the roles of atomic defects in the processes involved. Our results indicate that precipitation is initially delayed through application of a deformation until a critical strain is achieved, beyond which precipitation proceeds more rapidly, assisted by plastic deformation such as grain boundary buckling or dislocation nucleation. We show that the evolution of the precipitated fraction, $f(t)$, departs from classical Avrami behaviour. Specifically, $df/dt$ develops two peaks indicative of a ``plateau"-like inflection in $f(t)$, signalling the transition to defect assisted precipitate nucleation. We analyze these plateaus as a function of the deformation rate and demonstrate that the they exhibit a discontinuous bifurcation as the time-scale of applied deformation is increased. These findings are compared to and found to be consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Broken intrinsic symmetry induced magnon-magnon coupling in synthetic ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets offer rich magnon energy spectra in which optical and acoustic magnon branches can hybridize. Here, we demonstrate a broken intrinsic symmetry induced coupling of acoustic and optical magnons in a synthetic ferrimagnet consisting of two dissimilar antiferromagnetically interacting ferromagnetic metals. Two distinct magnon modes hybridize at degeneracy points, as indicated by an avoided level-crossing. The avoided level-crossing gap depends on the interlayer exchange interaction between the magnetic layers, which can be controlled by adjusting the non-magnetic interlayer thickness. An exceptionally large avoided level crossing gap of 6 GHz is revealed, exceeding the coupling strength that is typically found in other magnonic hybrid systems based on a coupling of magnons with photons or magnons and phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic control over the properties of low-dimensional materials with nanoscale precision is a long-sought goal. Mastering this capability has a transformative impact on the design of multifunctional electrical and optical devices. Here, we present an ion-assisted synthetic technique that enables precise control over the material composition and energy landscape of two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals. Our method transforms binary transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), like MoSe$_2$, into ternary MoS$_{2\alpha}$Se$_{2(1-{\alpha}})$ alloys with systematically adjustable compositions, ${\alpha}$. By piecewise assembly of the lateral, compositionally modulated MoS$_{2\alpha}$Se$_{2(1-{\alpha})}$ segments within 2D atomic layers, we present a synthetic pathway towards the realization of multi-compositional designer materials. Our technique enables the fabrication of complex structures with arbitrary boundaries, dimensions as small as 30 nm, and fully customizable energy landscapes. Our optical characterizations further showcase the potential for implementing tailored optoelectronics in these engineered 2D crystals.</description>

      <title>Vortex bound states in dimerized $\pi$-flux optical lattices: characterization, state preparation and current measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice models display bound states for repulsive interactions that smoothly connect to high-energy two-particle states of doubly occupied sites, namely doublons, for strong onsite interactions. In this work, we show that a distinct type of repulsively bound states, namely vortex bound states of two bosons, appear in dimerized square lattices pierced by a uniform $\pi$-flux for moderate interactions. By focusing on a ladder geometry as an illustrative example, we characterize their properties, including chirality-changing decay channels induced by flux detuning, and we develop protocols to perform state preparation in optical lattices via adiabatic sequences or recently developed current imprinting methods. Finally, we show how to measure currents and thus chirality by quenching the system onto isolated pairs of nearest-neighbor sites and then sampling the corresponding dynamics. These results can also provide an experimentally realistic strategy for state preparation and probing of chiral gapped many-body phases in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear optical response based on many-body GW-Bethe-Salpeter and Kadanoff-Baym approaches for two-dimensional layered semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of 2D layered semiconductors, including transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) of the form MX (M=Ga, In; X=S, Se, Te) exhibit exceptional nonlinear optical properties. The energetically most favorable crystal ordering for nonlinear response is the AB layer stacking, which breaks central inversion symmetry for an arbitrary number of layers, resulting in non-zero off-diagonal elements of the $\chi^{(2n')}$ tensor, $n'$ being a positive integer, for arbitrary thickness of the materials. We perform first-principles many-body calculations of bandstructures and linear and nonlinear optical responses of monolayer (ML) and bulk TMC crystals based on $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter and Kadanoff-Baym approaches in and out of equilibrium, respectively, while taking many-body band gap renormalization and excitonic effects into account. We develop a detailed analysis of the linear and nonlinear optical selection rules by means of group and representation theory. We observe the general trend that the lowest-energy excitons are dark in 2D ML TMCs whereas they are bright or mixed bright-dark in 3D bulk TMCs, which we attribute to the difference between spatially dependent screening in 2D and constant screening in 3D. In particular, we derive general formulas for the nonlinear optical response based on exciton states in semiconductor materials. We find anti-bound excitons in ML GaS, which we attribute to dominant exciton exchange interaction. We show that by choosing elements with larger mass and by reducing the detuning energy it is possible to increase the nonlinear response not only for $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$, responsible for SHG and third harmonic generation (THG), but also in general for $\chi^{(n)}$ nonlinear response with $n&gt;3$, giving rise to high harmonic generation (HHG) in 2D semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous size dependence of the coercivity of nanopatterned CrGeTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coercivity of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles typically decreases with the nanoparticle size and reaches zero when thermal fluctuations overcome the magnetic anisotropy. Here, we used SQUID-on-tip microscopy to investigate the coercivity of square-shaped CrGeTe3 nanoislands with a wide range of sizes and width-to-thickness aspect ratios. The results reveal an anomalous size-dependent coercivity, with smaller islands exhibiting higher coercivity. The nonconventional scaling of the coercivity in CrGeTe3 nanoislands was found to be inversely proportional to the island width and thickness (1 over wd). This scaling implies that the nanoisland magnetic anisotropy is proportional to the perimeter rather than the volume, suggesting a magnetic edge state. In addition, we observe that 1600 nm wide islands display multi-domain structures with zero net remnant field, corresponding to the magnetic properties of pristine CrGeTe3 flakes. Our findings highlight the significant influence of edge states on the magnetic properties of CrGeTe3 and deepen our understanding of low-dimensional magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabatic non-Abelian braiding on silicon photonic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Abelian braiding describes the exchange behavior of anyons, which can be leveraged to encode qubits for quantum computing. Recently, this concept has been realized in classical photonic and acoustic systems. However, these implementations are constrained by adiabatic conditions, necessitating long operation distances and impeding practical applications. Here, we conceive and demonstrate a shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of telecommunication light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises tri-layer silicon waveguides stacked and embedded in the SU-8 polymer, employing an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations and give rise to compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Remarkably, this achievement represents the most compact braiding apparatus ever reported, with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works. This work presents a feasible approach to accelerating adiabatic braiding evolutions, paving the way for compact, CMOS-compatible non-Abelian photonic devices.</description>

      <title>High proton conductivity through angstrom-porous titania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) crystals have attracted strong interest as a new class of proton conducting materials that can block atoms, molecules and ions while allowing proton transport through the atomically thin basal planes. Although 2D materials exhibit this perfect selectivity, the reported proton conductivities have been relatively low. Here we show that vacancy-rich titania monolayers are highly permeable to protons while remaining impermeable to helium with proton conductivity exceeding 100 S cm-2 at 200 C and surpassing targets set by industry roadmaps. The fast and selective proton transport is attributed to an extremely high density of titanium-atom vacancies (one per square nm), which effectively turns titania monolayers into angstrom-scale sieves. Our findings highlight the potential of 2D oxides as membrane materials for hydrogen-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Effect of dynamical electron correlations on the tunnelling magnetoresistance of Fe/MgO/Fe(001) junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06679v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the non-equilibrium Green's function technique to investigate the steady-state transport properties of an Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), focusing on the impact of dynamical electron correlations on the Fe $3d$ orbitals. By applying the rigid shift approximation, we extend the calculations from zero- to finite-bias in a simple and computationally efficient manner, obtaining the bias-dependent electronic structure and current-versus-voltage characteristic curve in both the parallel and antiparallel configurations. In particular, we find that dynamical electron correlation manifests as a reduction in the spin splitting of the Fe $3d_{z^2}$ state compared to DFT predictions and introduces a finite relaxation time. The impact of these effects on the transport properties, however, varies significantly between magnetic configurations. In the parallel configuration, the characteristic curves obtained with DFT and DMFT are similar, as the transport is mostly due to the coherent transmission of spin-up electrons through the MgO barrier. Conversely, in the antiparallel configuration, correlation effects become more significant, with DMFT predicting a sharp current increase due to bias-driven inelastic electron-electron scattering. As a consequence, DMFT gives a lower bias threshold for the suppression of the tunneling magnetoresistance ratio compared to DFT, matching experimental data more closely.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions at topological quantum criticality of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases at quantum criticality attract much attention recently. Here we numerically study the interaction-induced phase transitions at around the topological quantum critical points of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. This extended SSH model shows topological phase transitions between the topologically trivial and nontrivial critical phases when interaction is absent. So long as the interaction terms are turned on, the topologically nontrivial (trivial) critical phases are driven into topologically nontrivial (trivial) insulator phases with finite energy gaps. Particularly, we find the trivial insulator phase is further driven to the nontrivial insulator phase, through interaction-induced topological phase transition, although interaction generally is harmful to nontrivial topology. The stability of trivial insulator phase against interaction tends to vanish at the multicritical point that separates the trivial and nontrivial critical phases. Our work provides a concrete example for manifesting the impact of interaction on topological quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed investigation into the response of single BaTiO3 (BTO) nanocrystals under applied electric fields (E-field) using Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI). Our study reveals pronounced domain wall migration and expansion of a sample measure in situ under applied electric field. The changes are most prominent at the surface of the nanocrystal, where the lack of external strain allows greater domain wall mobility. The observed domain shifts are correlated to the strength and orientation of the applied E-field, following a side-by-side domain model from Suzana et al. Notably, we identified a critical voltage threshold at +10 V, which leads to irreversible structural changes, suggesting plastic deformation. The findings highlight how surface effects and intrinsic defects contribute to the enhanced dielectric properties of BTO at the nanoscale, in contrast to bulk materials, where strain limits domain mobility. These findings deepen our understanding of nanoscale dielectric behaviour and inform the design of advanced nanoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional heterostructures have been crucial in advancing optoelectronic devices utilizing van der Waals materials. Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, known for their unique optical properties, offer extensive possibilities for light-emitting devices. Recently, a memory-driven optical device, termed a Mem-emitter, was proposed using these monolayers atop dielectric substrates. The successful realization of such devices heavily depends on selecting the optimal substrate. Here, we report a pronounced memory effect in a MoSe$_2$/clinochlore device, evidenced by electric hysteresis in the intensity and energy of MoSe$_2$ monolayer emissions. This demonstrates both population-driven and transition-rate-driven Mem-emitter abilities. Our theoretical approach correlates these memory effects with internal state variables of the substrate, emphasizing that clinochlore layered structure is crucial for a robust and rich memory response. This work introduces a novel two-dimensional device with promising applications in memory functionalities, highlighting the importance of alternative insulators in fabricating van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Transient cooling phenomenon in two-dimensional materials is studied based on the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Using a heating laser pulse to heat the two-dimensional disk geometry under the environment temperature, after the heating laser is removed, our results show that the transient temperature could be lower than the environment temperature and this transient cooling phenomenon could only appear in the phonon hydrodynamic regime with sufficient normal-process and insufficient resistive-process. In addition, the possibility of this phenomenon observed by experiments is theoretically discussed by using the experimental parameters as the input of the phonon BTE. Results show that this transient cooling phenomenon could obviously appear in a single-layer suspended graphene disk with diameter $7~\mu$m in the temperature range of $50-150$ K. The present work could provide theoretical guidance for the future experimental proof of hydrodynamic phonon transport in two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Floquet engineering (QFE) seeks to generalize the control of quantum systems with classical external fields, widely known as Semi-Classical Floquet engineering (SCFE), to quantum fields. However, to faithfully capture the physics at arbitrary coupling, a gauge-invariant description of light-matter interaction in cavity-QED materials is required, which makes the Hamiltonian highly non-linear in photonic operators. We provide a non-perturbative truncation scheme of the Hamiltonian, which is valid or arbitrary coupling strength, and use it to investigate the role of light-matter correlations, which are absent in SCFE. We find that even in the high-frequency regime, light-matter correlations can be crucial, in particular for the topological properties of a system. As an example, we show that for a SSH chain coupled to a cavity, light-matter correlations break the original chiral symmetry of the chain, strongly affecting the robustness of its edge states. In addition, we show how light-matter correlations are imprinted in the photonic spectral function and discuss their relation with the topology of the bands.</description>

      <title>Impact of geometry on chemical analysis exemplified for photoelectron spectroscopy of black silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For smooth surfaces, chemical composition can be readily analyzed using various spectroscopic techniques, a prominent example is X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the relative proportions of the elements are mainly determined by the intensity ratio of the element-specific photoelectrons. However, this analysis becomes more complex for nanorough surfaces like black silicon (b-Si) due to the geometry's steep slopes, which mimic local variations in emission angles. In this study, we explicitly quantify this effect through an integral geometric analysis using Minkowski tensors, correlating XPS chemical data with topographical information from Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). This approach yields reliable estimates of layer thicknesses for nanorough surfaces. For b-Si, we found that the oxide layer is approximately 50% thicker than the native oxide layer on a standard Si wafer. This study underscores the significant impact of nanoscale geometries on chemical property analysis.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law for Time-Reversal-Odd Nonlinear Transport</title>

Abstract: Time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) nonlinear current response has been theoretically proposed and experimentally confirmed recently. However, the role of disorder scattering in the response, especially whether it contributes to the $\sigma_{xx}$-independent term, has not been clarified. In this work, we derive a general scaling law for this effect, which accounts for multiple scattering sources. We show that the nonlinear conductivity is generally a quartic function in $\sigma_{xx}$. Besides intrinsic contribution, extrinsic contributions from scattering also enter the zeroth order term, and their values can be comparable to or even larger than the intrinsic one. Terms beyond zeroth order are all extrinsic. Cubic and quartic terms must involve skew scattering and they signal competition between at least two scattering sources. The behavior of zeroth order extrinsic terms is explicitly demonstrated in a Dirac model. Our finding reveals the significant role of disorder scattering in $\mathcal{T}$-odd nonlinear transport, and establishes a foundation for analyzing experimental result.</description>

      <title>Universality of Quantum Phase Transitions in the Integer and Fractional Quantum Hall Regimes</title>

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phases emerge due to strong electronic interactions and are characterized by anyonic quasiparticles, each distinguished by unique topological parameters, fractional charge, and statistics. In contrast, the integer quantum Hall (IQH) effects can be understood from the band topology of non-interacting electrons. We report a surprising super-universality of the critical behavior across all FQH and IQH transitions. Contrary to the anticipated state-dependent critical exponents, our findings reveal the same critical scaling exponent $\kappa = 0.41 \pm 0.02$ and localization length exponent $\gamma = 2.4 \pm 0.2$ for fractional and integer quantum Hall transitions. From these, we extract the value of the dynamical exponent $z\approx 1$. We have achieved this in ultra-high mobility trilayer graphene devices with a metallic screening layer close to the conduction channels. The observation of these global critical exponents across various quantum Hall phase transitions was masked in previous studies by significant sample-to-sample variation in the measured values of $\kappa$ in conventional semiconductor heterostructures, where long-range correlated disorder dominates. We show that the robust scaling exponents are valid in the limit of short-range disorder correlations.</description>

Abstract: In spite of the interest in the two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) experimentally found at surfaces and interfaces, important uncertainties remain about the observed insulator--metal transitions (IMTs). Here we show how an explicit improper coupling of carrier sources with a relevant soft mode significantly affects the transition. The analysis presented here for 2DEGs at polar interfaces is based on group theory, Landau-Ginzburg theory, and illustrated with first-principles calculations for the prototypical case of the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, for which such a structural transition has recently been observed. This direct coupling implies that the appearance of the soft mode is always accompanied by carriers. For sufficiently strong coupling an avalanche-like first-order IMT is predicted.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of dual Shapiro steps in small Josephson junctions</title>

Abstract: Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions were predicted theoretically as the quantum dual to Josephson oscillations. A significant consequence of this prediction is the emergence of quantized current steps, so-called dual Shapiro steps, when synchronizing Bloch oscillations to an external microwave signal. These steps potentially enable a fundamental standard of current $I$, defined via the frequency $f$ of the external signal and the elementary charge $e$, $I=\pm n \times 2ef$, where $n$ is a natural number. Here, we realize this fundamental relation by synchronizing the Bloch oscillations in small Al/AlO$_\mathrm{x}$/Al Josephson junctions to sinusoidal drives with frequencies varying from $1$ to $6\:\mathrm{GHz}$ and observe dual Shapiro steps up to $I\approx 3 \: \mathrm{nA}$. Inspired by today's voltage standards and to further confirm the duality relation, we investigate a pulsed drive regime, which is dual to the single flux quantum mode of Josephson oscillations, and observe a similar asymmetric pattern of dual Shapiro steps. This work confirms quantum duality effects in Josephson junctions and paves the way towards a range of applications in quantum metrology based on well-established fabrication techniques and straightforward circuit design.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional honeycomb topological antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional systems with honeycomb lattice are known to be a paradigmatic platform to explore the various types of Hall effects, owing to that the interplay of lattice geometry, spin-orbit coupling and magnetism can give rise to very rich features in the quantum geometry of wave functions. In this work, we consider honeycomb topological antiferromagets that are effectively described by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic Kane-Mele model, and explore the evolution of its nonlinear Hall response with respect to the change of lattice anisotropy, chemical potential, and the direction of the N\'{e}el vector. Due to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the leading-order Hall effect of quantum geometric origin is the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, which is a second-order effect of electric fields and is independent of the scattering time. We investigate the behavior of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensor across topological phase transitions driven by antiferromagnetic exchange field and lattice anisotropy and find that its components do not change sign, which is different from the extrinsic nonlinear Hall effect. In the weakly doped regime, we find that the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect is valley-polarized. By varying the chemical potential, we find that the nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors exhibit kinks when the Fermi surface undergoes Lifshitz transitions. Furthermore, we find that the existence of spin-orbit coupling to lift the spin-rotation symmetry is decisive for the use of intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect to detect the direction of the N\'{e}el vector. Our work shows that the two-dimensional honeycomb topological antiferromagnets are an ideal class of material systems with rich properties for the study of intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Universal Role of Combined Symmetry for the Protection of the Dirac Cone in Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulators</title>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AF TIs) are predicted to exhibit exotic physical properties such as gigantic optical and topological magnetoelectric responses. While a key to achieving such phenomena relies on how to break the symmetry protecting the Dirac-cone surface state (SS) and acquire the mass of Dirac fermions, the mechanism has yet to be clarified. To address this issue, we carried out micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for GdBi hosting the type-II AF order, and uncovered the stripe-type 2$\times$1 reconstruction of the Fermi surface associated with the AF band folding. Intriguingly, in contrast to NdBi with the type-I AF order displaying the surface-selective Dirac-fermion mass, GdBi shows massless behavior irrespective of AF domains due to the robust topological protection. These results strongly suggest a crucial role of the ThetaTD (time-reversal and translational) symmetry to create the Dirac-fermion mass in AF TIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) with proximity-induced Ising and Rashba spin-orbit couplings (SOC) in the top layer, as recently achieved experimentally. Utilizing the Bistritzer-MacDonald model with SOCs, we reveal a rich single-particle topological phase diagram featuring topological flat bands across different twist angles and interlayer hopping energies. The evolution of Dirac cones and Chern numbers is examined to understand the topological phase transitions. We find that all phases can be achieved with an experimentally accessible SOC strength ($\sim$1 meV) in systems with angles very close to the magic angle. Furthermore, the van Hove singularity for each topological flat band splits in the presence of SOC, significantly altering the electronic properties. Additionally, we investigate the spin textures of each band in momentum space, discovering a skyrmion-like spin texture in the center of the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which is correlated with the topological phase transitions and can be tuned via the SOCs and an out-of-plane electric field. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the topological flat bands, establishing a foundation for grasping the intrinsic and rich roles of SOCs in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Drag conductance induced by neutral-mode localization in fractional quantum Hall junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A junction of two 2/3 fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edges, with no charge tunneling between them, may exhibit Anderson localization of neutral modes. Manifestations of such localization in transport properties of the junction are explored. There are two competing localization channels, ``neutral-mode superconductivity'' and ``neutral-mode backscattering''. Localization in any of these channels leads to an effective theory of the junction that is characteristic for FQH effect of bosons, with a minimal integer excitation charge equal to two, and with elementary quasiparticle charge equal to 2/3. These values can be measured by studying shot noise in tunneling experiments. Under the assumption of ballistic transport in the arms connecting the junction to contacts, the two-terminal conductance of the junction is found to be 4/3 for the former localization channel and 1/3 for the latter. The four-terminal conductance matrix reveals in this regime a strong quantized drag between the edges induced by neutral-mode localization. The two localization channels lead to opposite signs of the drag conductance, equal to $\pm 1/4$, which can also be interpreted as a special type of Andreev scattering. Coherent random tunneling in arms of the device (which are segments of 2/3 edges) leads to strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductance matrix. In the case of fully equilibrated arms, transport via the junction is insensitive to neutral-mode localization: The two-terminal conductance is quantized to 2/3 and the drag is absent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the semiconductor quantum dot placed in a solid-state material allows for deterministic emission of single photons, the photon indistinguishability is strongly influenced by the intrinsic coupling to lattice vibrations, phonons, of the solid-state environment. This work investigates the phonon-induced decoherence for a quantum dot placed in the one-dimensional system of a homogeneous cylindrical nanowire. Such a structure supports multiple longitudinal phonon branches, and we consider both a linear and a quadratic coupling of the emitter to these modes. Under a polaron approach, we initially derive an analytical expression for the 1D pure dephasing rate, which leads to a reduced pure dephasing rate compared with bulk. By implementing these results into a full cavity quantum electrodynamic model, we demonstrate that multimode coupling is necessary to correctly predict the indistinguishability in a 1D system, which may otherwise be significantly underestimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions in the presence of a space-dependent chiral gauge field and thermodynamic gradients, establishing a connection to the inverse spin Hall effect. The chiral gauge field induces a chiral magnetic field, resulting in a surface Fermi arc state and a chiral Landau level state which, although is delocalized in the bulk, we show to be more robust against impurities. By applying chemical potential and temperature gradients, we achieve nonzero charge currents, with each gradient leading to distinct Fermi level dependencies, both of which have been observed in a recent experiment. Unlike the conventional mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, our currents require a noncollinear chiral magnetic field and thermodynamic gradient. We further derive low-energy transport formulas and demonstrate the importance of carefully treating the ultraviolet cutoff for understanding our lattice calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>

Abstract: As for the study of Landau level wavefunctions for the quantum Hall effect, the magnetic Bloch wavefunctions based on the magnetic translation symmetry have been extensively investigated in the past few decades. In this article, the electric Floquet-Bloch wavefunctions based on the electric translation symmetry are studied as well as the momentum-frequency Brillouin zone, which is applied to the problem of one dimensional tight-binding model under an external electric field. The spectrum of electric Floquet-Bloch states can be generated by the projective representation of electric translation group, and the topological properties of these states are investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge of the occupation ratio and the energy splitting of a two-level system yields a direct readout of its temperature. Based on this principle, the determination of the temperature of an individual two-level magnetic atom was demonstrated using Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (ESR-STM). The temperature determination proceeds in two steps. First, energy splitting is determined using ESR-STM. Second, the equilibrium occupation of the two-level atom is determined in a resonance experiment of a second nearby atom, that has now two different resonant peaks, associated to the two states of the magnetic two-level atom. The ratio of the heights of its resonance peaks yields the occupation ratio. Here we present theory work to address three key aspects: first, we find how shot-noise and back-action limit the precision of this thermometry method; second, we study how the geometry of the nearby spins can be used to enhance signal-to-noise ratio. We predict ESR-STM thermometry can achieve a resolution of 10 mK using temperatures in the T= 1K range. Third, we show how ESR-STM thermometry can be used to detect thermal gradients as small as 5 mK/nm.</description>

Abstract: We study interaction-induced backscattering mechanism for helical edge states of a two dimensional topological insulator which is tunnel-coupled to a puddle located near the edge channel. The mechanism does not involve inelastic scattering and is due to the zero-mode fluctuations in a puddle. We discuss in detail a simple model of a puddle - a cavity in the bulk of the topological insulator. Such a cavity also has helical edge states which are tunnel-coupled with helical states encompassing the topological insulator. We analyze effect of the edge current in the puddle. Although averaged value of this current is equal to zero, its zero-mode fluctuations act, in the presence of electron-electron interaction, similar to magnetic flux thus allowing backscattering processes, which involve tunneling through the puddle. Rectification of these fluctuations leads to a finite probability of backscattering. This effect is further enhanced due to dephasing process which is also dominated by zero-mode fluctuations. Remarkably, for temperature exceeding level spacing in the puddle, the rate of backscattering does not depend on temperature in a good agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological Insulator in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterotrilayers</title>

Abstract: The quantum spin Hall effect has been predicted in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) owing to the layer-pseudospin magnetic field. Recently, experimental observations have also confirmed such topological states of matter. However, the topological electronic properties in multilayer moir\'e superlattices remain to be further explored. In twisted TMDs heterotrilayers, the realization of moir\'e potential with various symmetries becomes feasible. Here, we demonstrate that twisted trilayer TMDs can enter a topological insulator phase under the influence of moir\'e potential with ${C_6}$ symmetry. Specifically, we built two types of trilayer heterostructures, where the low-energy valence band electrons are contributed by the middle layer. In the AA-stacked moir\'e WS$_2$/WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$ heterotrilayers where only the middle layer is twisted, the maxima of the moir\'e potential exhibits an approximate ${C_6}$ symmetry. The $C_6$ symmetry effectively compensates for the spatial inversion symmetry breaking in the WSe$_2$ layer, leading to a twist-angle-dependent topological phase transition. Leveraging a Green's function approach, we calculate the local state density of edge states at topological minigaps, confirming their nature as moir\'e edge states. In the helical twisted AA-stacked moir\'e MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$ heterotrilayers, we observed a mosaic pattern of topological and trivial insulators. The emergence of topological mosaic is attributed to the maxima of the local moir\'e potential possessing $C_6$ symmetry. The results provide a new way for the experimental realization of topological phases in TMDs heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement assisted via Duffing nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to enhance quantum entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting the so-called Duffing nonlinearity. Our model system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, both driven by an optical field. One resonator supports Duffing nonlinearity, while the other does not.The resonators are coupled to each other via the so-called phonon hopping mechanism. The hopping rate is $\theta$-phase-dependent that induces Exceptional Points (EPs) singularities in the system. Interestingly, while the resonator with Duffing nonlinearity exhibits vanishing entanglement with light, we observe an increase in entanglement between light and the other mechanical resonator. This enhanced entanglement persists longer against thermal fluctuations compared to the one without the nonlinearity. Additionally, this entanglement features a sudden death and revival phenomenon, where the peaks happen at the multiple of $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$. This work opens a new avenue for exploiting nonlinear resources to generate strong quantum entanglement, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum computing within complex systems.</description>

      <title>Minimal Models for Altermagnetism</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets feature vanishing net magnetization, like antiferromagnets, but exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking and momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Motivated by the prevalence of altermagnetic materials with non-symmorphic symmetry-dictated band degeneracies, we provide realistic minimal models for altermagnetism by constructing tight-binding models for nonsymmorphic space groups with a sublattice defined by two magnetic atoms. These models can be applied to monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic materials and can describe d-wave, g-wave, and i-wave altermagnetism. By examining the altermagnetic susceptibility and mean field instabilities within a Hubbard model we reveal that these models have altermagnetic ground states and yield a Berry curvature that is linear in the spin-orbit coupling. We apply our models to RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, FeSb$_2$, $\kappa$-Cl, CrSb, and MnTe.</description>

      <title>Ubiquity of the spin-orbit induced magnon nonreciprocity in ultrathin ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The propagation of magnons along a symmetry path may depend on the direction of propagation, similar to many other quasiparticles in nature. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as nonreciprocity. In addition to the fact that it is of great interest to understand the fundamental physical mechanism leading to this nonreciprocal propagation, the phenomenon of magnon nonreciprocity may be used to design magnon-based logic devices. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a significantly large spin-orbit coupling can lead to giant nonreciprocity of exchange-dominated terahertz magnons, when they are excited by means of spin-polarized electrons [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{132},~126702~(2024)]. Here, by providing experimental results on two additional systems we demonstrate the generality of the observed phenomenon. Comparing the results of a Co/Ni bilayer on Ir(001) to those of a Co double layer on Ir(001) and W(110) we unravel the impact of the interfacial electronic hybridization on the observed phenomenon and provide further insights into the microscopic mechanism leading to this nonreciprocal magnon excitation. It was observed that the interfacial electronic hybridization is of some importance but is not crucial for the magnon nonreciprocity. This is an important observation since the electronic hybridization is known to be a key aspect in the determination of the magnetic properties at the interface. On the other hand the choice of the incident energy of the incoming electron beam is decisive for the observation of the effect. Our results indicate that depending on the energy of the incident electron beam and the scattering geometry the magnon nonreciprocity can be tuned and even be inverted for some ranges of the magnon momentum.</description>

      <title>Composite helical edges from Abelian fractional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an interacting composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge state made of a regular helical liquid carrying charge $e$ and a (fractionalized) helical liquid carrying charge $e/n$. A systematic framework is developed for these composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge states with $n=1,2,3$. For $n=2$, the composite edge state consists of a regular helical Luttinger liquid and a fractional topological insulator (the Abelian $Z_4$ topological order) edge state arising from half-filled conjugated Chern bands. The composite edge state with $n=2$ is pertinent to the recent twisted MoTe$_2$ experiment, suggesting a possible fractional topological insulator with conductance $\frac{3}{2}\frac{e^2}{h}$ per edge. Using bosonization, we construct generic phase diagrams in the presence of $weak$ Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In addition to a phase of free bosons, we find a time-reversal symmetry-breaking localized insulator, two perfect positive drag phases, a perfect negative drag phase (for $n=2,3$), a time-reversal symmetric Anderson localization (only for $n=1$), and a disorder-dominated metallic phase analogous to the $\nu=2/3$ disordered fractional quantum Hall edges (only for $n=3$). We further compute the two-terminal edge-state conductance, the primary experimental characterization for the (fractional) topological insulator. Remarkably, the negative drag phase gives rise to an unusual edge-state conductance, $(1-1/n)\frac{e^2}{h}$, not directly associated with the filling factor. We further investigate the effect of an applied in-plane magnetic field. For $n&gt;1$, the applied magnetic field can result in a phase with edge-state conductance $\frac{1}{n}\frac{e^2}{h}$, providing another testable signature. Our work establishes a systematic understanding of the composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge, paving the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Magnon squeezing via reservoir-engineered optomagnomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to prepare magnonic squeezed states in an optomagnomechanical system, in which magnetostriction induced mechanical displacement couples to an optical cavity via radiation pressure. We discuss two scenarios depending on whether the magnomechanical coupling is linear or dispersive. We show that in both cases the strong mechanical squeezing obtained via two-tone driving of the optical cavity can be efficiently transferred to the magnon mode. In the linear coupling case, stationary magnon squeezing is achieved; while in the dispersive coupling case, a transient magnonic squeezed state is prepared in a two-step protocol. The proposed magnonic squeezed states find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing using magnons.</description>

      <title>Giant strain-induced spin splitting effect in MnTe, a $g$-wave altermagnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal MnTe is an altermagnetic semiconductor with $g$-wave symmetry of spin polarization in momentum space. In the nonrelativistic limit, this symmetry mandates that electric current flowing in any crystallographic direction is unpolarized. However, it is shown that elastic strain is effective in inducing the spin splitting effect in MnTe. For this analysis, a spin-orbit-coupled $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian for the valence band maximum at the A point is derived and fitted to eigenvalues calculated from first principles. The spin splitting angle is calculated using the Boltzmann approach in the relaxation-time approximation. The spin splitting gauge factor exceeds 20 near the valence band maximum. Thus, with suitable substrate engineering, MnTe can be used as an efficient source and detector of spin current in spintronic devices. Proper inclusion of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is crucial for the correct description of the transport properties of MnTe.</description>

      <title>Proposal for bulk measurement of braid statistics in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasiparticles (QPs) or quasiholes (QHs) of fractional quantum Hall states have been predicted to obey fractional braid statistics, which refers to the Berry phase (in addition to the usual Aharonov-Bohm phase) associated with an exchange of two QPs or two QHs, or equivalently, to half of the phase associated with a QP/QH going around another. Certain phase slips in interference experiments in the fractional quantum Hall regime have been attributed to fractional braid statistics, where the interference probes the Berry phase associated with a closed path which has segments along the edges of the sample as well as through the bulk (where tunneling occurs). Noting that QPs / QHs with sharply quantized fractional charge and fractional statistics do not exist at the edge of a fractional quantum Hall state due to the absence of a gap there, we provide arguments that the existence of composite fermions at the edge is sufficient for understanding the primary experimental observations; composite fermions are known to occur in compressible states without a gap. We further propose that transport through a closed $\textit{tunneling}$ loop contained entirely in the bulk can, in principle, allow measurement of the braid statistics in a way that the braiding object explicitly has a fractionally quantized charge over the entire loop. Optimal parameters for this experimental geometry are determined from quantitative calculations.</description>

      <title>Efficient excitation transfer in an LH2-inspired nanoscale stacked ring geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength ring-shaped structures of quantum emitters exhibit outstanding radiation properties and are useful for antennas, excitation transport, and storage. Taking inspiration from the oligomeric geometry of biological light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes, we study here generic examples and predict highly efficient excitation transfer in a three-dimensional (3D) subwavelength concentric stacked ring structure with a diameter of 400 $nm$, formed by two-level atoms. Utilizing the quantum optical open system master equation approach for the collective dipole dynamics, we demonstrate that, depending on the system parameters, our bio-mimicked 3D ring enables efficient excitation transfer between two ring layers. Our findings open prospects for engineering other biomimetic light-matter platforms and emitter arrays to achieve efficient energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Observation of converse flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>
