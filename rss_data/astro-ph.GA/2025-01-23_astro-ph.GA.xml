      <title>Ripples spreading across the Galactic disc: Interplay of direct and indirect effects of the Sagittarius dwarf impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia data have revealed vertically asymmetric phase-space structures in the Milky Way (MW) disc, such as phase spirals, indicating vertical oscillations. These oscillations exhibit two distinct modes: the bending mode and the breathing mode, associated with one-arm and two-arm phase spirals, respectively. This study aims to explore the excitation mechanisms of the bending and breathing modes and their subsequent evolution in the MW disc, focusing on the interplay between direct perturbations from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and indirect contributions from tidally induced spiral arms. We perform high-resolution $N$-body simulations to model the interaction between an MW-like disc galaxy and a Sagittarius dwarf-like satellite. These simulations resolve fine phase-space structures, enabling analysis of the bending and breathing modes at both macroscopic (global bending and breathing waves) and microscopic (local phase spirals) scales. Our simulations demonstrate that the satellite's perturbation directly excites the bending mode and induces spiral arms in the galactic disc. These spiral arms excite the breathing mode, making it an indirect consequence of the satellite interaction. Initially, the bending mode dominates, but it rapidly decays due to horizontal mixing. In contrast, the breathing mode persists for a longer duration, sustained by the spiral arms, leading to a transition from a bending-dominated to a breathing-dominated state. This transition progresses faster in the inner galaxy than in the outer regions. The simulations reproduce the one-arm phase spiral observed in the solar neighbourhood and reveal two-arm phase spirals, particularly in the inner galaxy, associated with spiral arm-induced breathing modes. Our findings highlight the combined effects of direct satellite perturbations and indirect spiral arm dynamics in shaping the vertical structure of the MW disc.</description>

      <title>The AGN Optical Variability Fundamental Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between AGN optical variability timescales, amplitudes, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses using homogeneous light curves from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). We fit a damped random walk (DRW) model to high-cadence, long-baseline ASAS-SN light curves to estimate the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_\text{DRW}$) and amplitude ($\sigma$) for 57 AGN with precise SMBH mass measurements from reverberation mapping and dynamical methods. We confirm a significant correlation between $\tau_\text{DRW}$ and SMBH mass, and find: $\text{log}_{10}(M_\text{BH}/ \text{M}_\odot) = (1.85\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10} (\tau_\text{DRW}/200 \text{ days})+7.59\pm0.08$. Incorporating $\hat{\sigma}^2 = 2\sigma^2/\tau_\text{DRW}$ in a plane model significantly improves residuals, and we find: $\text{log}_{10}(M_\text{BH}/ \text{M}_\odot) = (2.27\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10} (\tau_\text{DRW}/200\text{ days})+(1.20\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10}(\hat{\sigma}/\text{1 mJy/days}^{1/2})+7.68\pm0.08$ with a scatter of 0.39 dex. We calculate $\tau_\text{DRW}$, $\hat{\sigma}$, and estimate SMBH masses for 203 bright ($V&lt;16$ mag) AGN from the Milliquas catalog and compare these estimates with measurements from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey for 42 overlapping AGN. In 10 years, LSST could extend this method to survey $7\lesssim\text{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\lesssim9$ SMBHs out to $z\sim1$ and $\textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\sim8.0$ out to $z\sim4$, and ASAS-SN could probe $5\lesssim \textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\lesssim10.5$ SMBHs in the local universe and $\textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\sim9.0$ out to $z\sim2$. Measuring AGN variability with these datasets will provide a unique probe of SMBH evolution by making estimates of $M_\text{BH}$ spanning several orders of magnitude with photometric observations alone.</description>

      <title>Intervening nuclear obscuration changing the X-ray look of the $z\approx6$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations of the optically selected $z=6.025$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor $\gtrsim7$ from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among $z&gt;6$ QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at $z&gt;6$. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor $&gt;20$. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at $z&gt;6$ will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Exploring quasar evolution with proximate molecular absorbers: Insights from the kinematics of highly ionized nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the presence and kinematics of NV absorption proximate to high redshift quasars selected upon the presence of strong $H_{2}$ and HI absorption at the quasar redshift. Our spectroscopic observations with X-shooter at the VLT reveal a 70% detection rate of NV (9 of 13 quasars with 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.3), remarkably higher than the 10% detection rate in intervening DLA systems and the 30% rate observed within a few thousand km/s of the source in the general quasar population. While many NV components lie within the velocity range of the neutral gas, the kinematic profiles of high-ionization species appear decoupled from those of low-ionization species, with the former extending over much larger velocity ranges, particularly towards bluer velocities. We also observe significant variations in the NV/SiIV, which we attribute to varying ionization conditions, with a velocity-dependent trend: blueshifted NV components systematically exhibit higher ionization parameters compared to those near the quasar's systemic redshift. Furthermore, the most redshifted systems relative to the quasar show no evidence of NV absorption. The results suggest that proximate $H_{2}$ absorption systems select critical stages of quasar evolution, during which the quasar remains embedded in a rich molecular environment. Redshifted systems trace infalling gas, potentially associated with mergers, preceding the onset of outflows. Such outflows may reach or even carry out neutral and molecular gas.This latter stage would correspond to proximate $H_{2}$ systems located around or blueshifted relative to the quasar's systemic z. Finally, the only case in our sample featuring highly blueshifted neutral gas shows no evidence of an association with the quasar.Our findings highlight the need to account for the ionization state when defining a velocity threshold to distinguish quasar-associated systems from intervening.</description>

      <title>Formation of massive star clusters with and without iron abundance spreads in a dwarf galaxy merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the formation of star clusters and their properties in a dwarf-dwarf merging galaxy, we have performed a numerical simulation of a dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger by using the Tree+GRAPE $N$-body/SPH code ASURA. In our simulation, 13 young star clusters are formed during the merger process. We show that our simulated star clusters can be divided into two types: with and without [Fe/H] abundance variations. The former is created by a seed star cluster (the first-generation stars) formed in compressed gas. These stars contaminate the surrounding gas by Type II supernovae (SNe). At that time, the energy injection is insufficient to induce an outflow of the surrounding gas. After that, the contaminated gas falls into the seed, thereby forming a new generation of stars from the contaminated gas. We also show that most star clusters are formed in the galactic central region after the second encounter and fall into the galactic center due to dynamical friction within several hundred Myr. As a result, close encounters and mergers between the clusters take place. Although the clusters with shallower gravitational potential are tidally disrupted by these close encounters, others survive and finally merge at the center of the merged dwarf galaxies to create a nuclear star cluster. Therefore, the nuclear star cluster is comprised of various stellar components in [Fe/H] abundance and age. We discuss our work in the context of observations and demonstrate the diagnostic power of high-resolution simulations in the context of star cluster formation.</description>

      <title>A Pilot Study for the CSST Slitless Spectroscopic Quasar Survey Based on Mock Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide survey of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will observe a large field of 17,500 $\text{deg}^2$. The GU, GV, and GI grism observations of CSST will cover a wavelength range from 2550 to 10000\r{A} at a resolution of $R\sim 200$ and a depth of about 22 AB magnitude for the continuum. In this paper, we present a pipeline to identify quasars and measure their physical properties with the CSST mock data. We simulate the raw images and extract the one-dimensional grism spectra for quasars, galaxies, and stars with the r-band magnitudes of $18&lt;\text{m}_{\text{r}}&lt;22$ using the CSST Cycle 6 simulation code. Using a convolution neural network, we separate quasars from stars and galaxies. We measure the redshifts by identifying the strong emission lines of quasars. We also fit the 1D slitless spectra with QSOFITMORE to estimate the black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy can effectively separate quasars with redshifts $z=0-5$ from other types of objects with an accuracy of 99\%. Among those successfully classified quasars, 90\% of them could have precise redshift measurements with $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}=0.002$. The scatters of black hole masses and Eddington ratios from the spectral fittings are 0.13 and 0.15 dex, respectively. The metallicity diagnosis line ratios have a scatter of 0.1-0.2 dex. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy survey has the potential to discover about 0.9 million new quasars and provide important contributions to AGN science and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Radio and Optical Properties of the blazar PKS 1614+051 at z=3.21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the radio and optical properties of the high-frequency peaker (HFP) blazar PKS 1614+051 at $z=3.21$ based on the data covering the time period of 1997-2024. The radio data are represented by the almost instantaneous 1-22 GHz measurements from the SAO RAS RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the IAA RAS RT-32 telescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope of CrAO RAS. The optical measurements in the $R$ band were collected with the SAO RAS 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m AS-500/2 telescopes and the ZTF archive data. We have found low overall variability indices (0.1-0.2) and a spectral peak around 4.6 GHz, which is stable during the long-term period of monitoring. An analysis of the radio light curves reveals significant time delays (0.6 to 6.4 years) between the radio frequencies along with variability timescales ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 years in the source's rest frame, which is similar to the blazars at lower redshifts. Spectral modeling suggests the presence of both synchrotron-self absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA) processes. Based on the SSA model, we provide estimates of the magnetic field strength, which peaks at $\sim\!30$ mG. A spectroscopic study with the BTA SCORPIO-I spectrograph has found signs of the regular motion of a neutral hydrogen envelope around the blazar center, which confirms the presence of enough gaseous matter to form an external FFA screen. The results highlight the importance of multiwavelength and long-term monitoring to understand the physical mechanisms driving the variability in high-redshift blazars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields limit the mass of Population III stars even before the onset of protostellar radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.</description>

      <title>Large discrepancies in error estimates for reverberation times derived from light curves of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-travel-time delays provide one of the most powerful ways of learning about the structure and kinematics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Estimating delays from observations of AGN variability presents statistical challenges because the time series are almost invariably irregularly sampled. Correct assessment of errors in lag estimates is important for evaluating results. The most widely used method of determining phase lags has been the interpolated cross-correlation function method introduced by Gaskell and Sparke (1986, GS). It is shown here that the widely used modified smooth bootstrap method of Peterson et al. (1998) significantly overestimates the error in lags derived using the GS, especially for poorly sampled light curves. The remarkably high accuracy claimed for lags obtained by the JAVELIN method of Zu et al. (2011) (more than an order of magnitude improvement for 25% of cases) is spurious and the accuracy no better than the GS method. A related method proposed by Li et al. (2013) suffers from similar but less serious problems. A slightly modified version of the analytic formula of Gaskell and Peterson (1987) gives an easy and accurate way of estimating lag errors for well-sampled, high-quality data. The width of the continuum autocorrelation function is shown to be proportional to the square root of the luminosity. This is useful in planning observing campaigns. The discrete correlation function method is less powerful than the GS method and for many typical situations gives errors in the lag twice as large as those of the GS method.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Bar-induced Non-Circular Motions on the Measurement of Galactic Rotation Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of bar-induced non-circular motions on the derivation of galactic rotation curves (RCs) using hydrodynamic simulations and observational data from the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We confirm that non-circular motions induced by a bar can significantly bias RCs derived from the conventional tilted-ring method, consistent with previous findings. The shape of the derived RC depends on the position angle difference ($\Delta \phi$) between the major axes of the bar and the disk in the face-on plane. For $\left|\Delta \phi\right|\lesssim40^\circ$, non-circular motions produce a bar-induced "dip" feature (rise-drop-rise pattern) in the derived RC, which shows higher velocities near the nuclear ring and lower velocities in the bar region compared to the true RC (${\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$). We demonstrate convincingly that such dip features are very common in the PHANGS-ALMA barred galaxies sample. Hydrodynamical simulations reveal that the "dip" feature is caused by the perpendicular orientation of the gas flows in the nuclear ring and the bar; at low $\left|\Delta \phi\right|$ streamlines in the nuclear ring tend to enhance $V_\mathrm{los}$, while those in the bar tend to suppress $V_\mathrm{los}$. We use a simple {\misaell} model to qualitatively explain the general trend of RCs from the tilted-ring method (${\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$) and the discrepancy between ${\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$ and ${\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward method to implement a first-order correction to the RC derived from the tilted-ring method. Our study is the first to systematically discuss the bar-induced "dip" feature in the RCs of barred galaxies combining both simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Can supermassive stars form in protogalaxies due to internal Lyman-Werner feedback?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population III stars are possible precursors to early massive and supermassive black holes (BHs). The presence of soft UV Lyman Werner (LW) background radiation can suppress Population III star formation in minihalos and allow them to form in pristine atomic cooling halos. In the absence of molecular hydrogen ($\rm H_2$) cooling, atomic-cooling halos enable rapid collapse with suppressed fragmentation. High background LW fluxes from preceding star-formation have been proposed to dissociate $\rm H_2$. This flux can be supplemented by LW radiation from one or more Population III star(s) in the same halo, reducing the necessary background level. Here we consider atomic-cooling halos in which multiple protostellar cores form close to one another nearly simultaneously. We assess whether the first star's LW radiation can dissociate nearby $\rm H_2$, enabling the prompt formation of a second, supermassive star (SMS) from warm, atomically-cooled gas. We use a set of hydrodynamical simulations with the code ENZO, with identical LW backgrounds centered on a halo with two adjacent collapsing gas clumps. When an additional large local LW flux is introduced, we observe immediate reductions in both the accretion rates and the stellar masses that form within these clumps. While the LW flux reduces the $\text{H}_2$ fraction and increases the gas temperature, the halo core's potential well is too shallow to promptly heat the gas to $\gtrsim$ 1000 K and increase the accretion rate onto the second protostar. We conclude that internal LW feedback inside atomic-cooling halos is unlikely to facilitate the formation of SMSs or massive BH seeds.</description>

      <title>Constraining the shape of dark matter haloes using only starlight. I. A new technique and its application to the galaxy Nube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new technique to constrain the gravitational potential of a galaxy from the observed stellar mass surface density alone under a number of assumptions. It uses the classical Eddington Inversion Method to compute the phase-space distribution function (DF) needed for the stars to reside in a given gravitational potential. In essence, each potential defines a set of density profiles, and it is the expansion of the observed profile in this database that provides the DF. If the required DF becomes negative then the potential is inconsistent with the observed stars and can be discarded. It is particularly well-suited for analyzing low-mass low surface brightness galaxies, where photometric but not spectroscopic data can be obtained. The recently discovered low surface brightness galaxy 'Nube' was used to showcase its application. For the observed Nube's stellar core to be reproduced with non-negative DF, cuspy NFW (Navarro, Frenk, and White) potentials are highly disfavored compared with potentials having cores (Schuster-Plummer or rho-230). The method assumes the stellar system to have spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution, however, we discuss simple extensions that relax the need for isotropy and may help to drop the spherical symmetry assumption.</description>

      <title>On the Use of WGANs for Super Resolution in Dark-Matter Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution techniques have the potential to reduce the computational cost of cosmological and astrophysical simulations. This can be achieved by enabling traditional simulation methods to run at lower resolution and then efficiently computing high-resolution data corresponding to the simulated low-resolution data. In this work, we investigate the application of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to increase the particle resolution of dark-matter-only simulations, reproducing and building on prior results. Our WGAN models successfully generate high-resolution data with summary statistics, including the power spectrum and halo mass function, that closely match those of true high-resolution simulations. We also identify a limitation of the WGAN model in the form of smeared features in the generated high-resolution snapshots, particularly in the shapes of dark-matter halos.</description>

      <title>The outer structure of old star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results on the internal dynamical evolution of old star clusters located in the outer regions of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Because the SMC has been imprinted with evidence of tidal interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we investigated at what extend such an interaction has produced extra tidal structures or excess of stars beyond the clusters' tidal radii. For that purpose, we used the Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) DR2 data sets to build number density radial profiles of suitable star clusters, and derived their structural and internal dynamics parameters. The analysed stellar density profiles do not show any evidence of tidal effects caused by the LMC. On the contrary, the Jacobi volume of the selected SMC star clusters would seem underfilled, with a clear trend toward a smaller percentage of underfilled volume as their deprojected distance to the SMC centre increases. Moreover, the internal dynamical evolution of SMC star clusters would seem to be influenced by the SMC gravitational field, being star clusters located closer to the SMC centre in a more advanced evolutionary stage. We compared the internal dynamical evolution of SMC old star clusters with those of LMC and Milky Way globular clusters, and found that Milky Way globular clusters have dynamical evolutionary paths similar to LMC/SMC old star clusters located closer to their respective galaxy's centres. Finally, we speculate with the possibility that globular clusters belonging to Magellanic Clouds like-mass galaxies have lived a couple of times their median relaxation times.</description>

      <title>BlackTHUNDER -- A non-stellar Balmer break in a black hole-dominated little red dot at $z=7.04$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at $2\lesssim z \lesssim 11$, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\beta$ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M_{\rm dyn}&lt;4 \times 10^8~M_{\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H$\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection ($3\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.</description>

      <title>Introducing the AIDA-TNG project: galaxy formation in alternative dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the AIDA-TNG project, a suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously model galaxy formation and different variations of the underlying dark matter model. We consider the standard cold dark matter model and five variations, including three warm dark matter scenarios and two self-interacting models with constant or velocity-dependent cross-section. In each model, we simulate two cosmological boxes of 51.7 and 110.7 Mpc on a side, with the same initial conditions as TNG50 and TNG100, and combine the variations in the physics of dark matter with the fiducial IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. The AIDA-TNG runs are thus ideal for studying the simultaneous effect of baryons and alternative dark matter models on observable properties of galaxies and large-scale structures. We resolve haloes in the range between $10^{8}$ and $4\times10^{14}\,$M$_{\odot}$ and scales down to the nominal resolution of 570 pc in the highest resolution runs. This work presents the first results on statistical quantities such as the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum; we quantify the modification in the number of haloes and the power on scales smaller than 1 Mpc, due to the combination of baryonic and dark matter physics. Despite being calibrated on cold dark matter, we find that the TNG galaxy formation model can produce a realistic galaxy population in all scenarios. The stellar and gas mass fraction, stellar mass function, black hole mass as a function of stellar mass and star formation rate density are very similar in all dark matter models, with some deviations only in the most extreme warm dark matter model. Finally, we also quantify changes in halo structure due to warm and self-interacting dark matter, which appear in the density profiles, concentration-mass relation and galaxy sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinematic parameters identified from high-velocity stars situated within 100 kpc are examined and analyzed. We included three high velocity programs comprising 591, 87, and 519 stars as a function of distances ranging from 0.10 to nearly 109 kpc. In this analysis, we will determine the spatial velocities (U, V, W) in galactic coordinates along with their velocity dispersion (sigma_1, sigma_2, sigma_3), the convergent point (Ao, Do), and therefore, the solar motion (S_sun).</description>

      <title>On Equation of State of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains mysterious despite the substantial evidence from astrophysical and cosmological observations. While the majority of DM in our universe is non-relativistic, collisionless and its equation of state (EoS) is approximately pressureless $p\simeq 0$, DM becomes relativistic near the massive black holes in galactic center. Yet its EoS is seldom discussed in the relativistic regime. Here we initially explore the possible equation of state for DM in the vicinity of Schwarzschild black holes. We work in a spherical and quasi-static background spacetime, and describe DM as a perfect fluid in equilibrium. Through numerically solving the TOV equations with physical boundary conditions, we show that DM can have static profiles near black holes and its pressure should be negative in order to support the viable density profiles $\rho$. We illustrate with two simple general equations of state, namely the power law $p \propto \rho^\gamma$ and the radius-dependent $p \propto r\cdot \rho$, and compare them with the observations of the Milky Way. Our findings provide insights into the model-building of DM, which should incorporate the possibility of negative pressure in the relativistic regime around black holes.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary tracks, ejecta, and ionizing photons from intermediate-mass to very massive stars with PARSEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.</description>

      <title>How complex are galaxies? A non-parametric estimation of the intrinsic dimensionality of wide-band photometric data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies are complex objects, yet the number of independent parameters to describe them remains unknown. We present here a non-parametric method to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of large datasets. We apply it to wide-band photometric data drawn from the COSMOS2020 catalogue and a comparable mock catalogue from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Our galaxy catalogues are limited in signal-to-noise ratio in all optical and NIR bands. Our results reveal that most of the variance in the wide-band photometry of this galaxy sample can be described with at most $4.3\pm0.5$ independent parameters for star-forming galaxies and $2.9\pm0.2$ for passive ones, both in the observed and simulated catalogues. We identify one of these parameters to be noise-driven, and recover that stellar mass and redshift are two key independent parameters driving the magnitudes. Our findings support the idea that wide-band photometry does not provide more than one additional independent parameter for star-forming galaxies. Although our sample is not mass-limited and may miss some passive galaxies due to our cut in SNR, our work suggests that dimensionality reduction techniques may be effectively used to explore and analyse wide-band photometric data, provided the used latent space is at least four-dimensional.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL Survey: Spatial extent of [CII] line emission in star-forming galaxies at $z=4-6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial extent and structure of the [CII] line emission in a sample of 34 galaxies at $z=4-6$ from the ALMA-CRISTAL Survey. By modeling the [CII] line emission in the interferometric visibility, we derive the effective radius of [CII] line emission assuming an exponential profile. The [CII] line radius ranges from 0.5 to 3.5 kpc with an average value of $\langle R_{e,[CII]}\rangle=1.90$ kpc. We compare the [CII] sizes with the sizes of rest-frame UV and FIR continua, which were measured from the HST F160W images and ALMA Band-7 continuum images, respectively. We confirm that the [CII] line emission is more spatially extended than the continuum emission, with average size ratios of $\langle R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,UV}\rangle=2.90$ and $\langle R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,FIR}\rangle=1.54$, although about half of the FIR-detected sample show comparable spatial extent between [CII] line and FIR continuum emission. The residual visibility of the best-fit model do not show statistical evidence of flux excess, indicating that the [CII] line emission in star-forming galaxies can be characterized by an extended exponential profile. Overall, our results suggest that the spatial extent of [CII] line emission can primarily be explained by PDRs associated with star formation activity, while the contribution from diffuse neutral medium (atomic gas) and the effects of past merger events may further expand the [CII] line distributions, causing their variations. Finally, we report the negative correlation between $\Sigma_{[CII]}$ and EW$_{Ly\alpha}$, and possible negative correlation between $R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,UV}$ and EW$_{Ly\alpha}$, which may be in line with the scenario that atomic gas largely contributes to the extended [CII] line emission. Future 3-D analysis of Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ lines will shed light on the association of the extended [CII] line emission with atomic gas and outflows.</description>

      <title>Internal Dynamics of Multiple Populations in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters: A Wide-Field study with Gaia and the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) across a wide field of view, extending from the innermost regions to the clusters' outskirts. Using astro-photometric catalogs from ground-based observations, Gaia, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify first- (1P) and second-population (2P) stars, and study the internal dynamics of MPs using high-precision Gaia DR3 and HST proper motions. Our results reveal that while the 1P transitions from isotropy to slight tangential anisotropy toward the outer regions, 2P stars become increasingly radially anisotropic beyond the half-light radius. We also explore the connection between the dynamics of MPs and the clusters' structural and dynamical properties, finding statistically significant differences in the anisotropy profiles of dynamically young and non-relaxed clusters, particularly beyond the 1-2 half-light radii. In these regions, 1P stars transition from isotropic to slightly tangentially anisotropic motion, while 2P stars become more radially anisotropic.
  In contrast, dynamically older clusters, with mixed MPs, exhibit weaker relative differences. Furthermore, clusters with orbits closer to the Galactic center exhibit larger dynamical differences between 1P and 2P stars than those with larger peri-Galactic radii. These findings are consistent with a scenario where 2P stars form in a more centrally concentrated environment, where the interaction with the Milky Way tidal field plays a crucial role in the dynamical evolution of MPs, especially of 1P.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the star formation histories of massive-quenched galaxies at $z=3$ in 3 semi-analytic models (SHARK, GAEA, GALFORM) and 3 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, Simba). We study the predicted number density and stellar mass function of massive-quenched galaxies, their formation and quenching timescales and star-formation properties of their progenitors. Predictions are disparate in all these diagnostics, for instance: (i) some simulations reproduce the observed number density of very massive-quenched galaxies ($&gt;10^{11}\rm M_{\odot}$) but underpredict the high density of intermediate-mass ones, while others fit well the lower masses but underpredict the higher ones; (ii) In most simulations, except for GAEA and EAGLE, most massive-quenched galaxies had starburst periods, with the most intense ones happening at $4&lt;z&lt;5$; however, only in SHARK and IllustrisTNG we do find a large number of progenitors with star formation rates $&gt;300\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$; (iii) quenching timescales are in the range $\approx 20-150$~Myr depending on the simulation; among other differences. These disparate predictions can be tied to the adopted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback model. For instance, the explicit black-hole (BH) mass dependence to trigger the "radio mode" in IllustrisTNG and Simba makes it difficult to produce quenched galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, also leading to higher baryon collapse efficiencies ($\approx 15-30$%); while the strong bolometric luminosity dependence of the AGN outflow rate in GAEA leads to BHs of modest mass quenching galaxies. Current observations are unable to distinguish between these different predictions due to the small sample sizes. However, these predictions are testable with current facilities and upcoming observations, allowing a "true physics experiment" to be carried out.</description>

      <title>The effects of super-Eddington accretion and feedback on the growth of early supermassive black holes and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift $z\approx4$ (when the halo mass is $\approx10^{13}$ M$_\odot$) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of $10^4$ M$_\odot$ at redshift $z\approx17$. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from $z=9$ to $z=5.5$, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around $z\approx7.5$, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By $z\approx4$ the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass$-$stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Early formation of supermassive black holes from the collapse of strongly self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence for high-redshift supermassive black holes challenges standard scenarios for how such objects form in the early universe. Here, we entertain the possibility that a fraction of the cosmological dark matter could be ultra-strongly self interacting. This would imply that gravothermal collapse occur at early times in the cores of dark matter halos, followed by accretion. We study under which conditions on the abundance and interaction strength and structure of such ultra self-interacting dark matter the black holes resulting from the end-point of gravothermal core collapse can seed the observed, early-forming supermassive black holes. We find, depending on the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross section, a bimodal structure in the favored parameter space, where data points to either a small collapsing dark matter fraction with a large cross section, or a large fraction and a relatively small cross section. While self-interaction cross sections with different velocity dependence can explain observations, we find that the best, self-consistent results correspond to a Rutherford-like self-interaction, typical of long-range dark-sector forces with light mediators. We discuss complementary observational probes if this scenario is realized in nature, focusing especially on the expected intermediate mass black holes predicted to exist in smaller galaxies.</description>

      <title>Weak-lensing Mass Reconstruction of Galaxy Clusters with a Convolutional Neural Network -- II: Application to Next-Generation Wide-Field Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional weak-lensing mass reconstruction techniques suffer from various artifacts, including noise amplification and the mass-sheet degeneracy. In Hong et al. (2021), we demonstrated that many of these pitfalls of traditional mass reconstruction can be mitigated using a deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we present our improvements and report on the detailed performance of our CNN algorithm applied to next-generation wide-field observations. Assuming the field of view ($3\deg.5 \times 3\deg.5$) and depth (27 mag at $5\sigma$) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we generated training datasets of mock shear catalogs with a source density of 33 arcmin$^{-2}$ from cosmological simulation ray-tracing data. We find that the current CNN method provides high-fidelity reconstructions consistent with the true convergence field, restoring both small and large-scale structures. In addition, the cluster detection utilizing our CNN reconstruction achieves $\sim75$% completeness down to $\sim 10^{14}M_{\odot}$. We anticipate that this CNN-based mass reconstruction will be a powerful tool in the Rubin era, enabling fast and robust wide-field mass reconstructions on a routine basis.</description>

      <title>From Dark Matter Minihalos to Large-Scale Radiative Feedback: A Self-Consistent 3D Simulation of the First Stars and Galaxies using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key obstacle to accurate models of the first stars and galaxies is the vast range of distance scales that must be considered. While star formation occurs on sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by large-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm bc}$) and Lyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of $\sim$100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize artificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and Population II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given by a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within each simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the surrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity, $\delta(\vec{x})$, and $v_{\rm bc}$ of the cell, then outputs the resulting star formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic model. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW background intensity on $\sim$100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including the detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of the low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full semi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield star formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of $\sim$7.3\% and $\sim$5.2\% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler sub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration, we find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to enhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII dominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: tracing the chemical enrichment pathways of high-redshift star-forming galaxies with O, Ar and Ne abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of eight star-forming galaxies with $\langle z \rangle = 4.0$ from the JWST EXCELS survey for which we obtain robust chemical abundance estimates for the $\alpha$-elements O, Ne and Ar. The $\alpha$-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in $\alpha$-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample significantly increases the number of sources with measurements of ${\rm Ar/O}$ at $z &gt; 2$, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with $\rm{Ar/O} = 0.65 \pm 0.10 \, (\rm{Ar/O})_{\odot}$. In contrast, the average Ne/O abundance is fully consistent with the solar ratio, with $\rm{Ne/O} = 1.07 \pm 0.12 \, (\rm{Ne/O})_{\odot}$. Our results support a scenario in which Ar has not had time to build up in the interstellar medium of young high-redshift galaxies, which are dominated by CCSNe enrichment. We show that these abundance estimates are in good agreement with recent Milky Way chemical evolution models, and with Ar/O trends observed for planetary nebulae in the Andromeda galaxy. These results highlight the potential for using multiple element abundance ratios to constrain the chemical enrichment pathways of early galaxies with JWST.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence and the invisible Universe: Subradiance as a dark matter mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Galactic population of free-floating planets from realistic initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first prediction for the mass distribution function of Galactic free-floating planets (FFPs) that aims to accurately include the relative contributions of multiple formation pathways and stellar populations. We derive our predicted distribution from dedicated simulations of planet birth, growth, migration, and ejection around circumbinary systems and extend these results to also include the contributions from single and wide binary systems. Our resulting FFP mass distribution shows several distinct features, including a strong peak at $\sim 8 M_{\oplus}$ arising from the transition between pebble and gas accretion regimes and a trough at $\sim 1 M_{\oplus}$ due to the shift in the dominant ejection process from planet-planet scattering to ejection through interactions with stars in circumbinary systems. We find that interactions with the central binary in close circumbinary systems are likely the dominant progenitor for FFPs more massive than Earth, leading to a steep power-law dependence in mass that agrees well with existing observations. In contrast, we find planet-planet scattering events in single and wide binary systems likely produce the majority of planets at Mars mass and below, resulting in a shallower power-law dependence. Our results suggest that existing extrapolations into the sub-terrestrial mass range may significantly overestimate the true FFP abundance. The features we predict in the mass distribution of FFPs will be detectable by upcoming space-based microlensing surveys and, if observed, will provide key insight into the origins of FFPs and the environments in which they form.</description>

      <title>Systematic collapse of the accretion disc in AGN confirmed by UV photometry and broad line spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent study on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN combined unobscured X-ray sources from the eROSITA eFEDS Survey with high quality optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). The HSC data enabled accurate host galaxy subtraction as well as giving a uniform black hole mass estimator from the stellar mass. The resulting stacked optical/X-ray SEDs for black holes at fixed mass show a dramatic transition, where the dominating disc component in bright AGN evaporates into an X-ray hot plasma below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. The models fit to these datasets predicted the largest change in SED in the rest frame UV ($&lt; 3000\,\r{A}$), but this waveband was not included in the original study. Here we use archival $u$-band and UV photometry to extend the SEDs into this range, and confirm the UV is indeed intrinsically faint in AGN below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ as predicted. This dramatic drop in UV photo-ionising flux is also seen from its effect on the broad emission lines. We stack the recently released SDSS DR18 optical spectra for this sample, and show that the broad H$\beta$ line disappears along with the UV bright component at $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. This shows that there is a population of unobscured, X-ray bright, UV faint AGN which lack broad emission lines (true type 2 Seyferts).</description>
