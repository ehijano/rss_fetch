      <title>MolFORM: Multi-modal Flow Matching for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) seeks to generate molecules that bind effectively to protein targets by leveraging their 3D structural information. While diffusion-based generative models have become the predominant approach for SBDD, alternative non-autoregressive frameworks remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce MolFORM, a novel generative framework that jointly models discrete (atom types) and continuous (3D coordinates) molecular modalities using multi-flow matching. To further enhance generation quality, we incorporate a preference-guided fine-tuning stage based on \textit{Direct Preference Optimization} (DPO), using Vina score as a reward signal. We propose a multi-modal flow DPO co-modeling strategy that simultaneously aligns discrete and continuous modalities, leading to consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</description>

      <title>A new engineering theory describing oblique free surface impact by flexible plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.08012v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consideration of slamming loads within the structural design of planning hulls is of critical importance in ensuring adequate structural performance in order to avoid potential catastrophic consequences. However, because of the intricacy in the interplay between complex fluid flows and nonlinear structural deformations that accompany the phenomenology of slamming, a general engineering theory in slamming has yet to be uncovered, and so design relies on specialized theories. In this paper, we propose one such theory for a design case that has, until now, eluded a proper description. In pursuit of this theory, we employ a specialized implicit, partitioned fluid-structural interaction (FSI) simulation approach, in order to study the underlying physical mechanisms accompanying the oblique impact of a flexible plate during water entry. In the present work, we first present validation results from flexible plate water entry experiments, to confirm the veracity of the developed FSI solver. Subsequent to validation, we carry out a series of numerical analyses, in an effort to characterize the regimes in impact force and plate out-of-plane deformations, as a function of impact velocities and plate flexural rigidity. Finally, we use our FSI solver, as a kind of "microscope", to study the mechanistic evolution of fluid flows and elastic plate deformations that occur during slamming. Based on these observations, we propose a novel, but simple engineering theory for flexible plates obliquely impacting the water free surface (e.g. high speed porpoising water craft reentry).</description>

      <title>Identifying heterogeneous micromechanical properties of biological tissues via physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10741v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneous micromechanical properties of biological tissues have profound implications across diverse medical and engineering domains. However, identifying full-field heterogeneous elastic properties of soft materials using traditional engineering approaches is fundamentally challenging due to difficulties in estimating local stress fields. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using data-driven models to learn full-field mechanical responses such as displacement and strain from experimental or synthetic data. However, research studies on inferring full-field elastic properties of materials, a more challenging problem, are scarce, particularly for large deformation, hyperelastic materials. Here, we propose a physics-informed machine learning approach to identify the elasticity map in nonlinear, large deformation hyperelastic materials. We evaluate the prediction accuracies and computational efficiency of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by inferring the heterogeneous elasticity maps across three materials with structural complexity that closely resemble real tissue patterns, such as brain tissue and tricuspid valve tissue. We further applied our improved architecture to three additional examples of breast cancer tissue and extended our analysis to three hyperelastic constitutive models: Neo-Hookean, Mooney Rivlin, and Gent. Our selected network architecture consistently produced highly accurate estimations of heterogeneous elasticity maps, even when there was up to 10% noise present in the training data.</description>

      <title>ADEPT: A Noninvasive Method for Determining Elastic Parameters of Valve Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19081v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer simulation of "virtual interventions" may inform optimal valve repair for a given patient prior to intervention. However, the paucity of noninvasive methods to determine in vivo mechanical parameters of valves limits the accuracy of computer prediction and their clinical application. To address this, we propose ADEPT: A noninvasive method for Determining Elastic Parameters of valve Tissue. In this work, we demonstrated its application to the tricuspid valve of a child. We first tracked valve displacements from open to closed frames within a 3D echocardiogram time sequence using image registration. Physics-informed neural networks were subsequently applied to estimate the nonlinear mechanical properties from first principles and reference displacements. The simulated model using these patient-specific parameters closely aligned with the reference image segmentation, achieving a mean symmetric distance of less than 1 mm. Our approach doubled the accuracy of the simulated model compared to the generic parameters reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Affective-ROPTester: Capability and Bias Analysis of LLMs in Predicting Retinopathy of Prematurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy. Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs. Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.</description>

      <title>Topic Modeling and Link-Prediction for Material Property Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also, missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials, suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Redefining Evaluation Standards: A Unified Framework for Evaluating the Korean Capabilities of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22968v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Korean large language models (LLMs) have driven numerous benchmarks and evaluation methods, yet inconsistent protocols cause up to 10 p.p performance gaps across institutions. Overcoming these reproducibility gaps does not mean enforcing a one-size-fits-all evaluation. Rather, effective benchmarking requires diverse experimental approaches and a framework robust enough to support them. To this end, we introduce HRET (Haerae Evaluation Toolkit), an open-source, registry-based framework that unifies Korean LLM assessment. HRET integrates major Korean benchmarks, multiple inference backends, and multi-method evaluation, with language consistency enforcement to ensure genuine Korean outputs. Its modular registry design also enables rapid incorporation of new datasets, methods, and backends, ensuring the toolkit adapts to evolving research needs. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, HRET incorporates Korean-focused output analyses-morphology-aware Type-Token Ratio (TTR) for evaluating lexical diversity and systematic keyword-omission detection for identifying missing concepts-to provide diagnostic insights into language-specific behaviors. These targeted analyses help researchers pinpoint morphological and semantic shortcomings in model outputs, guiding focused improvements in Korean LLM development.</description>
