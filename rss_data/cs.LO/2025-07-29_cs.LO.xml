      <title>Graded Quantitative Narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced framework of Graded Quantitative Rewriting is an innovative extension of traditional rewriting systems, in which rules are annotated with degrees drawn from a quantale. This framework provides a robust foundation for equational reasoning that incorporates metric aspects, such as the proximity between terms and the complexity of rewriting-based computations. Quantitative narrowing, introduced in this paper, generalizes quantitative rewriting by replacing matching with unification in reduction steps, enabling the reduction of terms even when they contain variables, through simultaneous instantiation and rewriting. In the standard (non-quantitative) setting, narrowing has been successfully applied in various domains, including functional logic programming, theorem proving, and equational unification. Here, we focus on quantitative narrowing to solve unification problems in quantitative equational theories over Lawverean quantales. We establish its soundness and discuss conditions under which completeness can be ensured. This approach allows us to solve quantitative equations in richer theories than those addressed by previous methods.</description>

      <title>Scroll nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new formalism for representing proofs in propositional logic called "scroll nets". Its fundamental construct is the "scroll", a topological notation for implication proposed by C. S. Peirce at the end of the 19th century as the basis for his diagrammatic system of existential graphs (EGs). Scroll nets are derived from EGs by following the Curry-Howard methodology of internalizing inference rules inside judgments, just as terms in type theory internalize natural deduction rules. We focus on the intuitionistic implicative fragment of EGs, starting from a natural diagrammatic representation of scroll nets, and then distilling their combinatorial essence into a purely graph-theoretic definition. We also identify a notion of detour, that we use to sketch a detour-elimination procedure akin to cut-elimination. We illustrate how to simulate normalization in the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus, demonstrating both the logical and computational expressivity of our framework.</description>

      <title>Synthesis Benchmarks for Automated Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Program synthesis is the task of constructing a program conforming to a given specification. We focus on deductive synthesis, and in particular on synthesis problems with specifications given as $\forall\exists$-formulas, expressing the existence of an output corresponding to any input. So far there has been no canonical benchmark set for deductive synthesis using the $\forall\exists$-format and supporting the so-called uncomputable symbol restriction. This work presents such a data set, composed by complementing existing benchmarks by new ones. Our data set is dynamically growing and should motivate future developments in the theory and practice of automating synthesis.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Theory of Probabilistic Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic concurrent systems are foundational models for modern mobile computing. In this paper, a general model-independent approach to probabilistic testing is proposed. With the help of a new distribution-based semantics for probabilistic models and a probabilistic testing framework with respect to process predicates, the model-independent characterization and the external characterization for testing equivalences are studied. The latter characterization can be viewed as the generalization of the classical fair/should equivalence and may equivalence. These equivalences are shown to be congruent. A thorough comparison between these equivalences and probabilistic bisimilarities is carried out. The techniques introduced in this paper can be easily extended to other probabilistic concurrent models.</description>

      <title>Active Monitoring with RTLola: A Specification-Guided Scheduling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stream-based monitoring is a well-established runtime verification approach which relates input streams, representing sensor readings from the monitored system, with output streams that capture filtered or aggregated results. In such approaches, the monitor is a passive external component that continuously receives sensor data from the system under observation. This setup assumes that the system dictates what data is sent and when, regardless of the monitor's current needs. However, in many applications -- particularly in resource-constrained environments like autonomous aircraft, where energy, size, or weight are limited -- this can lead to inefficient use of communication resources. We propose making the monitor an active component that decides, based on its current internal state, which sensors to query and how often. This behavior is driven by scheduling annotations in the specification, which guide the dynamic allocation of bandwidth towards the most relevant data, thereby improving monitoring efficiency. We demonstrate our approach using the stream-based specification language RTLola and assess the performance by monitoring a specification from the aerospace domain. With equal bandwidth usage, our approach detects specification violations significantly sooner than monitors sampling all inputs at a fixed frequency.</description>

      <title>Automated Catamorphism Synthesis for Solving Constrained Horn Clauses over Algebraic Data Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to satisfiability checking of Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) over Algebraic Data Types (ADTs). CHC-based automated verification has gained considerable attention in recent years, leading to the development of various CHC solvers. However, existing solvers for CHCs over ADTs are not fully satisfactory, due to their limited ability to find and express models involving inductively defined functions/predicates (e.g., those about the sum of list elements). To address this limitation, we consider catamorphisms (generalized fold functions), and present a framework for automatically discovering appropriate catamorphisms on demand and using them to express a model of given CHCs. We have implemented a new CHC solver called Catalia based on the proposed method. Our experimental results for the CHC-COMP 2024 benchmark show that Catalia outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in solving satisfiable CHCs over ADTs. Catalia was also used as a core part of the tool called ChocoCatalia, which won the ADT-LIA category of CHC-COMP 2025.</description>

Abstract: The study of categories abstracting the structural properties of relations has been extensively developed over the years, resulting in a rich and diverse body of work. This paper strives to provide a modern and comprehensive presentation of these ``categories for relations'', including their enriched version, further showing how they arise as Kleisli categories of suitable symmetric monoidal monads. The resulting taxonomy aims at bringing clarity and organisation to the numerous related concepts and frameworks occurring in the literature</description>

      <title>Properties for Paths in Graph Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formalism for defining properties of paths in graph databases, which can be used to restrict the number of solutions to navigational queries. In particular, our formalism allows us to define quantitative properties such as length or accumulated cost, which can be used as query filters. Furthermore, it enables the identification and removal of paths that may be considered ill-formed.
  The new formalism is defined in terms of an operational semantics for the query language that incorporates these new constructs, demonstrating its soundness and completeness by proving its compatibility with a simple logical semantics. We also analyze its expressive power, showing that path properties are more expressive than register automata. Finally, after discussing some complexity issues related to this new approach, we present an empirical analysis carried out using our prototype implementation of the graph database that serves as a running example throughout the paper. The results show that queries using path properties as filters outperform standard queries that do not use them.</description>

      <title>AxOSyn: An Open-source Framework for Synthesizing Novel Approximate Arithmetic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex, necessitating energy-efficient solutions for resource-constrained embedded systems. Approximate computing, which allows for controlled inaccuracies in computations, is emerging as a promising approach for improving power and energy efficiency. Among the key techniques in approximate computing are approximate arithmetic operators (AxOs), which enable application-specific optimizations beyond traditional computer arithmetic hardware reduction-based methods, such as quantization and precision scaling. Existing design space exploration (DSE) frameworks for approximate computing limit themselves to selection-based approaches or custom synthesis at fixed abstraction levels, which restricts the flexibility required for finding application-specific optimal solutions. Further, the tools available for the DSE of AxOs are quite limited in terms of exploring different approximation models and extending the analysis to different granularities. To this end, we propose AxOSyn, an open-source framework for the DSE of AxOs that supports both selection and synthesis approaches at various abstraction levels. AxOSyn allows researchers to integrate custom methods for evaluating approximations and facilitates DSE at both the operator-level and application-specific. Our framework provides an effective methodology for achieving energy-efficient, approximate operators.</description>

      <title>Finding Personalized Good-Enough Solutions to Unsatisfiable Stable Roommates Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching). Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute "good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>The Power of Negation in Higher-Order Datalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ under both the well-founded and the stable model semantics, establishing tight connections with complexity classes. We prove that under the well-founded semantics, for all $k\geq 1$, $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures k-EXP, a result that holds without explicit ordering of the input database. The proof of this fact can be performed either by using the powerful existential predicate variables of the language or by using partially applied relations and relation enumeration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this expressive power is retained within a stratified fragment of the language. Under the stable model semantics, we show that $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures co-(k-NEXP) using cautious reasoning and k-NEXP using brave reasoning, again with analogous results for the stratified fragment augmented with choice rules. Our results establish a hierarchy of expressive power, highlighting an interesting trade-off between order and non-determinism in the context of higher-order logic programming: increasing the order of programs under the well-founded semantics can surpass the expressive power of lower-order programs under the stable model semantics.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Cyclic First-Order Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic proof systems for Heyting and Peano arithmetic eschew induction axioms by accepting proofs which are finite graphs rather than trees. Proving that such a cyclic proof system coincides with its more conventional variants is often difficult: Previous proofs in the literature rely on intricate arithmetisations of the metamathematics of the cyclic proof systems.
  In this article, we present a simple and direct embedding of cyclic proofs for Heyting and Peano arithmetic into purely inductive, i.e. 'finitary', proofs by adapting a translation introduced by Sprenger and Dam for a cyclic proof system of $\mu\text{FOL}$ with explicit ordinal approximations. We extend their method to recover Das' result of $\text{C}\Pi_n \subseteq \text{I}\Pi_{n + 1}$ for Peano arithmetic. As part of the embedding we present a novel representation of cyclic proofs as a labelled sequent calculus.</description>

      <title>Dense Integer-Complete Synthesis for Bounded Parametric Timed Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the correctness of critical real-time systems, involving concurrent behaviours and timing requirements, is crucial. Timed automata extend finite-state automata with clocks, compared in guards and invariants with integer constants. Parametric timed automata (PTAs) extend timed automata with timing parameters. Parameter synthesis aims at computing dense sets of valuations for the timing parameters, guaranteeing a good behaviour. However, in most cases, the emptiness problem for reachability (i.e., the emptiness of the parameter valuations set for which some location is reachable) is undecidable for PTAs and, as a consequence, synthesis procedures do not terminate in general, even for bounded parameters. In this paper, we introduce a parametric extrapolation, that allows us to derive an underapproximation in the form of symbolic sets of valuations containing not only all the integer points ensuring reachability, but also all the (non-necessarily integer) convex combinations of these integer points, for general PTAs with a bounded parameter domain. We also propose two further algorithms synthesizing parameter valuations guaranteeing unavoidability, and preservation of the untimed behaviour w.r.t. a reference parameter valuation, respectively. Our algorithms terminate and can output sets of valuations arbitrarily close to the complete result. We demonstrate their applicability and efficiency using the tools Rom\'eo and IMITATOR on several benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open stochastic system \`a la Jan Willems is a system affected by two qualitatively different kinds of uncertainty: one is probabilistic fluctuation, and the other one is nondeterminism caused by a fundamental lack of information. We present a formalization of open stochastic systems in the language of category theory. Central to this is the notion of copartiality which models how the lack of information propagates through a system (corresponding to the coarseness of sigma-algebras in Willems' work). As a concrete example, we study extended Gaussian distributions, which combine Gaussian probability with nondeterminism and correspond precisely to Willems' notion of Gaussian linear systems. We describe them both as measure-theoretic and abstract categorical entities, which enables us to rigorously describe a variety of phenomena like noisy physical laws and uninformative priors in Bayesian statistics. The category of extended Gaussian maps can be seen as a mutual generalization of Gaussian probability and linear relations, which connects the literature on categorical probability with ideas from control theory like signal-flow diagrams.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-arity Tree Automata and QCTL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of automata (which we coin EU-automata) running on infininte trees of arbitrary (finite) arity. We develop and study several algorithms to perform classical operations (union, intersection, complement, projection, alternation removal) for those automata, and precisely characterise their complexities. We also develop algorithms for solving membership and emptiness for the languages of trees accepted by EU-automata.
  We then use EU-automata to obtain several algorithmic and expressiveness results for the temporal logic QCTL (which extends CTL with quantification over atomic propositions) and for MSO. On the one hand, we obtain decision procedures with optimal complexity for QCTL satisfiability and model checking; on the other hand, we obtain an algorithm for translating any QCTL formula with k quantifier alternations to formulas with at most one quantifier alternation, at the expense of a $(k + 1)$-exponential blow-up in the size of the formulas. Using the same techniques, we prove that any MSO formula can be translated into a formula with at most four quantifier alternations (and only one second-order-quantifier alternation), this time with a $(k + 2)$-exponential blow-up in the size of the formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08635v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study automatic synthesis of systems that interact with their environment and maintain privacy against an observer to the interaction. The system and the environment interact via sets $I$ and $O$ of input and output signals. The input to the synthesis problem contains, in addition to a specification, also a list of secrets, a function $cost: I\cup O\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, which maps each signal to the cost of hiding it, and a bound $b\in\mathbb{N}$ on the budget that the system may use for hiding of signals. The desired output is an $(I/O)$-transducer $T$ and a set $H\subseteq I\cup O$ of signals that respects the bound on the budget, thus $\sum_{s\in H} cost(s)\leq b$, such that for every possible interaction of $T$, the generated computation satisfies the specification, yet an observer, from whom the signals in $H$ are hidden, cannot evaluate the secrets.

We first show that the problem's complexity is 2EXPTIME-complete for specifications and secrets in LTL, making it no harder than synthesis without privacy requirements. We then analyze the complexity further, isolating the two aspects that do not exist in traditional synthesis: the need to hide secret values and the need to choose the set $H$. We do this by studying settings in which traditional synthesis is solvable in polynomial time -- when the specification formalism is deterministic automata and when the system is closed -- and show that each of these aspects adds an exponential blow-up in complexity. We continue and study bounded synthesis with privacy, where the input includes a bound on the synthesized transducer size, as well as a variant of the problem in which the observer has knowledge, either about the specification or about the system, which can be helpful in evaluating the secrets. Additionally, we study certified privacy, where the synthesis algorithm provides certification that the secrets remain hidden.</description>

      <title>Synthesis with Guided Environments</title>

Abstract: In the synthesis problem, we are given a specification, and we automatically generate a system that satisfies the specification in all environments. We introduce and study {\em synthesis with guided environments} (SGE, for short), where the system may harness the knowledge and computational power of the environment during the interaction. The underlying idea in SGE is that in many settings, in particular when the system serves or directs the environment, it is of the environment's interest that the specification is satisfied, and it would follow the guidance of the system. Thus, while the environment is still hostile, in the sense that the system should satisfy the specification no matter how the environment assigns values to the input signals, in SGE the system assigns values to some output signals and guides the environment via {\em programs\/} how to assign values to other output signals. A key issue is that these assignments may depend on input signals that are hidden from the system but are known to the environment, using programs like ``copy the value of the hidden input signal $x$ to the output signal $y$." SGE is thus particularly useful in settings where the system has partial visibility.
  We solve the problem of SGE, show its superiority with respect to traditional synthesis, and study theoretical aspects of SGE, like the complexity (memory and domain) of programs used by the system, as well as the connection of SGE to synthesis of (possibly distributed) systems with partial visibility.</description>

      <title>Domains, Information Frames, and Their Logic</title>

Abstract: In \cite{sp25}, continuous information frames were introduced that capture exactly all continuous domains. They are obtained from the information frames considered in \cite{sp21} by omitting the conservativity requirement. Information frames generalise Scott's information systems~\cite{sc82}: Instead of the global consistency predicate, there is now a local consistency predicate for each token. Strong information frames are obtained by strengthening the conditions for these predicates. Let $\CIF$ and $\SIF$ be the corresponding categories.
  In \cite{sxx08} another generalisation of Scott's information systems was introduced which also exactly captures all continuous domains. As shown in \cite{hzl15}, the definition can be simplified while maintaining the representation result. Let $\CIS$ and $\SCIS$ be the corresponding categories. It is shown that all these categories are equivalent. Moreover, the equivalence extends to the subcategories of (strong) continuous information frames with truth elements. Such information frames capture exactly all pointed continuous domains.
  Continuous information frames are families of rudimentary logics, associated with each token is a local consistency predicate and an entailment relation. However, they lack the expressive power of propositional logic. In an attempt to make each of this logics more expressible, continuous stratified conjunctive logics are introduced. These are families of conjunctive logics. The category $\CSL$ of such logics is shown to be isomorphic to $\SIF_{\bt}$, the category of strong continuous information frames with a truth element.</description>

Abstract: In \cite{Lyon24} the question of the decidability of quasi-dense modal logics is answered, and an upper bound in $\EXPSPACE$ is given. Unfortunately, authors' intricate proof seems to contain a major flaw that cannot be fixed, leaving the question wide open.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Model Integration with Open World Temporal Logic for Process Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities, confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms, implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes. This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.</description>
