      <title>A Model Checker for Natural Strategic Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last two decades, Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) has been proved to be very useful in modeling strategic reasoning for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, this logic struggles to capture the bounded rationality inherent in human decision-making processes. To overcome these limitations, Natural Alternating-time Temporal Logic (NatATL) has been recently introduced. As an extension of ATL, NatATL incorporates bounded memory constraints into agents' strategies, which allows to resemble human cognitive limitations. In this paper, we present a model checker tool for NatATL specifications - both for memoryless strategies and strategies with recall - integrated into VITAMIN, an open-source model checker designed specifically for MAS verification. By embedding NatATL into VITAMIN, we transform theoretical advancements into a practical verification framework, enabling comprehensive analysis and validation of strategic reasoning in complex multi-agent environments. Our novel tool paves the way for applications in areas such as explainable AI and human-in-the-loop systems, highlighting NatATL's substantial potential.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-driven Multi-Agent Simulation for News Diffusion Under Different Network Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news in the digital age has raised critical concerns, particularly regarding its impact on societal trust and democratic processes. Diverging from conventional agent-based simulation approaches, this work introduces an innovative approach by employing a large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent simulation to replicate complex interactions within information ecosystems. We investigate key factors that facilitate news propagation, such as agent personalities and network structures, while also evaluating strategies to combat misinformation. Through simulations across varying network structures, we demonstrate the potential of LLM-based agents in modeling the dynamics of misinformation spread, validating the influence of agent traits on the diffusion process. Our findings emphasize the advantages of LLM-based simulations over traditional techniques, as they uncover underlying causes of information spread -- such as agents promoting discussions -- beyond the predefined rules typically employed in existing agent-based models. Additionally, we evaluate three countermeasure strategies, discovering that brute-force blocking influential agents in the network or announcing news accuracy can effectively mitigate misinformation. However, their effectiveness is influenced by the network structure, highlighting the importance of considering network structure in the development of future misinformation countermeasures.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of Robot Platooning for Navigating Crowded Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies how groups of robots can effectively navigate through a crowd of agents. It quantifies the performance of platooning and less constrained, greedy strategies, and the extent to which these strategies disrupt the crowd agents. Three scenarios are considered: (i) passive crowds, (ii) counter-flow crowds, and (iii) perpendicular-flow crowds. Through simulations consisting of up to 200 robots, we show that for navigating passive and counter-flow crowds, the platooning strategy is less disruptive and more effective in dense crowds than the greedy strategy, whereas for navigating perpendicular-flow crowds, the greedy strategy outperforms the platooning strategy in either aspect. Moreover, we propose an adaptive strategy that can switch between platooning and greedy behavioral states, and demonstrate that it combines the strengths of both strategies in all the scenarios considered.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.08975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication is an effective mechanism for coordinating the behaviors of multiple agents, broadening their views of the environment, and to support their collaborations. In the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can improve the overall learning performance and achieve their objectives by communication. Agents can communicate various types of messages, either to all agents or to specific agent groups, or conditioned on specific constraints. With the growing body of research work in MADRL with communication (Comm-MADRL), there is a lack of a systematic and structural approach to distinguish and classify existing Comm-MADRL approaches. In this paper, we survey recent works in the Comm-MADRL field and consider various aspects of communication that can play a role in designing and developing multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. With these aspects in mind, we propose 9 dimensions along which Comm-MADRL approaches can be analyzed, developed, and compared. By projecting existing works into the multi-dimensional space, we discover interesting trends. We also propose some novel directions for designing future Comm-MADRL systems through exploring possible combinations of the dimensions.</description>

      <title>Learning a Stable, Safe, Distributed Feedback Controller for a Heterogeneous Platoon of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platooning of autonomous vehicles has the potential to increase safety and fuel efficiency on highways. The goal of platooning is to have each vehicle drive at a specified speed (set by the leader) while maintaining a safe distance from its neighbors. Many prior works have analyzed various controllers for platooning, most commonly linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for learning a stable, safe, distributed controller for a heterogeneous platoon. Our algorithm relies on recent developments in learning neural network stability certificates. We train a controller for autonomous platooning in simulation and evaluate its performance on hardware with a platoon of four F1Tenth vehicles. We then perform further analysis in simulation with a platoon of 100 vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the algorithm and the learned controller by comparing the performance of the neural network controller to linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers.</description>
