      <title>Center Manifolds and Normal Forms for Nonlinearly Periodically Forced DDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an effective framework for analysing bifurcations of equilibria in nonlinearly periodically forced delay differential equations. First, we establish the existence of a periodic smooth finite-dimensional center manifold near a nonhyperbolic equilibrium using the rigorous functional analytic framework of dual semigroups (sun-star calculus). Second, we construct a center manifold parametrization that allows us to describe the local dynamics on the center manifold near the equilibrium in terms of periodically forced normal forms. Third, we present a normalization method to derive explicit computational formulas for the critical normal form coefficients at a bifurcation of interest. In particular, we obtain such formulas for the periodically forced fold and nonresonant Hopf bifurcation. Several examples and indications from the literature confirm the validity and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Gibbs inequality for continuous potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Gibbs inequality, which says that the Gibbs ratio is bounded above and below by positive constants, holds for the unique equilibrium states of H\"older continuous potentials on shift spaces, but it can fail for continuous potentials. In this article, we study the validity of a weaker form of the Gibbs inequality in this broader setting.</description>

      <title>Multiscale feedback drives viral evolution and epidemic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal multiscale framework that links within-host virus dynamics to population-level SIRS epidemiology through explicit, bidirectional coupling. At the microscopic layer, a two variant quasispecies (master and mutant genomes with packaged virions) evolves on a fast timescale. At the macroscopic layer, two infectious classes (master- and mutant-infected), susceptible, recovered, and deceased individuals evolve slowly. The two scales are connected through transmission rates that depend on instantaneous virion abundance and through prevalence-weighted effective replication rates. Exploiting the timescale separation, we formalize a coarse-grained slow-fast closure: the genome-virion subsystem rapidly relaxes to quasi-steady states that parameterize time-varying transmission in the slow epidemiological system. This yields an integrated expression for the basic reproduction number and sharp inequalities that delineate coexistence versus exclusion. A key prediction is a context-dependent error threshold that shifts with the prevalence ratio, enabling transient pseudo-error catastrophes driven by epidemic composition rather than intrinsic fidelity. Linearization reveals parameter regions with damped oscillations arising solely from the microscopic-macroscopic feedback. Two illustrative extremes bracket the model's behavior: an avirulent strongly immunizing strain that benignly replaces the master, and a hypervirulent weakly immunizing that self-limits via host depletion and collapses transmission. This framework yields testable signatures linking viral load, incidence, and within-host composition.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas and data-driven discovery of stochastic dynamical systems with multiplicative L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional data-driven methods, effective for deterministic systems or stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with Gaussian noise, fail to handle the discontinuous sample paths and heavy-tailed fluctuations characteristic of L\'evy processes, particularly when the noise is state-dependent. To bridge this gap, we establish nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas, rigorously generalizing the classical Kramers-Moyal relations to SDEs with multiplicative L\'evy noise. These formulas provide a direct link between short-time transition probability densities (or sample path statistics) and the underlying SDE coefficients: the drift vector, diffusion matrix, L\'evy jump measure kernel, and L\'evy noise intensity functions. Leveraging these theoretical foundations, we develop novel data-driven algorithms capable of simultaneously identifying all governing components from data and establish convergence results and error analysis for the algorithms. We validate the framework through extensive numerical experiments on prototypical systems. This work provides a principled and practical toolbox for discovering interpretable SDE models governing complex systems influenced by discontinuous, heavy-tailed, state-dependent fluctuations, with broad applicability in climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, finance, and biological physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of composition operators induced by odometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear dynamics of composition operators induced by measurable transformations on finite measure spaces, with particular emphasis on operators induced by odometers. Our first main result shows that, on a finite measure space, supercyclicity of a composition operator implies hypercyclicity. This phenomenon has no analogue in several classical settings and highlights a rigidity specific to the finite-measure context.
  We then focus on composition operators induced by odometers and show that many dynamical properties that are distinct for weighted backward shifts collapse in this setting. In particular, for such operators, supercyclicity, Li-Yorke chaos, hypercyclicity, weak mixing, and Devaney chaos are all equivalent.
  In contrast to this collapse, we show that the classical equivalence between Devaney chaos and the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion for weighted backward shifts fails for odometers. Specifically, we construct a mixing, chaotic, and distributionally chaotic composition operator that does not satisfy the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion. This combination of rigidity and separation demonstrates that the dynamical behavior of composition operators induced by odometers differs sharply from that of weighted backward shifts.</description>

      <title>Stroboscopic motion reversals in delay-coupled neural fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual illusions provide a window into the mechanisms underlying visual processing, and dynamical neural circuit models offer a natural framework for proposing and testing theories of their emergence. We propose and analyze a delay-coupled neural field model that explains stroboscopic percepts arising from the subsampling of a moving, often rotating, stimulus, such as the wagon-wheel illusion. Motivated by the role of activity propagation delays in shaping visual percepts, we study neural fields with both uniform and spatially dependent delays, representing the finite time required for signals to travel along axonal projections. Each module is organized as a ring of neurons encoding angular preference, with instantaneous local coupling and delayed long-range coupling strongest between neurons with similar preference. We show that delays generate a family of coexisting traveling bump solutions with distinct, quantized propagation speeds. Using interface-based asymptotic methods, we reduce the neural field dynamics to a low-dimensional system of coupled delay differential equations, enabling a detailed analysis of speed selection, stability, entrainment, and state transitions. Regularly pulsed inputs induce transitions between distinct speed states, including motion opposite to the forcing direction, capturing key features of visual aliasing and stroboscopic motion reversal. These results demonstrate how delayed neural interactions organize perception into discrete dynamical states and provide a mechanistic explanation for stroboscopic visual illusions.</description>

      <title>A refined nonlinear least-squares method for the rational approximation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational approximation is a widely used method for the efficient construction of highly accurate rational approximations to given data. While AAA can often produce rational approximations accurate to any prescribed tolerance, these approximations may have degrees larger than what is actually required to meet the given tolerance. In this work, we consider the adaptive construction of interpolating rational approximations while aiming for the smallest feasible degree to satisfy a given error tolerance. To this end, we introduce refinement approaches to the linear least-squares step of the classical AAA algorithm that aim to minimize the true nonlinear least-squares error with respect to the given data. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the derived approaches in terms of the corresponding gradients from the resulting minimization problems and use these insights to propose a new greedy framework that ensures monotonic error convergence. Numerical examples from function approximation and model order reduction verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to construct accurate rational approximations of small degrees.</description>

      <title>Critically fixed Thurston maps: classification, recognition, and twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An orientation-preserving branched covering map $f\colon S^2 \to S^2$ is called a critically fixed Thurston map if $f$ fixes each of its critical points. It was recently shown that there is an explicit one-to-one correspondence between M\"obius conjugacy classes of critically fixed rational maps and isomorphism classes of planar embedded connected graphs. In the paper, we generalize this result to the whole family of critically fixed Thurston maps. Namely, we show that each critically fixed Thurston map $f$ is obtained by applying the blow-up operation, introduced by Kevin Pilgrim and Tan Lei, to a pair $(G,\varphi)$, where $G$ is a planar embedded graph in $S^2$ without isolated vertices and $\varphi$ is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of $S^2$ that fixes each vertex of $G$. This result allows us to provide a classification of combinatorial equivalence classes of critically fixed Thurston maps. We also develop an algorithm that reconstructs (up to isotopy) the pair $(G,\varphi)$ associated with a critically fixed Thurston map $f$. Finally, we solve some special instances of the twisting problem for the family of critically fixed Thurston maps obtained by blowing up pairs $(G, \mathrm{id}_{S^2})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to the classical Hopf Decomposition (also known as the conservative--dissipative decomposition) for actions of locally compact second countable groups. While the decomposition is well understood for free actions of countable groups, the extension to general actions requires new techniques and structural insights, particularly concerning recurrence and transience, cocycle behavior, and the structure of stabilizers. We establish several new characterizations and prove a structure theorem for totally dissipative actions, generalizing Krengel's classical result for flows.</description>

      <title>Feedback control of the Kuramoto model defined on uniform graphs I: Deterministic natural frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study feedback control of the Kuramoto model with uniformly spaced natural frequencies defined on uniform graphs which may be complete, random dense or random sparse. The control objective is to drive all nodes to the same constant rotational motion. For the case of node number $n\ge 3$, we establish the existence of exactly $2^n$ synchronized solutions in the controlled Kuramoto model (CKM) and their saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcations, and determine their stability. In particular, we show that only a solution converging to the desired motion in the limit of infinite feedback gain is stable and the others are unstable. Based on the previous results, it is shown that (i) the solution to which the stable synchronized solution in the CKM converge as $n\to\infty$ is always asymptotically stable in the continuous limit (CL) if it exists, and (ii) the asymptotically stable solution of the CL captures the asymptotic behavior of the CKM when the node number is sufficiently large, even if the graphs are random dense or sparse. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the CKM on complete simple, and uniform random dense and sparse graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an effective algorithmic method for the computation of a lower bound for uniform expansion in one-dimensional dynamics. The approach employs interval arithmetic and thus provides a rigorous numerical result (computer-assisted proof). The method uses efficient graph algorithms and an iterative approach for optimal performance. A software implementation of the method is made publicly available. This is an example of a quantitative result in the theory of dynamical systems, as opposed to many qualitative results whose assumptions may be difficult to verify and the conclusions may have limited use in practical models that describe natural phenomena. We discuss and illustrate the effectiveness of our method and apply it to the quadratic map family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial Kepler problem with a perturbation satisfying the rotational symmetry w.r.t. the $z$-axis and the reflection symmetry w.r.t. the $(x, y)$-plane, can be reduced to an Hamiltonian system with 2 degrees of freedom after fixing the angular momentum. For small enough perturbations, we show that for certain choices of energy and angular momentum, the corresponding energy surface is compact and diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^3$, and on each compact energy surface there is a unique $z$-symmetric brake orbit, which forms a Hopf link with a planar relative periodic orbit. Moreover under some additional technical assumptions, by applying recent results from symplectic dynamics (\cite{CHHL23}) and Franks' Theorem, we prove there are infinitely many relative periodic orbits on each compact energy surface. These results can be applied to the motion of a satellite around a uniformly mass-distributed ellipsoid and the $n$-pyramidal problem, where one point mass moves along the $z$-axis and $n$ other equal point masses form a regular $n$-gon perpendicular to the $z$-axis.</description>

      <title>Intermediate topological pressures and variational principles for nonautonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a one-parameter family of intermediate topological pressures for nonautonomous dynamical systems which interpolate between the Pesin-Pitskel topological pressure and the lower and upper capacity pressures. The construction is based on the Carath\'eodory-Pesin structure in which all admissible strings in a covering satisfy $ N \le n &lt; N/\theta + 1 $, where $ \theta \in [0,1] $ is a parameter. The extremal cases $\theta=0$ and $\theta=1$ recover the Pesin-Pitskel pressure and the two capacity pressures, respectively. We first investigate several properties of the intermediate pressure, including proving that it is continuous on $(0, 1]$ but may fail to be continuous at $0$, as well as establishing the power rule and monotonicity. We then derive inequalities for intermediate pressures with respect to the factor map. Finally, we introduce intermediate measure-theoretic pressures and prove variational principles relating them to the corresponding topological pressures.</description>

Abstract: We consider the dynamics of $n$ points on a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \geq 2$) which attract each other according to a function $\varphi$ of their inner products. When $\varphi$ is linear ($\varphi(t) = t$), the points converge to a common value (i.e., synchronize) in various connectivity scenarios: this is part of classical work on Kuramoto oscillator networks. When $\varphi$ is exponential ($\varphi(t) = e^{\beta t}$), these dynamics correspond to a limit of how idealized transformers process data, as described by Geshkovski et al. (2025). Accordingly, they ask whether synchronization occurs for exponential $\varphi$.
  The answer depends on the dimension $d$. In the context of consensus for multi-agent control, Markdahl et al. (2018) show that for $d \geq 3$ (spheres), if the interaction graph is connected and $\varphi$ is increasing and convex, then the system synchronizes. We give a separate proof of this result.
  What is the situation on circles ($d=2$)? First, we show that $\varphi$ being increasing and convex is no longer sufficient (even for complete graphs). Then we identify a new condition under which we do have synchronization on the circle (namely, if the Taylor coefficients of $\varphi'$ are decreasing). As a corollary, this provide synchronization for exponential $\varphi$ with $\beta \in (0, 1]$. The proofs are based on nonconvex landscape analysis.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for the Winding Number of Low-Lying Closed Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the winding of low-lying closed geodesics on the modular surface has a Gaussian limiting distribution when normalized by any standard notion of length, in contrast to the Cauchy distribution arising when allowing arbitrarily deep excursions into the cusp. In addition, we prove a Berry-Esseen bound and a local limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Extending the Droplet-Wave Statistical Correspondence in Walking Droplet Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Walking droplets -- millimetric oil droplets that self-propel across the surface of a vibrating fluid bath -- exhibit striking emergent statistics that remain only partially understood. In particular, in a variety of experiments, a robust correspondence has been observed between the droplet's statistical distribution and the time-average of the wave field that guides it. M. Durey, P. A. Milewski, and J. W. M. Bush, Chaos 28, 096108 (2018) rigorously established such a correspondence for single-droplet systems with a single, instantaneous droplet-bath impact during each vibration period, but numerical and experimental evidence suggests that the correspondence should hold far more broadly. Laboratory droplet systems, for instance, often exhibit complex bouncing modes that do not adhere to these hypotheses. We attempt to complete this program in the present work, rigorously extending this statistical correspondence to account for arbitrary droplet-bath impact models, multi-droplet interactions, and non-resonant bouncing. We investigate this correspondence numerically in systems of one and two droplets in 1-D geometries, and we highlight how the time-averaged wave field can distinguish between correlated and uncorrelated pairs of droplets.</description>
