      <title>Knowledge engineering for open science: Building and deploying knowledge bases for metadata standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientists strive to make their datasets available in open repositories, with the goal that they be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Although it is hard for most investigators to remember all the guiding principles associated with FAIR data, there is one overarching requirement: The data need to be annotated with rich, discipline-specific, standardized metadata. The Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) builds technology that enables scientists to encode metadata standards as templates that enumerate the attributes of different kinds of experiments. These metadata templates capture preferences regarding how data should be described and what a third party needs to know to make sense of the datasets. CEDAR templates describing community metadata preferences have been used to standardize metadata for a variety of scientific consortia. They have been used as the basis for data-annotation systems that acquire metadata through Web forms or through spreadsheets, and they can help correct metadata to ensure adherence to standards. Like the declarative knowledge bases that underpinned intelligent systems decades ago, CEDAR templates capture the knowledge in symbolic form, and they allow that knowledge to be applied in a variety of settings. They provide a mechanism for scientific communities to create shared metadata standards and to encode their preferences for the application of those standards, and for deploying those standards in a range of intelligent systems to promote open science.</description>

      <title>Presenting a classifier to detect research contributions in OpenAlex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a document type classifier with the purpose to optimise the distinction between research and non-research journal publications in OpenAlex. Based on open metadata, the classifier can detect non-research or editorial content within a set of classified articles and reviews (e.g. paratexts, abstracts, editorials, letters). The classifier achieves an F1-score of 0,95, indicating a potential improvement in the data quality of bibliometric research in OpenAlex when applying the classifier on real data. In total, 4.589.967 out of 42.701.863 articles and reviews could be reclassified as non-research contributions by the classifier, representing a share of 10,75%</description>

      <title>Tracking research software outputs in the UK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research software is crucial in the research process and the growth of Open Science underscores the importance of accessing research artifacts, like data and code, raising traceability challenges among outputs. While it is a clear principle that research code, along with other essential outputs, should be recognised as artifacts of the research process, the how of this principle remains variable. This study examines where UK academic institutions store and register software as a unique research output, searching the UKRI's Gateway to Research (GtR) metadata for publicly funded research software in the UK. The quantity of software reported as research outcomes remains low in proportion to other categories. Artifact sharing appears low, with one-quarter of the reported software having no links and 45% having either a missing or erroneous URL. Of the valid URLs, we find the single largest category is Public Commercial Code Repository, with GitHub being the host of 18% of all publicly funded research software listed. These observations are contrasted with past findings from 2023 and finally, we discuss the lack of artifact sharing in UK research, with resulting implications for the maintenance and evolution of research software. Without dissemination, research software risks demotion to a transient artifact, useful only to meet short term research demands but ultimately lost to the broader enterprise of science.</description>
