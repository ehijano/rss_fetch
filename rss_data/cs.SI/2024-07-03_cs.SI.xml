      <title>Exploring the Role of Randomization on Belief Rigidity in Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People often stick to their existing beliefs, ignoring contradicting evidence or only interacting with those who reinforce their views. Social media platforms often facilitate such tendencies of homophily and echo-chambers as they promote highly personalized content to maximize user engagement. However, increased belief rigidity can negatively affect real-world policy decisions such as leading to climate change inaction and increased vaccine hesitancy. To understand and effectively tackle belief rigidity on online social networks, designing and evaluating various intervention strategies is crucial, and increasing randomization in the network can be considered one such intervention. In this paper, we empirically quantify the effects of a randomized social network structure on belief rigidity, specifically examining the potential benefits of introducing randomness into the network. We show that individuals' beliefs are positively influenced by peer opinions, regardless of whether those opinions are similar to or differ from their own by passively sensing belief rigidity through our experimental framework. Moreover, people incorporate a slightly higher variety of different peers (based on their opinions) into their networks when the recommendation algorithm provides them with diverse content, compared to when it provides them with similar content. Our results indicate that in some cases, there might be benefits to randomization, providing empirical evidence that a more randomized network could be a feasible way of helping people get out of their echo-chambers. Our findings have broader implications in computing and platform design of social media, and can help combat overly rigid beliefs in online social networks.</description>

      <title>CGAP: Urban Region Representation Learning with Coarsened Graph Attention Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion of massive urban data recently has provided us with a valuable opportunity to gain deeper insights into urban regions and the daily lives of residents. Urban region representation learning emerges as a crucial realm for fulfilling this task. Among deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise, given that city elements can be naturally represented as nodes with various connections between them as edges. However, many existing GNN approaches encounter challenges such as over-smoothing and limitations in capturing information from nodes in other regions, resulting in the loss of crucial urban information and a decline in region representation performance. To address these challenges, we leverage urban graph structure information and introduce a hierarchical graph pooling process called Coarsened Graph Attention Pooling (CGAP). CGAP features local attention units to create coarsened intermediate graphs and global features. Additionally, by incorporating urban region graphs and global features into a global attention layer, we harness relational information to enhance representation effectiveness. Furthermore, CGAP integrates region attributes such as Points of Interest (POIs) and inter-regional contexts like human mobility, enabling the exploitation of multi-modal urban data for more comprehensive representation learning. Experiments on three downstream tasks related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals validate the effectiveness of region representations learned by our approach. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that CGAP excels in various socioeconomic prediction tasks compared to competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>A systematic comparison of measures for k-anonymity in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-aware sharing of network data is a difficult task due to the interconnectedness of individuals in networks. An important part of this problem is the inherently difficult question of how in a particular situation the privacy of an individual node should be measured. To that end, in this paper we propose a set of aspects that one should consider when choosing a measure for privacy. These aspects include the type of desired privacy and attacker scenario against which the measure protects, utility of the data, the type of desired output, and the computational complexity of the chosen measure. Based on these aspects, we provide a systematic overview of existing approaches in the literature. We then focus on a set of measures that ultimately enables our objective: sharing the anonymized full network dataset with limited disclosure risk. The considered measures, each based on the concept of k-anonymity, account for the structure of the surroundings of a certain node and differ in completeness and reach of the structural information taken into account. We present a comprehensive theoretical characterization as well as comparative empirical experiments on a wide range of real-world network datasets with up to millions of edges. We find that the choice of the measure has an enormous effect on aforementioned aspects. Most interestingly, we find that the most effective measures consider a greater node vicinity, yet utilize minimal structural information and thus use minimal computational resources. This finding has important implications for researchers and practitioners, who may, based on the recommendations given in this paper, make an informed choice on how to safely share large-scale network data in a privacy-aware manner.</description>

      <title>A Proposal for a FAIR Management of 3D Data in Cultural Heritage: The Aldrovandi Digital Twin Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we analyse 3D models of cultural heritage with the aim of answering three main questions: what processes can be put in place to create a FAIR-by-design digital twin of a temporary exhibition? What are the main challenges in applying FAIR principles to 3D data in cultural heritage studies and how are they different from other types of data (e.g. images) from a data management perspective? We begin with a comprehensive literature review touching on: FAIR principles applied to cultural heritage data; representation models; both Object Provenance Information (OPI) and Metadata Record Provenance Information (MRPI), respectively meant as, on the one hand, the detailed history and origin of an object, and - on the other hand - the detailed history and origin of the metadata itself, which describes the primary object (whether physical or digital); 3D models as cultural heritage research data and their creation, selection, publication, archival and preservation. We then describe the process of creating the Aldrovandi Digital Twin, by collecting, storing and modelling data about cultural heritage objects and processes. We detail the many steps from the acquisition of the Digital Cultural Heritage Objects (DCHO), through to the upload of the optimised DCHO onto a web-based framework (ATON), with a focus on open technologies and standards for interoperability and preservation. Using the FAIR Principles for Heritage Library, Archive and Museum Collections as a framework, we look in detail at how the Digital Twin implements FAIR principles at the object and metadata level. We then describe the main challenges we encountered and we summarise what seem to be the peculiarities of 3D cultural heritage data and the possible directions for further research in this field.</description>

      <title>HC-GLAD: Dual Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to its significance. However, most existing methods only rely on traditional graph neural networks to explore pairwise relationships but such kind of pairwise edges are not enough to describe multifaceted relationships involving anomaly. There is an emergency need to exploit node group information which plays a crucial role in UGAD. In addition, most previous works ignore the global underlying properties (e.g., hierarchy and power-law structure) which are common in real-world graph datasets and therefore are indispensable factors on UGAD task. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (HC-GLAD in short). To exploit node group connections, we construct hypergraphs based on gold motifs and subsequently perform hypergraph convolution. Furthermore, to preserve the hierarchy of real-world graphs, we introduce hyperbolic geometry into this field and conduct both graph and hypergraph embedding learning in hyperbolic space with hyperboloid model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously apply hypergraph with node group connections and hyperbolic geometry into this field. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets of different fields demonstrate the superiority of HC-GLAD on UGAD task. The code is available at https://github.com/Yali-F/HC-GLAD.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Data Augmentation with Denoising Diffusion for Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical aspect of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is to enhance the node representations by aggregating node neighborhood information. However, when detecting anomalies, the representations of abnormal nodes are prone to be averaged by normal neighbors, making the learned anomaly representations less distinguishable. To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised Counterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which introduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to identify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For each identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model to translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous ones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood aggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through aggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations become more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that CAGAD significantly outperforms strong baselines, with an average improvement of 2.35% on F1, 2.53% on AUC-ROC, and 2.79% on AUC-PR.</description>

      <title>COMET: NFT Price Prediction with Wallet Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the non-fungible token (NFT) market flourishes, price prediction emerges as a pivotal direction for investors gaining valuable insight to maximize returns. However, existing works suffer from a lack of practical definitions and standardized evaluations, limiting their practical application. Moreover, the influence of users' multi-behaviour transactions that are publicly accessible on NFT price is still not explored and exhibits challenges. In this paper, we address these gaps by presenting a practical and hierarchical problem definition. This approach unifies both collection-level and token-level task and evaluation methods, which cater to varied practical requirements of investors. To further understand the impact of user behaviours on the variation of NFT price, we propose a general wallet profiling framework and develop a COmmunity enhanced Multi-bEhavior Transaction graph model, named COMET. COMET profiles wallets with a comprehensive view and considers the impact of diverse relations and interactions within the NFT ecosystem on NFT price variations, thereby improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments conducted in our deployed system demonstrate the superiority of COMET, underscoring its potential in the insight toolkit for NFT investors.</description>

      <title>Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</description>

      <title>Semiotics Networks Representing Perceptual Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every day, humans perceive objects and communicate these perceptions through various channels. In this paper, we present a computational model designed to track and simulate the perception of objects, as well as their representations as conveyed in communication.
  We delineate two fundamental components of our internal representation, termed "observed" and "seen", which we correlate with established concepts in computer vision, namely encoding and decoding. These components are integrated into semiotic networks, which simulate perceptual inference of object perception and human communication.
  Our model of object perception by a person allows us to define object perception by {\em a network}. We demonstrate this with an example of an image baseline classifier by constructing a new network that includes the baseline classifier and an additional layer. This layer produces the images "perceived" by the entire network, transforming it into a perceptualized image classifier. This facilitates visualization of the acquired network.
  Within our network, the image representations become more efficient for classification tasks when they are assembled and randomized. In our experiments, the perceptualized network outperformed the baseline classifier on MNIST training databases consisting of a restricted number of images.
  Our model is not limited to persons and can be applied to any system featuring a loop involving the processing from "internal" to "external" representations.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Feature and Topology Lightweighting: An Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression Method for Malicious Account Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ethereum has become one of the primary global platforms for cryptocurrency, playing an important role in promoting the diversification of the financial ecosystem. However, the relative lag in regulation has led to a proliferation of malicious activities in Ethereum, posing a serious threat to fund security. Existing regulatory methods usually detect malicious accounts through feature engineering or large-scale transaction graph mining. However, due to the immense scale of transaction data and malicious attacks, these methods suffer from inefficiency and low robustness during data processing and anomaly detection. In this regard, we propose an Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression method named TGC4Eth, which assists malicious account detection by lightweighting both features and topology of the transaction graph. At the feature level, we select transaction features based on their low importance to improve the robustness of the subsequent detection models against feature evasion attacks; at the topology level, we employ focusing and coarsening processes to compress the structure of the transaction graph, thereby improving both data processing and inference efficiency of detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGC4Eth significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing detection models while preserving the connectivity of the transaction graph. Furthermore, TGC4Eth enables existing detection models to maintain stable performance and exhibit high robustness against feature evasion attacks.</description>
