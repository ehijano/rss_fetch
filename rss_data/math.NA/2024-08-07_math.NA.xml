      <title>Decoupling methods for fluid-structure interaction with local time-stepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two global-in-time domain decomposition methods, namely the Steklov-Poincare method and the Robin method, for solving a fluid-structure interaction system. These methods allow us to formulate the coupled system as a space-time interface problem and apply iterative algorithms directly to the evolutionary problem. Each time-dependent subdomain problem is solved independently, which enables the use of different time discretization schemes and time step sizes in the subsystems. This leads to an efficient way of simulating time-dependent phenomena. We present numerical tests for both non-physical and physical problems, with various mesh sizes and time step sizes to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical Instability of Algebraic Rootfinding Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the most popular variants of all common algebraic multidimensional rootfinding algorithms are unstable by analyzing the conditioning of subproblems that are constructed at intermediate steps. In particular, we give multidimensional polynomial systems for which the conditioning of a subproblem can be worse than the conditioning of the original problem by a factor that grows exponentially with the number of variables.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic-preserving semi-Lagrangian algorithm for the anisotropic heat transport equation with arbitrary magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently proposed semi-Lagrangian algorithm for the extremely anisotropic heat transport equation [Chac\'on et al., J. Comput. Phys., 272 (2014)] to deal with arbitrary magnetic field topologies. The original scheme (which showed remarkable numerical properties) was valid for the so-called tokamak-ordering regime, in which the magnetic field magnitude was not allowed to vary much along field lines. The proposed extension maintains the attractive features of the original scheme (including the analytical Green's function, which is critical for tractability) with minor modifications, while allowing for completely general magnetic fields. The accuracy and generality of the approach are demonstrated by numerical experiment with an analytical manufactured solution.</description>

      <title>On the construction of scattering matrices for irregular or elongated enclosures using Green's representation formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple scattering methods are widely used to reduce the computational complexity of acoustic or electromagnetic scattering problems when waves propagate through media containing many identical inclusions. Historically, this numerical technique has been limited to situations in which the inclusions (particles) can be covered by nonoverlapping disks in two dimensions or spheres in three dimensions. This allows for the use of separation of variables in cylindrical or spherical coordinates to represent the solution to the governing partial differential equation. Here, we provide a more flexible approach, applicable to a much larger class of geometries. We use a Green's representation formula and the associated layer potentials to construct incoming and outgoing solutions on rectangular enclosures. The performance and flexibility of the resulting scattering operator formulation in two-dimensions is demonstrated via several numerical examples for multi-particle scattering in free space as well as in layered media. The mathematical formalism extends directly to the three dimensional case as well, and can easily be coupled with several commercial numerical PDE software packages.</description>

      <title>Numerical Ergodicity of Stochastic Allen--Cahn Equation driven by Multiplicative White Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the unique ergodicity of a fully discrete scheme for monotone SPDEs with polynomial growth drift and bounded diffusion coefficients driven by multiplicative white noise. The main ingredient of our method depends on the satisfaction of a Lyapunov condition followed by a uniform moments' estimate, combined with the irreducibility and the strong Feller property for full discretization. We transform the original stochastic equation into an equivalent random equation where the discrete stochastic convolutions are uniformly controlled to derive the desired uniform moments' estimate. Applying the main result to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation driven by multiplicative white noise indicates that this full discretization is uniquely ergodic for any interface thickness. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Flexible Quaternion Generalized Minimal Residual Method for Ill-Posed Quaternion Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to propose a new quaternion total variation regularization model for solving linear ill-posed quaternion inverse problems, which arise from three-dimensional signal filtering or color image processing. The quaternion total variation term in the model is represented by collaborative total variation regularization and approximated by a quaternion iteratively reweighted norm. A novel flexible quaternion generalized minimal residual method is presented to quickly solve this model. An improved convergence theory is established to obtain a sharp upper bound of the residual norm of quaternion minimal residual method (QGMRES). The convergence theory is also presented for preconditioned QGMRES. Numerical experiments indicate the superiority of the proposed model and algorithms over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of iteration steps, CPU time, and the quality criteria of restored color images.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic error analysis of limited-precision stochastic rounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical probabilistic rounding error analysis is particularly well suited to stochastic rounding (SR), and it yields strong results when dealing with floating-point algorithms that rely heavily on summation. For many numerical linear algebra algorithms, one can prove probabilistic error bounds that grow as O(nu), where n is the problem size and u is the unit roundoff. These probabilistic bounds are asymptotically tighter than the worst-case ones, which grow as O(nu). For certain classes of algorithms, SR has been shown to be unbiased. However, all these results were derived under the assumption that SR is implemented exactly, which typically requires a number of random bits that is too large to be suitable for practical implementations. We investigate the effect of the number of random bits on the probabilistic rounding error analysis of SR. To this end, we introduce a new rounding mode, limited-precision SR. By taking into account the number r of random bits used, this new rounding mode matches hardware implementations accurately, unlike the ideal SR operator generally used in the literature. We show that this new rounding mode is biased and that the bias is a function of r. As r approaches infinity, however, the bias disappears, and limited-precision SR converges to the ideal, unbiased SR operator. We develop a novel model for probabilistic error analysis of algorithms employing SR. Several numerical examples corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rewrite the standard nodal virtual element method as a generalised gradient method. This re-formulation allows for computing a reliable and efficient error estimator by locally reconstructing broken fluxes and potentials. We prove the usual upper and lower bounds with constants independent of the stabilisation of the method and, under technical assumptions on the mesh, the degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>A spectral method for dispersive solutions of the nonlocal Sine-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moved by the pressing need for rigorous and reliable numerical tools for the analysis of peridynamic materials, the authors propose a model able to capture the dispersive features of nonlocal soliton like solutions obtained by a peridynamic formulation of the Sine-Gordon equation. The analysis of the Cauchy problem associated to the peridynamic Sine Gordon equation with local Neumann boundary condition is performed in this work through a spectral method on Chebyshev polynomials nodes joined with the Stormer Verlet scheme for the time evolution. The choice for using the spectral method resides in the resulting reachable numerical accuracy, while, indeed, Chebyshev polynomials allow straightforward implementation of local boundary conditions. Several numerical experiments are proposed for thoroughly describe the ability of such scheme. Specifically, dispersive effects as well as the ability of preserving the internal energy of the specific peridynamic kernel are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Back-Projection Diffusion: Solving the Wideband Inverse Scattering Problem with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textit{Wideband back-projection diffusion}, an end-to-end probabilistic framework for approximating the posterior distribution induced by the inverse scattering map from wideband scattering data. This framework leverages conditional diffusion models coupled with the underlying physics of wave-propagation and symmetries in the problem, to produce highly accurate reconstructions. The framework introduces a factorization of the score function into a physics-based latent representation inspired by the filtered back-propagation formula and a conditional score function conditioned on this latent representation. These two steps are also constrained to obey symmetries in the formulation while being amenable to compression by imposing the rank structure found in the filtered back-projection formula. As a result, empirically, our framework is able to provide sharp reconstructions effortlessly, even recovering sub-Nyquist features in the multiple-scattering regime. It has low-sample and computational complexity, its number of parameters scales sub-linearly with the target resolution, and it has stable training dynamics.</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of a Multi-Population Mean Field Games with non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a MFG model with quadratic Hamiltonian involving $N$ populations. This results in a system of $N$ Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and $N$ Fokker-Planck equations with non-local interactions. As in the classical case we introduce an Eulerian variational formulation which, despite the non convexity of the interaction, still gives a weak solution to the MFG model. The problem can be reformulated in Lagrangian terms and solved numerically by a Sinkhorn-like scheme. We present numerical results based on this approach, these simulations exhibit different behaviours depending on the nature (repulsive or attractive) of the non-local interaction.</description>

  in the case of real Banach spaces. Recently, some of results proved for the Weak Chebyshev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in the case of real Banach spaces were extended to the case of complex Banach spaces. In this paper
  we extend some of known in the real case results for other than WCGA greedy algorithms to the case of complex Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of vector-valued functions by volume sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ and a finite measure space $\Omega$, the approximation of a vector-valued function $f: \Omega \to \mathcal H$ by a $k$-dimensional subspace $\mathcal U \subset \mathcal H$ plays an important role in dimension reduction techniques, such as reduced basis methods for solving parameter-dependent partial differential equations. For functions in the Lebesgue-Bochner space $L^2(\Omega;\mathcal H)$, the best possible subspace approximation error $d_k^{(2)}$ is characterized by the singular values of $f$. However, for practical reasons, $\mathcal U$ is often restricted to be spanned by point samples of $f$. We show that this restriction only has a mild impact on the attainable error; there always exist $k$ samples such that the resulting error is not larger than $\sqrt{k+1} \cdot d_k^{(2)}$. Our work extends existing results by Binev at al. (SIAM J. Math. Anal., 43(3):1457-1472, 2011) on approximation in supremum norm and by Deshpande et al. (Theory Comput., 2:225-247, 2006) on column subset selection for matrices.</description>

Abstract: The main objective of the present paper is to construct a new class of space-time discretizations for the stochastic $p$-Stokes system and analyze its stability and convergence properties.
  We derive regularity results for the approximation that are similar to the natural regularity of solutions. One of the key arguments relies on discrete extrapolation that allows to relate lower moments of discrete maximal processes.
  We show that, if the generic spatial discretization is constraint conforming, then the velocity approximation satisfies a best-approximation property in the natural distance.
  Moreover, we present an example such that the resulting velocity approximation converges with rate $1/2$ in time and $1$ in space towards the (unknown) target velocity with respect to the natural distance. The theory is corroborated by numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the classic matrix cross approximation based on the maximal volume submatrices. Our main results consist of an improvement of the classic estimate for matrix cross approximation and a greedy approach for finding the maximal volume submatrices. More precisely, we present a new proof of the classic estimate of the inequality with an improved constant. Also, we present a family of greedy maximal volume algorithms to improve the computational efficiency of matrix cross approximation. The proposed algorithms are shown to have theoretical guarantees of convergence. Finally, we present two applications: image compression and the least squares approximation of continuous functions. Our numerical results at the end of the paper demonstrate the effective performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods Using Tensor-Product Summation-by-Parts Operators on Triangles and Tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new class of efficient and robust discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws on curved triangular and tetrahedral unstructured grids. Such discretizations employ a recently introduced family of sparse tensor-product summation-by-parts (SBP) operators in collapsed coordinates within an entropy-stable modal formulation. The proposed algorithms exploit the structure of such SBP operators alongside that of the Proriol-Koornwinder-Dubiner polynomial basis, and a weight-adjusted approximation is used to efficiently invert the local mass matrix for curvilinear elements. Using such techniques, the number of required entropy-conservative two-point flux evaluations between pairs of quadrature nodes is significantly reduced relative to existing entropy-stable formulations using (non-tensor-product) multidimensional SBP operators, particularly for high polynomial degrees, with an improvement in time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(p^{2d})$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^{d+1})$, where $p$ is the polynomial degree of the approximation and $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions. In numerical experiments involving smooth solutions to the compressible Euler equations, the proposed tensor-product schemes demonstrate similar levels of accuracy for a given mesh and polynomial degree to those using multidimensional SBP operators based on symmetric quadrature rules. Furthermore, both operator families are shown to give rise to entropy-stable methods which exhibit excellent robustness for under-resolved problems. Such results suggest that the algorithmic advantages resulting from the use of tensor-product operators are obtained without compromising accuracy or robustness, enabling the efficient extension of the benefits of entropy stability to higher polynomial degrees than previously considered for triangular and tetrahedral elements.</description>

      <title>A Finite Difference Scheme for (2+1)D Cubic-Quintic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Nonlinear Damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solitons of the purely cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a space dimension of $n \geq 2$ suffer critical and supercritical collapses. These solitons can be stabilized in a cubic-quintic nonlinear medium. In this paper, we analyze the Crank-Nicolson finite difference scheme for the (2+1)D cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with cubic damping. We show that both the discrete solution, in the discrete $L^2$-norm, and discrete energy are bounded. By using appropriate settings and estimations, the existence and the uniqueness of the numerical solution are proved. In addition, the error estimations are established in terms of second order for both space and time in discrete $L^2$-norm and $H^1$-norm. Numerical simulations for the (2+1)D cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with cubic damping are conducted to validate the convergence.</description>

      <title>Low-Frequency Stabilizations of the PMCHWT Equation for Dielectric and Conductive Media: On a Full-Wave Alternative to Eddy-Current Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose here a novel stabilization strategy for the PMCHWT equation that cures its frequency and conductivity related instabilities and is obtained by leveraging quasi-Helmholtz projectors. The resulting formulation is well-conditioned in the entire low-frequency regime, including the eddy current one, and can be applied to arbitrarily penetrable materials, ranging from dielectric to conductive ones. In addition, by choosing the rescaling coefficients of the quasi-Helmholtz components appropriately, we prevent the typical loss of accuracy occurring at low frequency in the presence of inductive and capacitive type magnetic frill excitations, commonly used in circuit modeling to impose a potential difference. Finally, leveraging on quasi-Helmholtz projectors instead than on the standard Loop-Star decomposition, our formulation is also compatible with most fast solvers and is amenable to multiply connected geometries, without any computational overhead for the search for the global loops of the structure. The efficacy of the proposed preconditioning scheme when applied to both simply and multiply connected geometries is corroborated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Weak convergence analysis in the particle limit of the McKean--Vlasov equations using stochastic flows of particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a proof showing that the weak error of a system of $n$ interacting stochastic particles approximating the solution of the McKean-Vlasov equation is $\mathcal O(n^{-1})$. Our proof is based on the Kolmogorov backward equation for the particle system and bounds on the derivatives of its solution, which we derive more generally using the variations of the stochastic particle system. The convergence rate is verified by numerical experiments, which also indicate that the assumptions made here and in the literature can be relaxed.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry analysis of (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>
