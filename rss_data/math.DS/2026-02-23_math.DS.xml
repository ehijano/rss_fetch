      <title>Periodic orbits of reversible Lagrangian systems without self-intersections and Ma\~n\'e genericity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bernard [3] showed that a Ma\~n\'e generic convex Hamiltonian has only non-degenerate periodic orbits on a given energy level. We show that one can use this result to prove that for a generic potential the prime periodic orbits of fixed energy of a Lagrangian system of classical type on a compact manifold of dimension $n\ge 3$ do not have self-intersections and do not intersect each other.</description>

      <title>Mean-field dynamics of attractive resource interaction: From uniform to aggregated states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a nonlinear discrete dynamical system describing the evolution of a resource distribution among interacting agents. The model generalizes several classical mean-field and opinion-dynamics frameworks and is defined on the standard simplex, where each coordinate evolves according to an interaction rule depending on pairwise preference functions. We provide a complete analytical description of the long-term behavior of the system.</description>

      <title>Statistical Ensemble Deviation Estimates for Nearly Integrable Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies quantitative deviation bounds for statistical ensembles evolving under the one-parameter flow of a nearly integrable Hamiltonian system. Combining Nekhoroshev-type stability estimates with phase-mixing arguments, we obtain, for any observable $G$, an explicit upper bound on the deviation of the ensemble average $\langle G\rangle_t$ from its angular average $\langle \left\langle G \right\rangle_{\theta}\rangle_{0}$ over exponentially long time scales. The bound separates contributions from the resonant neighborhood via a probability-mass term, and from the nonresonant region via a traceable $1/t$ mixing constant $C_G$, a high-frequency Fourier tail, and an explicit normal-form remainder error.</description>

      <title>An embedding version of Rubin's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rubin's theorem asserts that if $\Gamma\curvearrowright X$ and $\Delta\curvearrowright Y$ are Rubin actions, then any group isomorphism $\Gamma \cong \Delta$ induces an equivariant homeomorphism $Y\cong X$. We provide an embedding version of Rubin's theorem highlighting group embeddings that induce a spatial equivariant map of a certain form. We further showcase instances of such embeddings between generalized Brin-Thompson groups.</description>

      <title>Entropy Density of Ergodic Nonadapted Measures for Markov Interval Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a uniformly expanding transitive Markov interval map, we show that within the set of ergodic measures the set of nonadapted ergodic measures is residual in with respect to the topology induced by the $\overline{d}$-metric. This set of measures is also shown to be path connected in many cases.</description>

      <title>Dynamical GCD Problems and a Variant of the Dynamical Mordell-Lang Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{NZ25}, the authors resolved the rational function analogue of the finiteness results for greatest common divisors of iterates of polynomials established in \cite{HT17}. These results may be viewed as dynamical generalizations of a classical problem concerning upper bounds for the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of two integer sequences studied by Bugeaud, Corvaja, and Zannier. The most delicate case arises when the maps involved are automorphisms, where the methods of \cite{NZ25} and \cite{HT17} rely heavily on Diophantine approximation and asymptotic analysis.
  In the present paper, we develop an alternative approach to the automorphism case. This method is more powerful, allowing us to give complete answers to the further questions posed in \cite{HT17}. In particular, we strengthen the main theorem of \cite{HT17} and provide an alternative proof of the main theorem of \cite{NZ25} in the automorphism setting.
  Moreover, we relate this dynamical GCD problem to a special case of a higher-dimensional generalization of the Dynamical Mordell--Lang Conjecture proposed by Junyi Xie. We establish this generalized conjecture when the dynamics arise from algebraic group actions. In addition, we resolve the corresponding special case associated with dynamical GCD questions when the maps involved are polynomials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Killing tensors and first integrals of the magnetic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a new family of symmetric tensors generalizing Killing tensors, that we call magnetic Killing symmetric tensors. We make use of them to construct first integrals for the magnetic flow associated to a given magnetic field. We apply the results to prove integrability of some invariant magnetic flows (either exact or non-exact) on some 2-step nilmanifolds: the Kodaira-Thurston manifold and Heisenberg nilmanifolds of higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Invariant sets for homeomorphisms of hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that under some assumptions on how points escape to infinity in the universal cover, homeomorphisms of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are forced to have several invariant sets (in particular, they cannot be minimal). For this, we use some shadowing techniques which, when the homeomorphism has positive speed with respect to a uniform foliation, allow us to obtain strong consequences on the structure of the invariant sets. We discuss also homological rotation sets and end the paper with some extensions to other manifolds as well as posing some general problems for the understanding of minimal homeomorphisms of 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for the pseudo-Riemannian geodesic flows of step-two nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper deals with the stability analysis for the geodesic flow of a step-two nilpotent Lie group equipped with a left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric. The Lie-Poisson equation can be described in terms of the so-called $j$-mapping, a linear operator associated to the step-two nilpotent Lie algebras equipped with the induced scalar product. The stability of equilibrium points for the Hamilton equation is determined in terms of their Williamson types.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Spectral Analysis Through Pseudo-Resolvent Koopman Operator in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for spectral analysis of the Koopman operator based on direct construction of the pseudo-resolvent from time-series data. Finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator, such as those obtained from Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, are known to suffer from spectral pollution. To address this issue, we construct the pseudo-resolvent operator using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity whose norm serves as a spectral indicator, and pseudoeigenfunctions are extracted as directions of maximal amplification. We establish convergence of the approximate spectrum to the true spectrum in the Hausdorff metric for isolated eigenvalues, with preservation of algebraic multiplicities, and derive error bounds for eigenvalue approximation. Numerical experiments on pendulum, Lorenz, and coupled oscillator systems demonstrate that the method effectively suppresses spectral pollution and resolves closely spaced spectral components.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Public Goods Game in Dynamical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolutionary mechanisms of cooperative behavior represent a fundamental topic in complex systems and evolutionary dynamics. Real-world collective interactions, particularly in multi-agent systems, are often characterized by behavior-dependent mechanism switching where the environmental state is endogenously shaped by group strategies. However, existing models typically treat such environmental variations as static stochasticity and neglect the closed-loop feedback between environmental states and cooperative behaviors. Here, we introduce a dynamic environmental feedback mechanism into a nonlinear public goods game framework to establish a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environmental feedback, nonlinear effects, and environmental randomness can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environmental feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory but also provides a foundation for modeling environmental feedback loops in scenarios ranging from ecological management to the design of cooperative mechanisms in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>A joint optimization approach to identifying sparse dynamics using least squares kernel collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an all-at-once modeling framework for learning systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) from scarce, partial, and noisy observations of the states. The proposed methodology amounts to a combination of sparse recovery strategies for the ODE over a function library combined with techniques from reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory for estimating the state and discretizing the ODE. Our numerical experiments reveal that the proposed strategy leads to significant gains in terms of accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness to noise, both in terms of learning the equation and estimating the unknown states. This work demonstrates capabilities well beyond existing and widely used algorithms while extending the modeling flexibility of other recent developments in equation discovery.</description>
