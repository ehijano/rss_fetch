      <title>Optimization of Postselection in Quantum Algorithms: A Two-Way Quantum Computing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postselection is an operation that allows the selection of specific measurement outcomes. It serves as a powerful theoretical tool for enhancing the performance of existing quantum algorithms. Despite recent developments such as time reversal in quantum measurements and IBM's mid-circuit measurements, postselection continues to face significant challenges, most notably poor, often exponential, scaling. This study investigates how Two-Way Quantum Computing (2WQC) offers potential solutions to these challenges. By introducing the concept of postparation and enabling dynamic quantum state control, 2WQC has the potential to mitigate scaling issues and improve the practicality of postselection, thereby fostering advancements in the field of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Causality in the maximally extended Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime with identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximally extended Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) spacetime with $e^2 &lt; m^2$ can be interpreted either as an infinite chain of asymptotically flat regions connected by tunnels between timelike singularities or as a set of just one asymptotically flat region and one tunnel; the repetitions of this set in the infinite chain being identified. The second interpretation gives rise to the suspicion of acausality, i.e. the possibility of sending messages to one's own past. A numerical investigation of this problem was carried out in this paper and gave the following result. Let E be the initial point of a radial timelike future-directed ingoing geodesic G, lying halfway between the outer horizon and the image of the null infinity in the maximally extended RN spacetime. Let E$'$ be the first future copy of E. It was verified whether the turning point of G will lie to the future or to the past from the past light cone (PLC) of E$'$. In the second case the breach of causality does occur. It turned out that the acausality is present when $V_E$, the timelike coordinate of E, is negative with a sufficiently large $|V_E|$, and is absent with a sufficiently large $V_E &gt; 0$. In between these values there exists a $\widetilde{V}_E$, dependent on the initial data for the geodesic, for which the turning point lies on the PLC. So, the identification does lead to acausality. Nonradial timelike and null geodesics were also investigated, and a few hitherto unknown properties of the maximal extension were revealed. For example, the singularity arc at $r = 0$ may be convex or concave, depending on the values of $m$ and $e$.</description>

      <title>Synchronizing Rhythms of Logic</title>

Abstract: Although quantum states nicely explain experiments, the outcomes of experiments are not states. Instead, outcomes correspond to probability distributions. Twenty years ago we proved categorically that probability distributions leave open a choice of quantum states to explain experiments that is resolvable only by a move beyond logic, which, inspired or not, can be characterized as a guess. Guesses link the inner lives of investigators to their explanations of experimental results. Recognizing the inescapability of guesswork in physics leads to avenues of investigation, one of which is presented here.
  We invert the quest for the logical foundations of physics to reveal a physical basis for logic and calculation, and we represent this basis mathematically, in such a way as to show the shaping and re-shaping of calculations by guesswork. We draw on the interplay between guessing and computation in digital contexts that, perhaps surprisingly, include living organisms. Digital computation and communication depend on a type of synchronization that coordinates transitions among physically distinct conditions represented by "digits." This logical synchronization, known to engineers but neglected in physics, requires guesswork for its maintenance. By abstracting digital hardware, we model the structure of human thinking as logically synchronized computation, punctuated by guesses.
  We adapt marked graphs to mathematically represent computation and represent guesses by unpredictable changes in these marked graphs. The marked graphs reveal a logical substructure to spatial and temporal navigation, with implications across physics and its biological applications. By limiting our model to the logical aspect of communications and computations we unveil logical structure in relation to guesswork, applicable not just to electronics but also to the functioning of living organisms.</description>
