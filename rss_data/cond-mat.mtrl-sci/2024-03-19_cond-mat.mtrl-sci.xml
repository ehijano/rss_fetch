      <title>One-shot pair distribution functions of thin films using lab-based x-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining accurate pair distribution functions of thin amorphous films down to 80 nm, using modern laboratory-based x-ray sources. The pair distribution functions are obtained using a single diffraction scan (one-shot) without the requirement of additional scans of the substrate or of the air. By using a crystalline substrate combined with an oblique scattering geometry, most of the Bragg scattering of the substrate is avoided, rendering the substrate Compton scattering the primary contribution. By utilizing a discriminating energy filter, available in the latest generation of modern detectors, we demonstrate that the Compton intensity can further be reduced to negligible levels at higher wavevector values. We minimize scattering from the sample holder and the air by the systematic selection of pixels in the detector image based on the projected detection footprint of the sample and the use of a 3D printed sample holder. Finally, x-ray optical effects in the absorption factors and the ratios between the Compton intensity of the substrate and film are taken into account by using a theoretical tool that simulates the electric field inside the film and the substrate, which aids in planning both the sample design and measurement protocol.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent ferroelectric-to-paraelectric sliding transformations and antipolar-to-ferroelectric topological phase transitions in binary homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ferroelectric behavior in few-layer materials, accompanied by the observation of antipolar domains in hexagonal boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e bilayers, is paving the way for revolutionary advancements in the generation and manipulation of intrinsic electric dipoles through stacking. In addition, these cutting-edge quantum materials are reshaping our comprehension of phase transitions. Within the present study, we unveil a hitherto unreported size-dependent sliding behavior that marks a significant departure from conventional ferroelectrics. We also shed light on thermally induced spontaneous hyperlubric sliding within moir\'e bilayers, which can be used as a signal to distinguish topological phase transitions from an antipolar onto a ferroelectric bilayer. Our findings also suggest that the (topological) pinning of AA nodes in antipolar moir\'e homobilayers prevents the occurrence of an antipolar-to-paraelectric transformation.</description>

      <title>Intervalence Plasmons in Boron-Doped Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doped semiconductors are capable of exhibiting metallic-like properties ranging from superconductivity to tunable localized surface plasmon resonances. Diamond is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is rendered electronically active by incorporating a hole dopant, boron. While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons, which could facilitate optical applications, has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low energy excitations is provided by scanning transmission electron microscope-valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and photoinduced force infrared spectroscopy. The measured loss and absorbance spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Remarkably, the calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a resonance characteristic of metallicity (narrow-banded negative values of the dielectric function). The energy of the zero-crossing and the position of the loss peak are found to coincide, and both increase with the carrier density. Our results provide insight into a new mechanism for inducing plasmon-like behavior in doped semiconductors from intervalence band transitions, and the possibility of attaining such properties in diamond, a key emerging material for biomedical and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Role of Helium Bubbles and Voids on the Property of Nanocrystalline Tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript embarks on an inquiry into the influence of helium implantation on nanocrystalline tungsten, a contender for plasma-facing components (PFCs) in nuclear fusion reactors. The study underscores the inevitability of helium retention in tungsten due to the anticipated high flux of helium atoms from D-T fusion reactions in future reactors such as ITER and DEMO. This retention, potentially culminating in surface blistering and grain boundary embrittlement, propels an investigation into the helium's preferential substitutional configuration over interstitial within tungsten's lattice, leading to cavity and bubble formation. Atomistic tensile testing simulations, exploiting a helium-specific interatomic potential, dissect the ramifications of helium concentration and voids on tungsten's mechanical properties across grain sizes of 10nm and 15nm. The presence of helium at grain boundaries instigates detachment, influencing structural behaviors under strain. Notably, the study reveals a dichotomy in helium's effect: benign at concentrations up to the critical point, beyond which significant embrittlement and elastic softening occur, corroborating with theoretical predictions on helium-induced grain boundary embrittlement. This nuanced exploration delineates the intricate dance between helium implantation levels, grain size, and the ensuing mechanical property alterations in nanocrystalline tungsten, casting light on its viability and endurance as a PFC material under the rigorous conditions forecasted in fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Primary Defect Production in Doped Iron Grain Boundaries during Low Energy Collision Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the intricate interactions between grain boundaries (GBs) and irradiation-induced defects in nanocrystalline iron, highlighting the role of dopants like copper. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the research delineates how GB properties, such as GB energy and defect formation energies, influence the formation and evolution of defects in low energy collision cascades. It reveals that GBs not only augment defect production but also show a marked preference for interstitials over vacancies, a behavior significantly modulated by the cascade's proximity to the GB. The presence of dopants is shown to alter GB properties, affecting both the rate and type of defect production, thereby underscoring the complex interplay between GB characteristics, dopant elements, and defect dynamics. Moreover, the investigation uncovers that the structural characteristics of GBs play a crucial role in cascade evolution and defect generation, with certain GB configurations undergoing reconfiguration in response to cascades. For instance, the reconfiguration of one pure Fe twist GB suggests that GB geometry can significantly influence defect generation mechanisms. These findings point to the potential of GB engineering in developing materials with enhanced radiation tolerance, advocating for a nuanced approach to material design. By tailoring GB properties and selectively introducing dopant elements, materials can be optimized to exhibit superior resistance to radiation-induced damage, offering insights for applications in nuclear reactors and other radiation-prone environments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Temperature on Irradiation Defect Evolution near Surfaces and Grain Boundaries in Tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of temperature on defect dynamics in tungsten, emphasizing its application in nuclear fusion reactors as Plasma Facing Components (PFCs). Through atomistic simulations, the research elucidates the intricate interplay of defect production, annihilation, and redistribution under irradiation at room (300K) and elevated temperatures (1000K). It demonstrates that higher temperatures significantly increase the number and mobility of defects, leading to a substantial rise in the total number of surviving Frenkel Pairs (FPs), with a notable preference for surface distribution. This redistribution is attributed to energy gradient-driven relocation processes, enhanced by the defects' increased mobility at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the study reveals that elevated temperatures promote biased accumulation of interstitial defects in grain boundaries, especially in configurations that facilitate efficient interstitial migration, indicating a strategy for minimizing lattice interstitial accumulation under irradiation. These findings underscore the critical role of temperature in modulating irradiation-induced defect dynamics in tungsten, providing valuable insights for designing and selecting materials with optimized irradiation resistance for use in extreme conditions of nuclear fusion reactors. The research suggests a material design approach that accounts for temperature effects to enhance the durability and performance of nuclear fusion materials.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Defect Production during Successive Displacement Cascades on a Tungsten Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the complex mechanisms of defect production and accumulation in nanocrystalline tungsten under irradiation, with a particular focus on the interplay between grain boundaries and free surfaces. Through molecular dynamics simulations, the research explores how grain boundaries act as sinks for irradiation-induced defects, a critical aspect in designing nanomaterials with enhanced radiation tolerance. The investigation leverages a novel Modified Wigner-Seitz Analysis to accurately quantify defect trends amidst dynamic surface reconstruction, providing a nuanced understanding of defect distribution in response to irradiation. This methodology underscores the intricate relationship between defect dynamics and the nano-scale structure of materials, specifically highlighting the role of interfaces in mediating these dynamics. The findings reveal a complex balance between defect production, surface interactions, and the influence of pre-existing defects and temperature on the primary defect production process. Surfaces are shown to amplify defect production due to biased accumulation of interstitials, alongside suppressed defect recombination, emphasizing the nuanced nature of defect dynamics in irradiated materials. This research contributes significantly to the fundamental understanding of defect formation and evolution in irradiated tungsten, offering insights that are instrumental in the development of nanomaterials poised for applications in extreme irradiation environments, such as fusion reactors, thereby advancing the field of materials science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Quasi-van der Waals Epitaxial Growth of {\gamma}'-GaSe Thin Films on GaAs(111)B Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GaSe is an important member of the post-transition metal chalcogenide family and is an emerging two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material. Because it is a van der Waals (vdW) material, it can be fabricated into atomic-scale ultrathin films, making it suitable for the preparation of compact, heterostructure devices. In addition, GaSe possesses unusual optical and electronic properties, such as a shift from an indirect-bandgap single-layer film to a direct-bandgap bulk material, rare intrinsic p-type conduction, and nonlinear optical behaviors. These properties make GaSe an appealing candidate for the fabrication of field-effect transistors, photodetectors, and photovoltaics. However, the wafer-scale production of pure GaSe single crystal thin films remains challenging. This study develops an approach for the direct growth of GaSe thin films on GaAs substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. It yields smooth thin GaSe films with a {\gamma}'-configuration, a recently-proposed novel polymorph. We analyze the formation mechanism of {\gamma}'-GaSe using density functional theory, finding that this polymorph is stabilized by Ga vacancies. Finally, we investigate the growth conditions of GaSe, providing valuable insights for exploring 2D/3D quasi-vdW epitaxial growth.</description>

      <title>On the interplay of liquid-like and stress-driven dynamics in a metallic glass former observed by temperature scanning XPCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern detector technology and highly brilliant fourth-generation synchrotrons allow to improve the temporal resolution in time-resolved diffraction studies. Profiting from this, we applied temperature scanning X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to probe the dynamics of a Pt-based metallic glass former in the glass, glass transition region, and supercooled liquid, covering up to six orders of magnitude in time scales. Our data demonstrates that the structural alpha-relaxation process is still observable in the glass, although it is partially masked by a faster source of decorrelation observed at atomic scale. We present an approach that interprets these findings as the superposition of heterogeneous liquid-like and stress-driven ballistic-like atomic motions. This work not only extends the dynamical range probed by standard isothermal XPCS, but also clarifies the fate of the alpha-relaxation across the glass transition and provides a new perception on the anomalous, compressed temporal decay of the density-density correlation functions observed in metallic glasses and many out-of-equilibrium soft materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-State, Ultra-thin, BEOL-Compatible AlScN Ferroelectric Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth in data generation necessitates efficient data processing technologies to address the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional computer architecture. Memory-driven computing, which integrates non-volatile memory (NVM) devices in a 3D stack, is gaining attention, with CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible ferroelectric (FE) diodes being ideal due to their two-terminal design and inherently selector-free nature, facilitating high-density crossbar arrays. Here, we demonstrate BEOL-compatible, high-performance FE-diodes scaled to 5, 10, and 20 nm FE Al0.72Sc0.28N/Al0.64Sc0.36N films. Through interlayer (IL) engineering, we show substantial improvements in the ON/OFF ratios (&gt;166 times) and rectification ratios (&gt;176 times) in these scaled devices. The superlative characteristics also enables 5-bit multi-state operation with a stable retention. We also experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the counterintuitive result that the inclusion of an IL can lead to a decrease in the ferroelectric switching voltage of the device. An in-depth analysis into the device transport mechanisms is performed, and our compact model aligns seamlessly with the experimental results. Our results suggest the possibility of using scaled AlxSc1-xN FE-diodes for high performance, low-power, embedded NVM.</description>

      <title>Electrical transport crossover and large magnetoresistance in selenium deficient van der Waals HfSe2-x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides have received much attention in the past decade not only due to the new fundamental physics, but also due to the emergent applications in these materials. Currently chalcogenide deficiencies in TMDs are commonly believed either during the high temperature growth procedure or in the nanofabrication process resulting significant changes of their reported physical properties in the literature. Here we perform a systematic study involving pristine stochiometric HfSe2, Se deficient HfSe1.9 and HfSe1.8. Stochiometric HfSe2 transport results show semiconducting behavior with a gap of 1.1eV. Annealing HfSe2 under high vacuum at room temperature causes the Se loss resulting in HfSe1.9, which shows unconventionally large magnetoresistivity following the extended Kohler's rule at low temperatures below 50 K. Moreover, a clear electrical resistivity crossover, mimicking the metal-insulator transition, is observed in the HfSe1.9 single crystal. Further increasing the degree of deficiency in HfSe1.8 results in complete metallic electrical transport at all temperatures down to 2K. Such a drastic difference in the transport behaviors of stoichiometric and Se-deficient HfSe2 further emphasizes that defect control and engineering could be an effective method that could be used to tailor the electronic structure of 2D materials, potentially unlock new states of matter, or even discover new materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Oxygen and Ozone on C2N Monolayer: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of environmental oxidation is pivotal in determining the physical and chemical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Its impact holds great significance for the practical application of these materials in nanoscale devices functioning under ambient conditions. This study delves into the influence of O2 and O3 exposure on the structural and electronic characteristics of the C2N monolayer, focusing on the kinetics of adsorption and dissociation reactions. Employing first-principles density functional theory calculations alongside climbing image nudged elastic band calculations, we observe that the C2N monolayer exhibits resistance to oxidation and ozonation, evidenced by energy barriers of 0.05 eV and 0.56 eV, respectively. These processes are accompanied by the formation of epoxide (C-O-C) groups. Furthermore, the dissociation mechanism involves charge transfers from the monolayer to the molecules. Notably, the dissociated configurations demonstrate higher bandgaps compared to the pristine C2N monolayer, attributed to robust C-O hybridization. These findings suggest the robustness of C2N monolayers against oxygen/ozone exposures, ensuring stability for devices incorporating these materials.</description>

      <title>Dielectric response in twisted MoS2 bilayer facilitated by spin-orbit coupling effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals bilayers provide ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms to study the interplay between spin and charge degree of freedom of electron. An exotic dielectric response behavior in such system is what we find here through the investigation of twisted bilayer MoS2 with two different stackings but same size of the commensurate supercell, which forms H-type like and R-type like stacked bilayer system. Our first-principles calculations show that applying an out-of-plane electric field gives rise to different response of the electric polarization, whose susceptibility is suppressed in H-type like case compared with that of R-type like one. Further analysis shows the dielectric response to perpendicular electric field is linked to the moire ferroelectric dipole texture. Their underlying link comes from that, through Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, the external electric field tends to change the internal pseudo-spin texture, which further depends on the twist induced dipole texture. Consequently, the suppression of dielectric response can be attributed to the topology protection of such ferroelectric dipole structure.</description>

      <title>Con-CDVAE: A method for the conditional generation of crystal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, progress has been made in generating new crystalline materials using generative machine learning models, though gaps remain in efficiently generating crystals based on target properties. This paper proposes the Con-CDVAE model, an extension of the Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE), for conditional crystal generation. We introduce innovative components, design a two-step training method, and develop three unique generation strategies to enhance model performance. The effectiveness of Con-CDVAE is demonstrated through extensive testing under various conditions, including both single and combined property targets. Ablation studies further underscore the critical role of the new components in achieving our model's performance. Additionally, we validate the physical credibility of the generated crystals through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, confirming Con-CDVAE's potential in material science research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of the marcasite-type compounds MSb$_2$ (M = Ta, Nb) in the temperature range of 310-730 K. These compounds were synthesized by a solid-state reaction followed by the spark plasma sintering process. The Rietveld refinement method confirms the monoclinic phase with space group C2/m for both compounds. The observed values of Seebeck coefficients exhibit non-monotonic behaviour in the studied temperature range, with the maximum magnitude of -14.4 and -22.7 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ for TaSb$_2$ and NbSb$_2$, respectively at ~444 K. The negative sign of S in the full temperature window signifies the n-type behaviour of these compounds. Both electrical and thermal conductivities show an increasing trend with temperature. The experimentally observed thermoelectric properties are understood through the first-principles DFT and Boltzmann transport equation. A pseudogap in the density of states around the Fermi level characterizes the semimetallic behaviour of these compounds. The multi-band electron and hole pockets were found to be mainly responsible for the temperature dependence of transport properties. The experimental power factors are found to be ~0.09 and ~0.42 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ at 310 K for TaSb2 and NbSb2, respectively. From the DFT-based calculations, the maximum possible power factors for p-type conduction are predicted as ~1.14 and ~1.74 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$, while these values are found to be ~1.16 and ~1.80 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for n-type TaSb$_2$ and NbSb$_2$, respectively at 300 K with the corresponding doping concentrations. The present study suggests that the combined DFT and Boltzmann transport theory are found to be reasonably good at explaining the experimental transport properties, and moderate power factors are predicted.</description>

      <title>NSGAN: A Non-Dominant Sorting Optimisation-Based Generative Adversarial Design Framework for Alloy Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12495</link>

Abstract: The design and discovery of new materials is fundamental to advancing scientific and technological innovation. The recent emergence of the materials genome concept holds great promise in revolutionising materials science by enabling the systematic utilisation of data for efficient prediction and optimisation of superior materials. However, the materials genome approach can be stymied by the vast complexity of design spaces, which often demand substantial computational resources and sophisticated data processing capabilities. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel generative design framework called the non-dominant sorting optimisation-based generative adversarial networks (NSGAN). Capitalising on the synergies of genetic algorithms (GA) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), NSGAN provides a robust and efficient approach for tackling high-dimensional multi-objective optimisation design problems. To validate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we applied the model to a comprehensive dataset of aluminium alloys. Additionally, an online tool was created as a supplementary resource, offering a brief introduction to this innovative method for the wider scientific community. This study explores the potential of a predictive and data-driven approach in material design, indicating a promising pathway for widespread applications in the field of materials science.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale brittle-to-ductile transition of the C15 CaAl$_2$ Laves phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of temperature on the deformation behaviour of the C15 CaAl$_2$ Laves phase, a key constituent for enhancing the mechanical properties of Mg alloys up to service temperatures of 200 {\deg}C, remains largely unexplored. This study presents, for the first time, the nanoscale brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) of this intermetallic phase through in situ testing including nanoindentation, scratch testing, and micropillar splitting conducted at elevated temperatures. By correlating observations from these techniques, changes in deformation of CaAl$_2$ were identified in relation to temperature. High-temperature nanoindentation quantitatively determined the temperature range for the BDT, and revealed that CaAl$_2$ undergoes a BDT at ~0.55T$_m$, exhibiting an intermediate region of microplasticity. A noticeable decrease in nanoindentation hardness was observed at ~450-500 {\deg}C, accompanied by an increase in residual indent size, while indentation cracking was not observed above 300 {\deg}C. Results from high-temperature micropillar splitting revealed cracking and brittle pillar splitting up to 300 {\deg}C, with an increase in apparent fracture toughness from 0.9 $\pm$ 0.1 MPa$\cdot\sqrt m$ to 2.8 $\pm$ 0.3 MPa$\cdot\sqrt m$, and subsequent crack-free plastic deformation from 400 {\deg}C. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the deformed material from nanoindentation revealed that the BDT of CaAl$_2$ may be attributed to enhanced dislocation plasticity with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>PH-NODE: A DFPT and finite displacement supercell based python code for searching nodes in topological phononic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the topological physics of phonons is fundamentally important for understanding various practical applications. Here, we present a density-functional perturbation theory and finite displacement supercell based Python 3 software package called PH-NODE for efficiently computing phonon nodes present in real material through a first-principle approach. The present version of the code is interfaced with the WIEN2k, Elk, and ABINIT packages. In order to benchmark the code, four different types of materials are considered, which include (i) FeSi, a well-known double-Weyl point; (ii) LiCaAs, a half-Heusler single-type-I Weyl topological phonon (TP); and (iii) ScZn, coexisting nodal-line and nodal-ring TPs; (iv) TiS, six pairs of bulk Weyl nodes. In FeSi, the node points are found at ${\Gamma}$(0, 0, 0) and R(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) high symmetric points. Also, there are 21 energy values at which the node points are situated, corresponding to the full Brillouin Zone. For LiCaAs, the previously reported literature claims that there is a node point along the W-X high symmetry direction between the highest longitudinal acoustic and the lowest transverse optical branch, while in our DFT calculations, a gap of 0.17 meV is found. Furthermore, ScZn hosts six nodal-ring TPs phonons at the boundary planes of the Brillouin Zone in the vicinity of the M high-symmetric point. In addition to this, straight-line TPs are also found along the ${\Gamma}$-X and ${\Gamma}$-R high symmetric directions. Moreover, for TiS, six weyl node points (WP1, WP2, WP3, WP4, WP5 and WP6) are found along H-K high-symmetric direction. The results obtained from the PH-NODE code are in good agreement with the experimentally and theoretically reported data for each material.</description>

      <title>Zeolite Adsorption Property Prediction using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently predict adsorption properties of zeolites can be of large benefit in accelerating the design process of novel materials. The existing configuration space for these materials is wide, while existing molecular simulation methods are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a model which is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude faster at adsorption properties compared to molecular simulations. To validate the model, we generated datasets containing various aluminium configurations for the MOR, MFI, RHO and ITW zeolites along with their heat of adsorptions and Henry coefficients for CO$_2$, obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The predictions obtained from the Machine Learning model are in agreement with the values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations, confirming that the model can be used for property prediction. Furthermore, we show that the model can be used for identifying adsorption sites. Finally, we evaluate the capability of our model for generating novel zeolite configurations by using it in combination with a genetic algorithm.</description>

      <title>Giant electrode effect on tunneling magnetoresistance and electroresistance in van der Waals intrinsic multiferroic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) with multiple nonvolatile resistive states are highly suitable for new physics and next-generation storage electronics. However, currently reported vdW-MFTJs are based on two types of materials, i.e., vdW ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials, forming a multiferroic system. This undoubtedly introduces additional interfaces, increasing the complexity of experimental preparation. Herein, we engineer vdW intrinsic MFTJs utilizing bilayer VS$_2$. By employing the nonequilibrium Green's function combined with density functional theory, we systematically investigate the influence of three types of electrodes (including non-vdW pure metal Ag/Au, vdW metallic 1T-MoS$_2$/2H-PtTe$_2$, and vdW ferromagnetic metallic Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$) on the electronic transport properties of VS$_2$-based intrinsic MFTJs. We demonstrate that these MFTJs manifest a giant electrode-dependent electronic transport characteristic effect. Comprehensively comparing these electrode pairs, the Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ electrode combination exhibits optimal transport properties, the maximum TMR (TER) can reach 10949\% (69\%) and the minimum resistance-area product (RA) is 0.45 $\Omega$$\mu$m$^{2}$, as well as the perfect spin filtering and negative differential resistance effects. More intriguingly, TMR (TER) can be further enhanced to 34000\% (380\%) by applying an external bias voltage (0.1 V), while RA can be reduced to 0.16 $\Omega$$\mu$m$^{2}$ under the influence of biaxial stress (-3\%). Our proposed concept of designing vdW-MFTJs using intrinsic multiferroic materials points towards new avenues in experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Observation of the anomalous Nernst effect in altermagnetic candidate Mn5Si3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect generates transverse voltage to the applied thermal gradient in magnetically ordered systems. The effect was previously considered excluded in compensated magnetic materials with collinear ordering. However, in the recently identified class of compensated magnetic materials, dubbed altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking in the electronic band structure makes the presence of the anomalous Nernst effect possible despite the collinear spin arrangement. In this work, we investigate epitaxial Mn5Si3 thin films known to be an altermagnetic candidate. We show that the material manifests a sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient despite the small net magnetization of the films. The measured magnitudes of the anomalous Nernst coefficient reach a scale of microVolts per Kelvin. We support our magneto-thermoelectric measurements by density-functional theory calculations of the material's spin-split electronic structure, which allows for the finite Berry curvature in the reciprocal space. Furthermore, we present our calculations of the intrinsic Berry-curvature Nernst conductivity, which agree with our experimental observations.</description>

      <title>The effect of niobium thin film structure on losses in superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting microwave circuits is strongly influenced by the material properties of the superconducting film and substrate. While progress has been made in understanding the importance of surface preparation and the effect of surface oxides, the complex effect of superconductor film structure on microwave losses is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigate the microwave properties of niobium resonators with different crystalline properties and related surface topographies. We analyze a series of magnetron sputtered films in which the Nb crystal orientation and surface topography are changed by varying the substrate temperatures between room temperature and 975 K. The lowest-loss resonators that we measure have quality factors of over one million at single-photon powers, among the best ever recorded using the Nb on sapphire platform. We observe the highest quality factors in films grown at an intermediate temperature regime of the growth series (550 K) where the films display both preferential ordering of the crystal domains and low surface roughness. Furthermore, we analyze the temperature-dependent behavior of our resonators to learn about how the quasiparticle density in the Nb film is affected by the niobium crystal structure and the presence of grain boundaries. Our results stress the connection between the crystal structure of superconducting films and the loss mechanisms suffered by the resonators and demonstrate that even a moderate change in temperature during thin film deposition can significantly affect the resulting quality factors.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dirac feature in the Metallated Carbyne as a Potential Platform for Exploring Widely Separated Majorana Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of next-generation quantum computing devices is hindered by the formidable challenge of detecting and manipulating Majorana Fermion in nanomaterials. In this study, we explore a new approach of detecting Majorana Fermion in a metallated carbyne nanowire array. Through comprehensive optimizations, we successfully achieved a local magnetic moment exceeding 3{\mu}B, with the average magnetic moment of the entire metallated carbyne surpassing 1{\mu}B. Surprisingly, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the ferromagnetic Ru metallated carbyne, when coupled with a superconducting Ru substrate, is already able to demonstrate the symmetric opening of a Dirac gap at the gamma point. We discovered that the kink structure of the metallated carbyne plays a crucial role in modulating its topological properties. Moreover, we identified the origin of magnetic hybridization which is intricately linked to the distinctive features found in one-dimensional carbon structures. Our findings not only uncover the unconventional ferromagnetism observed in metallated carbyne but also present an exciting opportunity to realize carbon-based materials capable of hosting Majorana Zero Modes (MZM). This discovery has the potential to further stabilize MZM by decoupling the orbital perturbation from the MZM itself.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent generation in solids via linearly polarized laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To add to the rapidly progressing field of ultrafast photocurrent, we propose a universal method to generate photocurrent in normal and topological materials using a pair of multicycle linearly polarized laser pulses. The interplay of the fundamental and its second harmonic pulses is studied for the generation of photocurrent in Weyl semimetals by varying the angle between the polarization direction, relative intensity, and relative phase delay. It has been found that the presence of a comparatively weaker second harmonic pulse is sufficient to generate substantial photocurrent. Moreover, significant photocurrent is generated even when polarization directions are orthogonal for certain ratios of the lasers' intensities. In addition, the photocurrent is found to be susceptible to the delay between the two pulses. We have illustrated that all our findings are extendable to non-topological and two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies in dynamic yield stress measurements of cement pastes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic yield stress associated with the flow cessation of cement pastes is measured using a rheometer equipped with various shear geometries such as vane, helical, sandblasted co-axial cylinders, and serrated parallel plates, as well as with the mini-cone spread test. Discrepancies in yield stress values are observed for cement pastes at various volume fractions, with one to two orders of magnitude difference between vane, helical and mini-cone spread measurements on the one hand, and co-axial cylinder and parallel plate measurements on the other hand. To understand this discrepancy, the flow profile of a cement paste in the parallel-plate geometry is investigated with a high-speed camera, revealing the rapid formation of an un-sheared band near the static bottom plate. The width of this band depends upon the rotational velocity of the top plate, and upon the shear time. Recalculation of shear stress shows that the reduced sheared gap alone cannot explain the low measured yield stress. Further exploration suggests the formation of zones with lower particle content, possibly linked to cement particle sedimentation. Here, we argue that the complex nature of cement pastes, composed of negatively buoyant non-Brownian particles with attractive interactions due to highly charged nano-size hydration products, accounts for their complex rheological behavior.</description>

      <title>Diffusion, viscosity and linear rheology of valence-limited disordered fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the dynamics and linear rheology of disordered systems made of patchy particles, focussing on the role of valence, temperature and bonding mechanism. We demonstrate that the dynamics is enslaved to bonding, giving rise to an activated behaviour at low temperature. By independently computing the diffusion constant and the viscosity from the simulations, we also confirm the validity of the Stokes-Einstein relation in valence-limited systems, with two caveats: (i) the diffusion constant requires a finite-size correction, at least at the intermediate density we investigate, and (ii) there is the onset of a breakdown that appears at the lowest temperatures considered. Finally, our results show that the storage and loss moduli of mixtures of divalent and $M$-valent particles exhibit an apparent power-law dependence on frequency, hinting at the possibility of using the composition to finely tune the rheological response of these materials. Our results compare well with literature experimental data on valence-limited DNA nanostars. In addition, the wealth of data we present and analyse here will help to develop and test theoretical frameworks aimed at describing the dynamics of flexible limited-valence particles that self-assemble into disordered networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling stands as a pivotal determinant in the realm of condensed matter physics. In recent, its profound influence on spin dynamics opens up a captivating arena with promising applications. Notably, the topological insulator-ferromagnet heterostructure has been recognized for inducing spin dynamics through applied current, driven by spin-orbit torque. Building upon recent observations revealing spin flip signals within this heterostructure, our study elucidates the conditions governing spin flips by studying the magnetization dynamics. We establish that the interplay between spin-anisotropy and spin-orbit torque plays a crucial role in shaping the physics of magnetization dynamics within the heterostructure. Furthermore, we categorize various modes of magnetization dynamics, constructing a comprehensive phase diagram across distinct energy scales, damping constants, and applied frequencies. This research not only offers insights into controlling spin direction but also charts a new pathway to the practical application of spin-orbit coupled systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a simple detection scheme to study spin waves excited by surface acoustic wave (SAW) in ferromagnetic thin films. Metallic antennas made of Ta and a ferromagnetic element are placed along the SAW propagation path. The SAW excites spin waves in the ferromagnetic element and induces acoustoelectric current in the antennas, which are detected as a DC voltage. The DC voltage takes an extremum at the spin wave resonance condition, which demonstrates that the antenna acts as a non-local spin wave detector. The antennas placed before and after the ferromagnetic element along the SAW propagation path can probe spin wave excitation from reflected and transmitted SAWs, respectively. Interestingly, we find characteristics of spin wave excitations that are different for the reflected and transmitted SAWs: the former excites spin waves with larger frequency with broader linewidth compared to the latter. The results show that the antennas act as a non-local spin wave power detector and can be used to map out the spin wave spectra in a unique way, providing insights into the magnon-phonon coupling in magnetic nanostructures fabricated on phononic SAW devices.</description>

      <title>Higher Derivative Muffin Tin Orbitals (HDMTO) and Higher Derivative Koringa Khon and Rostoker (HDKKR) methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a Linearized version of the Koringa Khon and Rostoker method (LKKR) and show it to be equivalent to the Linearized Muffin Tin Orbitals method (LMTO). We then present higher derivative versions of both methods, e.g. HDKKR and HDMTO and show them to be partially distinct (not equivalent). In particular HDKKR basis set does not have an equivalent ground state for the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian as the HDKKR basis set and has greater variational power than the HDMTO one. Because the KS method, for Density Functional Theory (DFT), is variational HDKKR will give better ground state energies than HDMTO. However HDKKR is much harder to work with then HDMTO requiring much greater computer resources so HDMTO can often be preferred.</description>

Abstract: Like air flowing over a wing, optimizing the flow of electronic charge is essential to the operation of nanoscale devices. Unfortunately, the delicate interplay of charge, spin, and heat in complex devices has precluded detailed imaging of charge flow. Here, we report on the visualization of intrinsic charge current streamlines through yttrium iron garnet micromagnetic heterostructures. Scanning photovoltage microscopy of precisely designed devices leads to striking spatial patterns, with prominent photovoltage features emerging in corners and narrow constrictions. These patterns, which evolve continuously with rotation of an external magnetic field, enable rich spatial mapping of fluid-like flow. Taking inspiration from aerodynamic Clark Y airfoils, we engineer micromagnetic wing shaped devices, called electrofoils, which allow us to precisely contort, compress and decompress flowlines of electronic charge.120 (39) e2221815120</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Corner State Arrays in Photonic Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the studies of topological corner states (TCSs) are extended from crystals to quasicrystals, which are referred to as higher-order topological quasicrystalline insulators (HOTQIs). However, the TCSs of complete quasi-periodic structure in photonic systems have yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, there is only one TCS in each corner region in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). Increasing the number of TCS is expected to increase application potential of TCSs. In this work, HOTQIs in photonic systems are experimentally observed. It is found that HOTQIs possess TCS arrays, and each TCS array contains several TCSs. Furthermore, the universal theoretical framework of the multimer analysis method is improved, and the difference in the average charge density is proposed as a real-space topological index. These results will open up new ideas for investigating highly integrated, multi-region localized TCSs and are expected to provide new ways to explore topological phenomena and the applications of photonic quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>An experimental high-throughput to high-fidelity study towards discovering Al-Cr containing corrosion-resistant compositionally complex alloys</title>

Abstract: Compositionally complex alloys hold the promise of simultaneously attaining superior combinations of properties, such as corrosion resistance, light-weighting, and strength. Achieving this goal is a challenge due in part to a large number of possible compositions and structures in the vast alloy design space. High-throughput methods offer a path forward, but a strong connection between the synthesis of an alloy of a given composition and structure with its properties has not been fully realized to date. Here, we present the rapid identification of corrosion-resistant alloys based on combinations of Al and Cr in a base Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni alloy. Previously unstudied alloy stoichiometries were identified using a combination of high-throughput experimental screening coupled with key metallurgical and electrochemical corrosion tests, identifying alloys with excellent passivation behavior. The alloy native oxide performance and its self-healing attributes were probed using rapid tests in deaerated 0.1 mol/L H2SO4. Importantly, a correlation was found between the electrochemical impedance modulus of the exposure-modified air-formed film and self-healing rate of the CCAs. Multi-element extended x-ray absorption fine structure analyses connected more ordered type chemical short-range order in the Ni-Al 1st nearest-neighbor shell to poorer corrosion resistance. This report underscores the utility of high throughput exploration of compositionally complex alloys for the identification and rapid screening of a vast stoichiometric space.</description>

      <title>Active learning for effective Hamiltonian of super-large-scale atomic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian is widely used to predict and simulate the properties of ferroelectrics and relaxor ferroelectrics. However, the parametrization method of the effective Hamiltonian is complicated and hardly can resolve the systems with complex interactions and/or complex components. Here, we developed an on-the-fly active machine learning approach to parametrize the effective Hamiltonian based on Bayesian linear regression. The parametrization is completed in molecular dynamics simulations, with the energy, forces and stress predicted at each step along with their uncertainties. First-principles calculations are executed when the uncertainties are large to retrain the parameters. This approach provides a universal and automatic way to compute the effective Hamiltonian parameters for any considered systems including complex systems which previous methods can not handle. The form of the effective Hamiltonian is also revised to include some complex terms. BaTiO3, CsPbI3 and SrTiO3/PbTiO3 surface are taken as examples to show the accurateness of this approach comparing with conventional first-principles parametrization method.</description>

      <title>Electron-induced non-monotonic pressure dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity of {\theta}-TaN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental research suggests that $\theta$-TaN is a semimetal with high thermal conductivity ($\kappa$), primarily due to the contribution of phonons ($\kappa_\texttt{ph}$). By using first-principles calculations, we show a non-monotonic pressure dependence of the $\kappa$ of $\theta$-TaN. $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ first increases until it reaches a maximum at around 60~GPa, and then decreases. This anomalous behaviour is a consequence of the competing pressure responses of phonon-phonon and phonon-electron interactions, in contrast to the known materials BAs and BP, where the non-monotonic pressure dependence is caused by the interplay between different phonon-phonon scattering channels. Although TaN has phonon dispersion features similar to BAs at ambient pressure, its response to pressure is different and an overall stiffening of the phonon branches takes place. Consequently, the relevant phonon-phonon scattering weakens as pressure increases. However, the increased electronic density of states near the Fermi level, and specifically the emergence of additional pockets of the Fermi surface at the high-symmetry L point in the Brillouin zone, leads to a substantial increase in phonon-electron scattering at high pressures, driving a decrease in $\kappa_{\mathrm{ph}}$. At intermediate pressures ($\sim$~20$-$70~GPa), the $\kappa$ of TaN surpasses that of BAs. Our work provides deeper insight into phonon transport in semimetals and metals where phonon-electron scattering is relevant.</description>

Abstract: Finding tunable van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets that operate at above room temperature is an important research focus in physics and materials science. Most vdW magnets are only intrinsically magnetic far below room temperature and magnetism with square-shaped hysteresis at room-temperature has yet to be observed. Here, we report magnetism in a quasi-2D magnet Cr1.2Te2 observed at room temperature (290 K). This magnetism was tuned via a protonic gate with an electron doping concentration up to 3.8 * 10^21 cm^-3. We observed non-monotonic evolutions in both coercivity and anomalous Hall resistivity. Under increased electron doping, the coercivities and anomalous Hall effects (AHEs) vanished, indicating a doping-induced magnetic phase transition. This occurred up to room temperature. DFT calculations showed the formation of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase caused by the intercalation of protons which induced significant electron doping in the Cr1.2Te2. The tunability of the magnetic properties and phase in room temperature magnetic vdW Cr1.2Te2 is a significant step towards practical spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Giant Modulation of Refractive Index from Picoscale Atomic Displacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural disorder has been shown to enhance and modulate magnetic, electrical, dipolar, electrochemical, and mechanical properties of materials. However, the possibility of obtaining novel optical and optoelectronic properties from structural disorder remains an open question. Here, we show unambiguous evidence of disorder in the form of anisotropic, picoscale atomic displacements modulating the refractive index tensor and resulting in the giant optical anisotropy observed in BaTiS$_3$, a quasi-one-dimensional hexagonal chalcogenide. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal the presence of antipolar displacements of Ti atoms within adjacent TiS$_6$ chains along the c-axis, and three-fold degenerate Ti displacements in the a-b plane. $^{47/49}$Ti solid-state NMR provides additional evidence for those Ti displacements in the form of a three-horned NMR lineshape resulting from a low symmetry local environment around Ti atoms. We used scanning transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the globally disordered Ti a-b plane displacements and find them to be ordered locally over a few unit cells. First-principles calculations show that the Ti a-b plane displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab-plane, while having minimal impact on the refractive index along the chain direction, thus resulting in a giant enhancement in the optical anisotropy. By showing a strong connection between structural disorder with picoscale displacements and the optical response in BaTiS$_3$, this study opens a pathway for designing optical materials with high refractive index and functionalities such as large optical anisotropy and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Crystal Growth Characterization of WSe$_2$ Thin Film Using Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Materials characterization remains a labor-intensive process, with a large amount of expert time required to post-process and analyze micrographs. As a result, machine learning has become an essential tool in materials science, including for materials characterization. In this study, we perform an in-depth analysis of the prediction of crystal coverage in WSe$_2$ thin film atomic force microscopy (AFM) height maps with supervised regression and segmentation models. Regression models were trained from scratch and through transfer learning from a ResNet pretrained on ImageNet and MicroNet to predict monolayer crystal coverage. Models trained from scratch outperformed those using features extracted from pretrained models, but fine-tuning yielded the best performance, with an impressive 0.99 $R^2$ value on a diverse set of held-out test micrographs. Notably, features extracted from MicroNet showed significantly better performance than those from ImageNet, but fine-tuning on ImageNet demonstrated the reverse. As the problem is natively a segmentation task, the segmentation models excelled in determining crystal coverage on image patches. However, when applied to full images rather than patches, the performance of segmentation models degraded considerably, while the regressors did not, suggesting that regression models may be more robust to scale and dimension changes compared to segmentation models. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of computer vision models for automating sample characterization in 2D materials while providing important practical considerations for their use in the development of chalcogenide thin films.</description>

Abstract: Ion exchange processes between an ions reservoir and a solid matrix are modeled under the assumption that near interface volumes achieve equilibrium in a much faster time than the overall process time, while in the bulk of the solid matrix, ions are transported by an interdiffusion kinetic process. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are established within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in terms of the chemical potential of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems. This result is fundamental to allow the development of the equilibrium theory for the evaluation of near-surface equilibrium concentrations and ion exchange isotherms. Interaction energies of the exchanging components within the subsystems matrices can be further determined. The kinetics of the ion exchange process in silicate glass is further discussed to find connections with the near-surface equilibrium condition. Within the framework of the proposed model, interdiffusion equations can be derived from having the boundary condition established by the thermodynamic equilibrium at the near interface. It has been found that the thermodynamic factor of the interdiffusion coefficient is related to the interaction energy of the exchanging ions in the glass allowing a new approach to the interpretation of past experimental results.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of GlassNet for physics-informed machine learning of glass stability and glass-forming ability</title>

Abstract: Glasses form the basis of many modern applications and also hold great potential for future medical and environmental applications. However, their structural complexity and large composition space make design and optimization challenging for certain applications. Of particular importance for glass processing is an estimate of a given composition's glass-forming ability (GFA). However, there remain many open questions regarding the physical mechanisms of glass formation, especially in oxide glasses. It is apparent that a proxy for GFA would be highly useful in glass processing and design, but identifying such a surrogate property has proven itself to be difficult. Here, we explore the application of an open-source pre-trained NN model, GlassNet, that can predict the characteristic temperatures necessary to compute glass stability (GS) and assess the feasibility of using these physics-informed ML (PIML)-predicted GS parameters to estimate GFA. In doing so, we track the uncertainties at each step of the computation - from the original ML prediction errors, to the compounding of errors during GS estimation, and finally to the final estimation of GFA. While GlassNet exhibits reasonable accuracy on all individual properties, we observe a large compounding of error in the combination of these individual predictions for the prediction of GS, finding that random forest models offer similar accuracy to GlassNet. We also breakdown the ML performance on different glass families and find that the error in GS prediction is correlated with the error in crystallization peak temperature prediction. Lastly, we utilize this finding to assess the relationship between top-performing GS parameters and GFA for two ternary glass systems: sodium borosilicate and sodium iron phosphate glasses. We conclude that to obtain true ML predictive capability of GFA, significantly more data needs to be collected.</description>

      <title>Cubic magneto-optic Kerr effect in Ni(111) thin films with and without twinning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In most studies utilizing the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), the detected change of polarized light upon reflection from a magnetized sample is supposed to be proportional to the magnetization $\boldsymbol{M}$. However, MOKE signatures quadratic in $\boldsymbol{M}$ have also been identified and utilized, e.g., to sense the structural order in Heusler compounds, to detect spin-orbit torques or to image antiferromagnetic domains. In our study, we observe a strong anisotropic MOKE contribution of third order in $\boldsymbol{M}$ in Ni(111) thin films, attributed to a cubic magneto-optic tensor $\propto $ $\boldsymbol{M}^3$. We further show that the angular dependence of cubic MOKE (CMOKE) is affected by the amount of structural domain twinning in the sample. Our detailed study on CMOKE for two selected photon energies will open up new opportunities for CMOKE applications with sensitivity to twinning properties of thin films, e.g. CMOKE spectroscopy and microscopy or time-resolved CMOKE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field method including Coulomb repulsion $U$, $V$ and spin-orbital coupling $\lambda$ self-consistently to investigate the mechanism of structural instability and magnetic ordering in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$. A comprehensive quadrupole phase diagram versus $U$ and $V$ with $\lambda$=0.28eV is calculated. Our results demonstrate that the easy-plane anisotropy and the intersite Coulomb repulsion $V$ must be considered to remove the orbital frustration. The increasing of $V$ to $&gt;$20meV would arrange quadrupole $Q_{x^2-y^2}$ antiparallelly, accompanied with small parallel $Q_{3z^2-r^2}$, and stabilize Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ into the body-centered tetragonal structure. Such antiparallel $Q_{x^2-y^2}$ provides a new mechanism of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and gives rise to the canted antiferromagnetic (CAF) state along [110] axis. Moreover, sizable octupoles such as $O_{21}^{31}$, $O_{21}^{33}$, $O_{21}^{34}$ and $O_{21}^{36}$ are discovered for the first time in CAF state. Our study not only provides a comprehensive understanding of the experiment results in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$, but also reveals some commonalities of 5d compounds.</description>

Abstract: The identification of distinct charge transport features, deriving from nontrivial bulk band and surface states, has been a challenging subject in the field of topological systems. In topological Dirac and Weyl semimetals, nontrivial conical bands with Fermi-arc surface states give rise to negative longitudinal magnetoresistance due to chiral anomaly effect and unusual thickness dependent quantum oscillation from Weyl-orbit effect, which were demonstrated recently in experiments. In this work, we report the experimental observations of large nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport effects for both longitudinal and transverse channels in an untwinned Weyl metal of SrRuO$_3$ thin film grown on a SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate. From rigorous measurements with bias current applied along various directions with respect to the crystalline principal axes, the magnitude of nonlinear Hall signals from the transverse channel exhibits a simple sin$\alpha$ dependence at low temperatures, where $\alpha$ is the angle between bias current direction and orthorhombic [001]$_{\rm o}$, reaching a maximum when current is along orthorhombic [1-10]$_{\rm o}$. On the contrary, the magnitude of nonlinear and nonreciprocal signals in the longitudinal channel attains a maximum for bias current along [001]$_{\rm o}$, and it vanishes for bias current along [1-10]$_{\rm o}$. The observed $\alpha$-dependent nonlinear and nonreciprocal signals in longitudinal and transverse channels reveal a magnetic Weyl phase with an effective Berry curvature dipole along [1-10]$_{\rm o}$ from surface states, accompanied by 1D chiral edge modes along [001]$_{\rm o}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transition of Organic Spin Liquid Tuned by Mixing Counterions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We found a plateau in the magnitude of the isolated magnetic moments as a function of the anisotropy of the transfer integral (t'/t) in the gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase of an S=1/2 triangular lattice molecular solid X[Pd(dmit)2]2 (dmit = 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate), accomplished by a fine-tuning of t'/t through the mixing of cations, X. In contrast, the magnetic susceptibility at the lowest temperature in the QSL phase parametrized by t'/t evinces an unconventional suppression approaching the quantum phase transition, implying significant critical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The $GW$ Approximation: A Quantum Chemistry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an in-depth examination of the $GW$ approximation of Green's function many-body perturbation theory by detailing both its theoretical and practical aspects in the realm of quantum chemistry. First, the quasiparticle context is introduced before delving into the derivation of Hedin's equations. From these, we explain how to derive the well-known $GW$ approximation of the self-energy. In a second time, we meticulously explain each step involved in a $GW$ calculation and what type of physical quantities can be computed. To illustrate its versatility, we consider two contrasting systems: the water molecule, a weakly correlated system, and the carbon dimer, a strongly correlated system. Each stage of the process is thoroughly detailed and explained alongside numerical results and illustrative plots. We hope that the contribution will facilitate the dissemination and democratization of Green's function-based formalisms within the computational and theoretical quantum chemistry community.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams and polarization reversal in nanosized Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To describe the polar properties of the nanosized HfxZr1-xO2-y, we evolve the "effective" Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) model based on the parametrization of the Landau expansion coefficients for the polar and antipolar orderings. We have shown that the effective LGD model can predict the influence of screening conditions and size effects on phase diagrams, polarization reversal and structural properties of the nanosized HfxZr1-xO2-y of various shape and sizes. To verify the model, we use available experimental results for HfxZr1-xO2 thin films and oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles prepared at different annealing conditions. X-ray diffraction, which was used to determine the phase composition of the HfO2-y nanoparticles, revealed the formation of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase in them. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to explore the correlation of lattice dynamics and structural changes appearing in dependence on the oxygen vacancies concentration in the HfO2-y nanoparticles. Since our approach allows to determine the conditions (shape, sizes, Zr content and/or oxygen vacancies amount) for which the nanosized HfxZr1-xO2-y are ferroelectrics or antiferroelectrics, we hope that obtained results are useful for creation of next generation of Si-compatible ferroelectric gate oxide nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Highly stable photoluminescence in vacuum-processed halide perovskite core-shell 1D nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid organometal halide perovskites (HP) present exceptional optoelectronic properties, but their poor long-term stability is a major bottleneck for their commercialization. Herein, we present a solvent-free approach to growing single-crystal organic nanowires (ONW), nanoporous metal oxide scaffolds, and HP to form a core@multishell architecture. The synthetic procedure is carried out under mild vacuum conditions employing thermal evaporation for the metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) nanowires, which will be the core, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) for the TiO2 shell, and co-evaporation of lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I / MAI) for the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3 / MAPI) perovskite shell. We present a detailed characterization of the nanostructures by (S)-TEM and XRD, revealing a different crystallization of the hybrid perovskite depending on the template: while the growth on H2Pc nanowires induces the typical tetragonal structure of the MAPI perovskite, a low-dimensional phase (LDP) was observed on the one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes. Such a combination yields an unprecedentedly stable photoluminescence emission over 20 hours and over 300 hours after encapsulation in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under different atmospheres including N2, air, and high moisture levels. In addition, the unique one-dimensional morphology of the system, together with the high refractive index HP, allows for a strong waveguiding effect along the nanowire length.</description>
