      <title>Hot-carrier photocatalysts with energy-selective contacts based on quantum wells and dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we simulate the function of hot-carrier photocatalysts (HCPCs) with quantum well and quantum dot energy-selective contacts (ESCs) in the water-splitting reaction. The transport equations for these ESCs are derived by using ballistic transport theory. The results indicate that thermalization loss from non-ideal ESCs is a primary factor diminishing the efficiency of HCPCs. The performance of HCPCs can be enhanced by optimizing the position of ESCs and the width of the extraction energy. Notably, HCPCs with quantum dot ESCs demonstrate superior performance compared to those with quantum well ESCs.</description>

      <title>All-electric mimicking synaptic plasticity based on the noncollinear antiferromagnetic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, which seeks to replicate the brain's ability to process information, has garnered significant attention due to its potential to achieve brain-like computing efficiency and human cognitive intelligence. Spin-orbit torque (SOT) devices can be used to simulate artificial synapses with non-volatile, high-speed processing and endurance characteristics. Nevertheless, achieving energy-efficient all-electric synaptic plasticity emulation using SOT devices remains a challenge. We chose the noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn3Pt as spin source to fabricate the Mn3Pt-based SOT device, leveraging its unconventional spin current resulting from magnetic space breaking. By adjusting the amplitude, duration, and number of pulsed currents, the Mn3Pt-based SOT device achieves nonvolatile multi-state modulated by all-electric SOT switching, enabling emulate synaptic behaviors like excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), long-term depression (LTD) and the long-term potentiation (LTP) process. In addition, we show the successful training of an artificial neural network based on such SOT device in recognizing handwritten digits with a high recognition accuracy of 94.95 %, which is only slightly lower than that from simulations (98.04 %). These findings suggest that the Mn3Pt-based SOT device is a promising candidate for the implementation of memristor-based brain-inspired computing systems.</description>

      <title>Field-free current-induced magnetization switching of a room temperature van der Waals magnet for neuromorphic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin orbit torque (SOT) has become a promising approach to efficiently manipulate the magnetization switching in spintronic devices. As a main factor to impact the device performance, the high quality interface is essentially desired, which can be readily acquired by using the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials. Recently, a 2D ferromagnetic material Fe3GaTe2 has been discovered to possess the above-room-temperature Curie temperature and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), providing an excellent candidate to build spintronic devices. On the other hand, an external magnetic field is necessary for the SOT-driven deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization, which has become a block for the real applications. Here, we realize the field-free SOT switching of Fe3GaTe2 at room temperature based on the Fe3GaTe2/MnPt heterostructure. In addition, inspired by the superiority of 2D materials in 3D heterogeneous integration, we explore the potential of our device in the computing in memory (CIM). With the application of the current pulses, the gradual switching of our device at zero field imitates the function of artificial synapse in the convolutional neural network (CNN), achieving a high accuracy (~92.8%) pattern recognition. Our work proposes a feasible solution for field-free SOT switching in 2D vdW spintronic devices, which paves the way for applications in magnetic memory and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric electron distribution induced intrinsically strong anisotropy of thermal transport in bulk CrOCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic heat transfer offers promising solutions to the efficient heat dissipation in the realm of electronic device thermal management. However, the fundamental origin of the anisotropy of thermal transport remains mysterious. In this paper, by combining frequency domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) technique and first-principles-based multiscale simulations, we report the intrinsic anisotropy of thermal transport in bulk CrOCl, and further trace the origin of the anisotropy back to the fundamental electronic structures. The in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) at 300 K are found to be 21.6 and 2.18 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, respectively, showcasing a strong $\kappa_\mathrm{in-plane}/\kappa_\mathrm{cross-plane}$ ratio of $\sim$10. Deep analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structures reveals that electrons are mainly distributed along the in-plane direction with limited interlayer distribution along the cross-plane direction, fundamentally leading to the intrinsic anisotropy of thermal transport in bulk CrOCl. The insight gained in this work sheds light on the design of advanced thermal functional materials.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency, cryogenic-compatible grating couplers on an AlN-on-sapphire platform through bottom-side coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sapphire is a commonly used substrate for wide-bandgap III-nitride photonic materials. However, its relatively high refractive index results in low transmission efficiency in grating couplers. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the transmission efficiency can be significantly enhanced by bottom-side coupling. A metal reflector is deposited on the top side of the chip, and the fiber array is glued to the bottom side of the substrate. We experimentally achieve a transmission efficiency as high as 42% per coupler on an aluminum nitride (AlN) on sapphire platform at the telecom wavelength. In addition, the grating couplers show a robust performance at a cryogenic temperature as low as 3~K for both transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes. Our results can be useful to a wide range of sapphire-based applications that require low coupling loss and cryogenic operation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Coherent Dynamics of Microring Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation computing clusters require ultra-high-bandwidth optical interconnects to support large-scale artificial-intelligence applications. In this context, microring modulators (MRMs) emerge as a promising solution. Nevertheless, their potential is curtailed by inherent challenges, such as pronounced frequency chirp and dynamic non-linearity. Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of their coherent dynamics is still lacking, which further constrains their applicability and efficiency. Consequently, these constraints have confined their use to spectrally inefficient intensity-modulation direct-detection links. In this work, we present a thorough study of MRM coherent dynamics, unlocking phase as a new dimension for MRM-based high-speed data transmission in advanced modulation formats. We demonstrate that the phase and intensity modulations of MRMs exhibit distinct yet coupled dynamics, limiting their direct application in higher-order modulation formats. This challenge can be addressed by embedding a pair of MRMs within a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in a push-pull configuration, enabling a bistable phase response and unchirped amplitude modulation. Furthermore, we show that its amplitude frequency response exhibits a distinct dependency on frequency detuning compared to phase and intensity modulations of MRMs, without strong peaking near resonance. Harnessing the ultra-fast coherent dynamics, we designed and experimentally demonstrated an ultra-compact, ultra-wide-bandwidth in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) modulator on a silicon chip fabricated using a CMOS-compatible photonic process. Achieving a record on-chip shoreline bandwidth density exceeding 5Tb/s/mm, our device enabled coherent transmission for symbol rates up to 180Gbaud and a net bit rate surpassing 1Tb/s over an 80km span, with modulation energy consumption as low as 10.4fJ/bit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced three-dimensional (3D) tracking methods are essential for studying particle dynamics across a wide range of complex systems, including multiphase flows, environmental and atmospheric sciences, colloidal science, biological and medical research, and industrial manufacturing processes. This review provides a comprehensive summary of 3D particle tracking and flow diagnostics using Digital Holography (DH). We begin by introducing the principles of DH, accompanied by a detailed discussion on numerical reconstruction. The review then explores various hardware setups used in DH, including inline, off-axis, and dual or multiple-view configurations, outlining their advantages and limitations. We also delve into different hologram processing methods, categorized into traditional multi-step, inverse, and machine learning-based approaches, providing in-depth insights into their applications for 3D particle tracking and flow diagnostics across multiple studies. The review concludes with a discussion on future prospects, emphasizing the significant role of machine learning in enabling accurate DH-based particle tracking and flow diagnostic techniques across diverse fields, such as manufacturing, environmental monitoring, and biological sciences.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of a Diamond Quantum Magnetometer for Biomagnetic Sensing: A Phantom Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a dry-type phantom to evaluate the performance of a diamond quantum magnetometer with a high sensitivity of about $6~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ from the viewpoint of practical measurement in biomagnetic sensing. The dry phantom is supposed to represent an equivalent current dipole (ECD) generated by brain activity, emulating an encephalomagnetic field. The spatial resolution of the magnetometer is evaluated to be sufficiently higher than the length of the variation in the encephalomagnetic field distribution. The minimum detectable ECD moment is evaluated to be 0.2 nA m by averaging about 8000 measurements for a standoff distance of 2.4 mm from the ECD. We also discuss the feasibility of detecting an ECD in the measurement of an encephalomagnetic field in humans. We conclude that it is feasible to detect an encephalomagnetic field from a shallow cortex area such as the primary somatosensory cortex.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of an active wheel rolling in circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrated granular matter constitutes a useful system for studying the physics of active matter. Usually, self-propulsion is induced in grains through suitable asymmetry in the particle design. In this paper, we show that a symmetrical mini wheel placed on a vibrating plate self-propels along circular trajectories, showing chiral active dynamics. The chiral activity emerges through a sequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the particle's kinetics. The fact that isotropy, fore-aft, and chiral symmetries are broken spontaneously leads to distinct statistics, which include a temporal evolution involving stochastic resetting, a non-Gaussian velocity distribution with multiple peaks, broad power-law curvature distribution, and a bounded chirality probability, along with a phase transition from passive achiral to active chiral state as a function of vibration amplitude. Our study establishes the vibrated wheel as a three-state chiral active system that can serve as a model experimental system to study the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of chiral active systems and can inspire novel locomotion strategies in robotics.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Here, we report the experimental observation of an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance effect, which is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. The spin current polarization and the corresponding magnetic field direction associated with the magnetoresistance extrema are largely determined by the Neel vector of the altermagnet, leading to a remarkable phase shift compared to that driven by a conventional relativistic spin current. Our work opens a door to unearthing luxuriant nonrelativistic quantum states of matter in emergent materials with unconventional spin degeneracy lifting.</description>

      <title>Lensless speckle reconstructive spectrometer via physics-aware neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speckle field yielded by disordered media is extensively employed for spectral measurements. Existing speckle reconstructive spectrometers (RSs) implemented by neural networks primarily rely on supervised learning, which necessitates large-scale spectra-speckle pairs. However, beyond system stability requirements for prolonged data collection, generating diverse spectra with high resolution and finely labeling them is particularly difficult. A lack of variety in datasets hinders the generalization of neural networks to new spectrum types. Here we avoid this limitation by introducing PhyspeNet, an untrained spectrum reconstruction framework combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a physical model of a chaotic optical cavity. Without pre-training and prior knowledge about the spectrum under test, PhyspeNet requires only a single captured speckle for various multi-wavelength reconstruction tasks. Experimentally, we demonstrate a lens-free, snapshot RS system by leveraging the one-to-many mapping between spatial and spectrum domains in a random medium. Dual-wavelength peaks separated by 2 pm can be distinguished, and a maximum working bandwidth of 40 nm is achieved with high measurement accuracy. This approach establishes a new paradigm for neural network-based RS systems, entirely eliminating reliance on datasets while ensuring that computational results exhibit a high degree of generalizability and physical explainability.</description>

      <title>Actuation and mapping of SAW-induced high-frequency wavefields on suspended graphene membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High frequency acoustic devices based on two-dimensional (2D) materials are unique platforms to design and manipulate the spatiotemporal response of acoustic waves for next-generation sensing and contactless actuation applications. Conventional methods for actuating suspended membranes, however, cannot be applied to all 2D materials, or are limited in frequency. There is, therefore, a need for a universal high-frequency, on-chip actuation technique that can be applied to all types of membranes. Here, we demonstrate that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can be used to efficiently actuate suspended 2D materials by exciting suspended graphene membranes with high-frequency (375 MHz) Rayleigh surface waves and mapping the resulting vibration field with atomic force acoustic microscopy (AFAM). Acoustic waves travelling from supported to suspended graphene experience a reduction in acoustic wavelength from 10 \mu m to ~2 \mu um due to the decrease in effective bending rigidity, leading to a decrease in wave velocity on suspended graphene. By varying the excitation frequency, we observed a change in phase velocity from ~160 m/s to ~700 m/s. This behavior is consistent with the nonlinear dispersion of acoustic waves, as predicted by plate theory, in suspended graphene membranes. The geometry and bending rigidity of the membrane thus play key roles in modulating the acoustic wave pattern and wavelength. This combined SAW actuation and AFAM visualization scheme can give new insights into the fundamentals of acoustic transport at the nanoscale limit and provides a route towards the manipulation of localized wavefields for on-chip patterning and transport over 2D materials surfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anharmonic Effects on the Superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S at High Pressures: a First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making use of first-principles calculations we analyze the effect of quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the crystal structure and superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S, one of the lowest enthalpy structures in the C-S-H system, in the 150-300 GPa pressure range within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We predict a correction to the crystal structure, which is formed by an H3S lattice and CH4 molecules, the phonon spectra, and the pressure-dependent superconducting critical temperatures, which have been estimated in previous calculations without considering ionic fluctuations on the crystal structure and assuming the harmonic approximation for the lattice dynamics. Our results show that quantum ionic fluctuations have an impact on the distance between H atoms and S atoms in the H3S host lattice, pushing it towards more symmetric bonds, while the methane molecules are barely affected. According to our anharmonic phonon spectra, this structure is dynamically stable above 150 GPa, which is 30 GPa lower than the pressure at which the harmonic approximation predicts the emergence of an instability. As a consequence of the strong anharmonic enhancement of the phonon frequencies, the electron-phonon coupling constant is suppressed by 46% at 200 GPa, and even more at lower pressures. As a result, the superconducting critical temperature is overestimated by around 50 K at 200 GPa, such that it falls below 150 K in the whole pressure range studied. Our results underline that ternary hydrides are subject to strong anharmonic effects on their structural, vibrational, and superconducting properties.</description>

Abstract: Mechanical and elastic properties of materials are among the most fundamental quantities for many engineering and industrial applications. Here, we present a formulation that is efficient and accurate for calculating the elastic and bending rigidity tensors of crystalline solids, leveraging interatomic force constants and long-wavelength perturbation theory. Crucially, in the long-wavelength limit, lattice vibrations induce macroscopic electric fields which further couple with the propagation of elastic waves, and a separate treatment on the long-range electrostatic interactions is thereby required to obtain elastic properties under the appropriate electrical boundary conditions. A cluster expansion of the charge density response and dielectric screening function in the long-wavelength limit has been developed to efficiently extract multipole and dielectric tensors of arbitrarily high order. We implement the proposed method in a first-principles framework and perform extensive validations on silicon, NaCl, GaAs and rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ as well as monolayer graphene, hexagonal BN, MoS$_2$ and InSe, obtaining good to excellent agreement with other theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. Notably, we establish that multipolar interactions up to at least octupoles are necessary to obtain the accurate short-circuit elastic tensor of bulk materials, while higher orders beyond octupole interactions are required to converge the bending rigidity tensor of 2D crystals. The present approach greatly simplifies the calculations of bending rigidities and will enable the automated characterization of the mechanical properties of novel functional materials.</description>

Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.</description>

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>
