      <title>Flow Improving Devices For Marine Propulsers. Concept Design Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-improving devices (FIDs) are used the most effectively for the reduction of noise and vibration induced by a propulsor. These devices may also increase the efficiency of a propulsor and in some cases should be considered and designed as a part of an Integrated Propulsor, for example, non-axis symmetrical ducts. The FIDs may be naturally subdivided into two types: active and passive. The active ones are powered, such as the devices for local suction and injection of water, air, or polymer solutions, devices for local heating, etc. Passive FIDs are the ones that, generally speaking, use the power of inflow. Sometimes the power is lost unless not used for flow improvement, this is how the energy saving is achieved. Many passive FIDs are based on the effect of longitudinal vortices working in a boundary layer of a hull. The traversal velocities induced by these vortices redistribute the longitudinal velocities in a boundary layer of a hull and thus affect the circumferential non-uniformity of a propeller's inflow. The core of several new solutions of FIDs proposed in this document is a non-axis-symmetrical ring wing placed upstream of the propeller between the propeller and the appendages. Several arrangements are considered in which the Ring Wing functions differently but always delivers a positive effect on the Propulsor.</description>

      <title>Learning second-order TVD flux limiters using differentiable solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven framework for learning optimal second-order total variation diminishing (TVD) flux limiters via differentiable simulations. In our fully differentiable finite volume solvers, the limiter functions are replaced by neural networks. By representing the limiter as a pointwise convex linear combination of the Minmod and Superbee limiters, we enforce both second-order accuracy and TVD constraints at all stages of training. Our approach leverages gradient-based optimization through automatic differentiation, allowing a direct backpropagation of errors from numerical solutions to the limiter parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on various hyperbolic conservation laws, including the linear advection equation, the Burgers' equation, and the one-dimensional Euler equations. Remarkably, a limiter trained solely on linear advection exhibits strong generalizability, surpassing the accuracy of most classical flux limiters across a range of problems with shocks and discontinuities. The learned flux limiters can be readily integrated into existing computational fluid dynamics codes, and the proposed methodology also offers a flexible pathway to systematically develop and optimize flux limiters for complex flow problems.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling for acoustic microstreaming produced by a gas bubble undergoing asymmetric oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact solution is developed for the bubble-induced acoustic microstreaming in the case of a gas bubble undergoing asymmetric oscillations. The modeling is based on the decomposition of the solenoidal, first- and second-order, vorticity fields into poloidal and toroidal components. The result is valid for small amplitude bubble oscillations without restriction on the size of the viscous boundary layer $(2{\nu}/{\omega})^{(1/2)}$ in comparison to the bubble radius. The nonspherical distortions of the bubble interface are decomposed over the set of orthonormal spherical harmonics ${Y_n^m} ({\theta},{\phi})$ of degree $n$ and order $m$. The present theory describes the steady flow produced by the nonspherical oscillations $(n,{\pm}m)$ that occur at a frequency different from that of the spherical oscillation as in the case of a parametrically-excited surface oscillation. The three-dimensional aspect of the streaming pattern is revealed as well as the particular flow signatures associated to different asymmetric oscillations.</description>

      <title>Thermal Management of Lithium-Ion Batteries: A Comparative Study of Phase Change Materials and Air-Cooling Systems Equipped with Fins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are extensively utilized as the primary power source for electric vehicles due to their high energy density, environmental friendliness and lightweight nature. However, their performance and safety are highly dependent on operating temperature. Therefore, a battery thermal management system (BTMS) is essential to ensure the reliable operation and safety of electric vehicles. This study presents a battery thermal management system incorporating phase change material (PCM) and air cooling in a cylindrical lithium-ion cell with fins to enhance heat dissipation. The effects of each system on maximum and minimum temperature, and temperature uniformity along the battery cell are analyzed. Additionally, the impact of fins in both systems is evaluated against a finless cell. A numerical analysis utilizing ANSYS software and the finite volume method (FVM) is performed to evaluate the cooling performance of the systems. The results show that PCM reduces both the maximum and minimum temperatures compared to the air cooling system due to the phase change mechanism. In the finless battery case, the maximum temperature decreases from 316 K to 304 K when using PCM instead of the air cooling system. Also, in the same fin-based battery, the minimum temperature decreases from 307 K to 302 K by using PCM instead of the air cooling system, leading to improved temperature stability. The results indicate that, in general, the fins help reduce the maximum cell temperature when compared to the case without fins in both cases. Using rectangular fins reduces the maximum temperature by approximately 3% compared to a finless battery in the air cooling system. Additionally, the presence of fins reduces the temperature difference along the battery, ensuring a more uniform temperature distribution, such that, in the PCM system with rectangular fins, the temperature difference remains below 1 K.</description>

      <title>Flow birefringence of shear-thinning fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</description>

      <title>The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Framework for Multiphase Fluid Flows: Laminar, Turbulent, and Active</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a powerful framework for the study of the statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics of multiphase fluids. We provide an introduction to the equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of systems in which coexisting phases, distinguished from each other by scalar order parameters, are separated by an interface. We then introduce the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) PDEs for two immiscible fluids and generalisations for (a) coexisting phases with different viscosities, (b) CHNS with gravity, (c) the three-component fluids (CHNS3), and (d) the CHNS for active fluids. We discuss mathematical issues of the regularity of solutions of the CHNS PDEs. Finally we provide a survey of the rich variety of results that have been obtained by numerical studies of CHNS-type PDEs for diverse systems, including bubbles in turbulent flows, antibubbles, droplet and liquid-lens mergers, turbulence in the active-CHNS model, and its generalisation that can lead to a self-propelled droplet.</description>

      <title>Characterization of porous nanoparticles using the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous capsules have been the subject of intense investigation in the field of drug delivery. One of the essential properties of such particles, which requires characterization, is their structure. Many experimental techniques have been used for this purpose, such as wide-angle neutron or X-ray scattering, or light scattering. Herein, we report theoretical data on the relationship between the size, porosity and drag force of porous particles. Data were obtained from a numerical procedure based on the lattice Boltzmann method for the calculation of the creeping flow over porous spherical objects. Previous analytical solutions to the hydrodynamic equations yielded different predictions for the drag force under conditions of high permeability. In the light of our findings, we compared our data to previous divergent analytical solutions and analyzed experimental results for dynamic and static light scattering of porous membrane vesicles Our findings strongly indicate a potential source of error that has led to inconsistencies in DLS measurements when compared to other techniques.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Boltzmann equation for weakly coupled quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a comment of N. Chapuis and L. Bocquet, Sustainable Energy Fuels, 2025, DOI: 10.1039/D4SE01366B which title is "Boosting large scale capacitive harvesting of osmotic power by dynamical matching of ion exchange kinetics". In this work, the authors present an experimental process that shows how it is possible to set up a reverse electrodialysis cell capable of achieving power values of 5 W/m2. This value is the profitability threshold. Our work challenges this claim and questions whether the proposed technique can be scaled up, as well as the modeling of the process.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulation of interacting turbulent and rarefied gas flows in the DSMC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiscale stochastic-deterministic coupling method is proposed to investigate the complex interactions between turbulent and rarefied gas flows within a unified framework. This method intermittently integrates the general synthetic iterative scheme with the shear stress transport turbulence model into the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach, enabling the simulation of gas flows across the free-molecular, transition, slip, and turbulent regimes. First, the macroscopic synthetic equations, derived directly from DSMC, are coupled with the turbulence model to establish a constitutive relation that incorporates not only turbulent and laminar transport coefficients but also higher-order terms accounting for rarefaction effects. Second, the macroscopic properties, statistically sampled over specific time intervals in DSMC, along with the turbulent properties provided by the turbulence model, serve as initial conditions for solving the macroscopic synthetic equations. Finally, the simulation particles in DSMC are updated based on the macroscopic properties obtained from the synthetic equations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method asymptotically converges to either the turbulence model or DSMC results, adaptively adjusting to different flow regimes. Then, this coupling method is applied to simulate an opposing jet surrounded by hypersonic rarefied gas flows, revealing significant variations in surface properties due to the interplay of turbulent and rarefied effects. This study presents an efficient methodology for simulating the complex interplay between rarefied and turbulent flows, establishing a foundational framework for investigating the coupled effects of turbulence, hypersonic conditions, and chemical reactions in rarefied gas dynamics in the future.</description>

      <title>Insights into the mechanics of pure and bacteria-laden sessile whole blood droplet evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mechanics of evaporation and precipitate formation in pure and bacteria-laden sessile whole blood droplets in the context of disease diagnostics. Using experimental and theoretical analysis, we show evaporation process has three stages based on evaporation rate. In the first stage, edge evaporation results in a gelated contact line along the periphery through sol-gel phase transition. The intermediate stage consists of gelated front propagating radially inwards due to capillary flow and droplet height regression in pinned mode, forming a wet-gel phase. We unearthed that the gelation of the entire droplet occurs in the second stage, and the wet-gel formed contains trace amount of water. In the final slowest stage, wet-gel transforms into dry-gel, leading to desiccation-induced stress forming diverse crack patterns in the precipitate. Slow evaporation in the final stage is quantitatively measured using evaporation of trace water and associated transient delamination of the precipitate. Using axisymmetric lubrication approximation, we compute the transient droplet height profile and the erythrocytes concentration for the first two stages of evaporation. We show that the precipitate thickness profile computed from the theoretical analysis conforms to the optical profilometry measurements. We show that the drop evaporation rate and final dried residue pattern do not change appreciably within the parameter variation of the bacterial concentration typically found in bacterial infection of living organisms. However, at exceedingly high bacterial concentrations, the cracks formed in the coronal region deviate from the typical radial cracks found in lower concentrations.</description>

      <title>Using Biot-Savart boundary conditions for unbounded external flow on Eulerian meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel boundary condition for incompressible Eulerian simulations formulated using a Biot-Savart vorticity integral that maintains high-accuracy results even when the domain boundary is within a body-length of immersed solid boundaries. The key prerequisite to accurately couple the Biot-Savart condition to the Eulerian velocity and pressure fields is including the influence of the vorticity generated at the immersed boundaries during the incompressible-flow projection step. While the resulting linear operator for the pressure is non-local, it can be efficiently solved by partitioning it into the standard local Poisson operator and the Biot-Savart update. We use oct-tree clustering for the Fast Multi-level Method (FM$\ell$M) to reduce the computational cost of the evaluation of the Biot-Savart integral on the boundaries of a 3D simulation with $N$ points from $O(N^{5/3})$ to $O(N)$ and show that this has bounded errors. We show that the new method captures the analytical added-mass force of accelerating 2D and 3D plates exactly and matches experimentally measured wake development even when the entire domain only extends 1/2 diameter from the plate. The new method also predicts accurate time-varying forces for a 2D circle and 3D sphere regardless of domain size, while classical boundary conditions require a domain more than 100 times larger in 2D to converge on the new method's result. Finally, we study the highly sensitive 2D deflected wakes produced by high frequency flapping foils to the new boundary conditions and show that truncating the deflected wake within four cord-lengths of the body changes the body force amplitudes by 10-40%. Doubling the wake size recovers the asymptotic results to within 5%.</description>

      <title>Response of a turbulent boundary layer to steady, square-wave-type transverse wall-forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatial evolution of a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL) imposed by a square-wave (SqW) of steady spanwise wall-forcing, which varies along the streamwise direction ($x$). The SqW wall-forcing is imposed experimentally via a series of streamwise periodic belts running in opposite spanwise directions, following the methodology of Knoop et al. (Exp. Fluids, vol 65, 2024), with the streamwise extent increased to beyond $\sim 11$ times the boundary layer thickness (${\delta}_o$) in the present study. This unique setup is leveraged to investigate the influence of viscous-scaled wavelength of SqW wall-forcing on the turbulent drag reduction (DR) efficacy for $\lambda^+_x = $ 471 (sub-optimal), 942 (near-optimal), and 1884 (post-optimal conditions), at fixed viscous-scaled wall-forcing amplitude, $A^+ = 12$, and friction Reynolds number, $Re_\tau = 960$. The TBL's response to this wall-forcing is elucidated by drawing inspiration from established knowledge on traditionally studied sinusoidal forcing (SinW), based on analysis of the streamwise-phase variation of the Stokes strain rate (SSR). The analysis reveals the SqW forcing to be characterized by a combination of two markedly different SSR regimes whose influence on the overlying turbulence is found to depend on the forcing waveform: sub-phase-I of local and strong impulses of SSR downstream of the half- ($\lambda_x$/2) and full-phase ($\lambda_x$) locations, associated with a reversal in spanwise forcing directions, leading to significant turbulence attenuation, and sub-phase-II of near-zero SSR over the remainder of forcing phase that enables turbulence recovery (when wall-forcing magnitudes and direction remain constant).</description>

      <title>A global similarity correction for the RANS modeling of natural convection in unstably stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a global similarity correction for Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) modeling of buoyancy effects in unstably stratified flows. Conventional two-equation RANS models (e.g., the $k$-$\varepsilon$ model) lack a clear criterion for incorporating unstable buoyancy effects in their scale-determining equations (e.g., $\varepsilon$-equation). To address this gap, a global correction function is introduced, derived from a generalized algebraic formulation that incorporates available potential energy as an additional parameter. This function reproduces a global similarity law commonly observed in natural convection flows--for instance, the correlation among the Nusselt, Rayleigh, and Prandtl numbers, which can be approximately expressed as a single power law over a wide parameter range. A calibration method is proposed in which an approximate analytical solution for Rayleigh--B\'enard convection is obtained via equilibrium analysis, confirming that the proposed model captures similarity relations not addressed by conventional one-point closures. Numerical results show significantly improved agreement with experimental data, accurately reproducing Nusselt number dependencies over broad ranges of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in unstably stratified flows, such as Rayleigh--B\'enard convection and two types of internally heated convection. The method remains fully compatible with standard RANS frameworks and reverts to traditional turbulence treatments in shear-driven flows where buoyant effects are negligible. By introducing only a single, simple, algebraic global function in the conventional $\varepsilon$-equation, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of buoyancy-driven turbulence simulations.</description>

Abstract: While Moore's Law has approached its physical limits lately, the high integration and miniaturisation of electronics have also brought another thermal failure obstacle. Previous studies on single-phase flow demanded significant pump power to achieve higher CHF, but this approach risked exceeding the chip's mechanical limits and complicating packaging. The elevated junction temperature (above 175 C) of third-generation semiconductors makes them ideal for two-phase water cooling which utilizes the huge latent heat during boiling of water to minimize the flow rate and maximize the COP. In this work, we designed an embedded hierarchical microchannel heat sink for heat transfer by deionised water two-phase cooling. We observed an unprecedented Critical Heat Flux (CHF) of 1682W cm-2 with COP up to 23615 at flow rate of 3.0 ml s-1, which means Only 70 mW of power is needed to take away the heat on the 1682 W per square centimetre chip, corresponding to a 3-fold increase compared to single-phase microchannels with same flowrate. At a high flow rate of 10 ml s-1, we even achieved a remarkable heat flux of 2500 W cm-2. This technology is anticipated to overcome the bottleneck in electronic thermal management.</description>
