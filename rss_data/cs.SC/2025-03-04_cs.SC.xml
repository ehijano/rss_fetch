      <title>Solving generic parametric linear matrix inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) $A = A_0+x_1A_1+\cdots+x_nA_n\succeq 0$ with the $A_i$'s being $m\times m$ symmetric matrices, with entries in a ring $\mathcal{R}$. When $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{R}$, the feasibility problem consists in deciding whether the $x_i$'s can be instantiated to obtain a positive semidefinite matrix. When $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Q}[y_1, \ldots, y_t]$, the problem asks for a formula on the parameters $y_1, \ldots, y_t$, which describes the values of the parameters for which the specialized LMI is feasible. This problem can be solved using general quantifier elimination algorithms, with a complexity that is exponential in $n$. In this work, we leverage the LMI structure of the problem to design an algorithm that computes a formula $\Phi$ describing a dense subset of the feasible region of parameters, under genericity assumptions. The complexity of this algorithm is exponential in $n, m$ and $t$ but becomes polynomial in $n$ when $m$ is fixed. We apply the algorithm to a parametric sum-of-squares problem and to the convergence analyses of certain first-order optimization methods, which are both known to be equivalent to the feasibility of certain parametric LMIs, hence demonstrating its practical interest.</description>

      <title>From Understanding the World to Intervening in It: A Unified Multi-Scale Framework for Embodied Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose AUKAI, an Adaptive Unified Knowledge-Action Intelligence for embodied cognition that seamlessly integrates perception, memory, and decision-making via multi-scale error feedback. Interpreting AUKAI as an embedded world model, our approach simultaneously predicts state transitions and evaluates intervention utility. The framework is underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis drawn from convergence theory, optimal control, and Bayesian inference, which collectively establish conditions for convergence, stability, and near-optimal performance. Furthermore, we present a hybrid implementation that combines the strengths of neural networks with symbolic reasoning modules, thereby enhancing interpretability and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of AUKAI through a detailed application in robotic navigation and obstacle avoidance, and we outline comprehensive experimental plans to validate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Conjecturing from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a self-learning approach for conjecturing of induction predicates on a dataset of 16197 problems derived from the OEIS. These problems are hard for today's SMT and ATP systems because they require a combination of inductive and arithmetical reasoning.
  Starting from scratch, our approach consists of a feedback loop that iterates between (i) training a neural translator to learn the correspondence between the problems solved so far and the induction predicates useful for them, (ii) using the trained neural system to generate many new induction predicates for the problems, (iii) fast runs of the z3 prover attempting to prove the problems using the generated predicates, (iv) using heuristics such as predicate size and solution speed on the proved problems to choose the best predicates for the next iteration of training.
  The algorithm discovers on its own many interesting induction predicates, ultimately solving 5565 problems, compared to 2265 problems solved by CVC5, Vampire or Z3 in 60 seconds.</description>
