      <title>Discovery of a pair of very metal-poor stars enriched in neutron-capture elements: The proto-disk r-II star BPS CS 29529-0089 and the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus r-I star TYC 9219-2422-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R-process enhanced metal-poor stars (\EuFe$\geq+0.3$ and \FeH$\leq-1.0$) are rare objects whose study can provide clues to the astrophysical sites of the rapid neutron capture process. In this study, we investigate the detailed chemical abundance patterns of two of these anomalous stars, originally identified among stars observed by the GALAH survey. Our aim is to obtain the detailed chemical abundance pattern of these stars with spectroscopy at higher resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We use a calibration of the infrared flux method to determine accurate effective temperatures, and \Gaia~ parallaxes together with broadband photometry and theoretical bolometric corrections to determine surface gravity. Metallicities and chemical abundances are determined with model atmospheres and spectrum synthesis. We also integrate stellar orbits for a complete chemodynamic analysis. e determine abundances for up to 47 chemical species (44 elements), of which 27 are neutron-capture elements. Corrections because of deviations from the local thermodynamical equilibrium are applied to the metallicities and 12 elements. We find that one of the stars, BPS CS 29529-0089, is a proto-disk star of the Milky Way of r-II type, with \EuFe=+1.79~dex. The second star, TYC 9219-2422-1, is part of the halo and associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger event. It is of r-I type with [Eu/Fe] = +0.54. Abundances of Th are also provided for both stars. BPS CS 29529-0089 is the most extreme example of r-process enhanced star known with disk-like kinematics and that is not carbon enhanced. TYC 9219-2422-1 is found to be an archetypal Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus star. Their abundances of C, Mg, Ni, Sc, Mn, and Al seem consistent with expectations for stars enriched by a single population III core collapse supernova, despite their relatively high metallicities ([Fe/H] $\sim$ $-$2.4).</description>

      <title>Modeling Asteroseismic Yields for the Roman Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) of the Roman Space Telescope will take high cadence data of the Galactic bulge. We investigate the asteroseismic potential of this survey for red giants. We simulate the detectability of global asteroseismic frequencies, $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$, by modify ing Kepler data to match nominal GBTDS observing strategies, considering different noise models, observing cadences, and detection algorithms. Our baseline case, using conservative assumptions, consistently leads to asteroseismic $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ detection probabilities above 80% for red clump and red giant branch stars brighter than 16th magnitude in Roman's F146 filter. We then inject these detection probabilities into a Galaxia model of the bulge to estimate asteroseismic yields. For our nominal case, we detect 290,000 stars in total, with 185,000 detections in the bulge. Different assumptions give bulge yields from 135,000 to 349,000 stars. For stars with measured $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that we can recover $\Delta\nu$ in 21% to 42% of red clump stars, and 69% to 92% of RGB stars. Implications for survey strategy and asteroseismic population studies are discussed more.</description>

      <title>Temporal Variations in Asteroseismic Frequencies of KIC 6106415: Insights into the Solar-Stellar Activity from GOLF and Kepler Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies instrument aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory has provided over two decades of continuous, high-precision data, enabling detailed measurements of the Sun's oscillation frequencies. These oscillations, analyzed through Doppler velocity shifts, offer invaluable insights into the Sun's internal structure and dynamics using the methods of helioseismology. This methodology has been extended beyond the Sun to the study of other stars, leveraging data from various space missions. Notably, NASA's Kepler mission, in operation from 2009 until 2018, observed over 500,000 stars, analyzing brightness variations over time and generating a vast database for asteroseismic studies. This investigation focuses on the solar-type star KIC 6106415, comparing its oscillation frequencies with those derived from GOLF data. By analyzing frequency patterns and mode lifetimes, we explore the similarities and differences in internal structures, stellar evolution, and magnetic activity cycles between KIC 6106415 and the Sun. Our analysis reveals that KIC 6106415 exhibits starspot numbers similar to the Sun, peaking at an estimated 175, which is consistent with its faster rotation rate. The data suggest that KIC 6106415 may have shorter magnetic activity cycles than the Sun, reinforcing the established link between stellar rotation and magnetic field generation in solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>An Oasis in the Brown Dwarf Desert: Confirmation of Two Low-mass Transiting Brown Dwarfs Discovered by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the intermediate-mass siblings of stars and planets, brown dwarfs (BDs) are vital to study for a better understanding of how objects change across the planet-to-star mass range. Here, we report two low-mass transiting BD systems discovered by TESS, TOI-4776 (TIC 196286578) and TOI-5422 (TIC 80611440), located in an under-populated region of the BD mass-period space. These two systems have comparable masses but different ages. The younger and larger BD is TOI-4776b with $32.0^{+1.9}_{-1.8}M_{Jup}$ and $1.018^{+0.048}_{-0.043}R_{Jup}$, orbiting a late-F star about $5.4^{+2.8}_{-2.2}$ Gyr old in a 10.4138$\pm$0.000014 day period. The older TOI-5422b has $27.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1}M_{Jup}$ and $0.815^{+0.031}_{-0.026}R_{Jup}$ in a 5.3772$\pm$0.00001 day orbit around a subgiant star about $8.2\pm2.4$ Gyr old. Compared with substellar mass-radius (M-R) evolution models, TOI-4776b has an inflated radii. In contrast, TOI-5422b is slightly "underluminous" with respect to model predictions, which is not commonly seen in the BD population. In addition, TOI-5422 shows apparent photometric modulations with a rotation period of 10.75$\pm$0.54 day found by rotation analysis, and the stellar inclination angle is obtained to be $I_{\star}=75.52^{+9.96}_{-11.79}$$^{\circ}$. Therefore, it is likely that TOI-5422b is spinning up the host star and its orbit is aligned with the stellar spin axis.</description>

      <title>First VLBI Imaging of SiO $v=0$, $J=1 \rightarrow 0$ Masers in VY Canis Majoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We achieved the first VLBI detections of the ground vibrational state ($v=0$) $^{28}$SiO (hereafter, SiO) and $^{29}$SiO masers of the $J=1\rightarrow 0$ rotational transitions, towards the 25 \Msun ~red supergiant (RSG) star, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa), taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) telescopes that coordinate with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. In addition, we successfully detected the SiO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ transition in the $v=3$ state towards VY CMa for the first time with VLBI. The SiO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ maser spot in $v=0$ state was detected in the cross-power spectra taken with the baselines involving the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The combination of previously reported absolute astrometry and the relative astrometry technique allowed us to derive the location of the SiO $v=0$ maser spot, {(RA, DEC) = ( 7${\rm ^h}$ 22${\rm ^m}$ 58.$^{\rm s}$32, $-$25$^{\circ}$ 46$^{\prime}$ 3.$^{\prime\prime}$4) in J2000 at an absolute positional accuracy of $\sim$100 milliarcseconds (mas). The SiO $v=0$ maser spot is offset by the amount of ($\Delta$RA, $\Delta$DEC)=($-$150, $-$300) (mas) to the southwest of the stellar position, suggesting that the $v = 0$ maser spot is associated with its outflow activity.} This observational study demonstrates that the brightest SiO $v=0$ maser spot is compact (3 mas), producing an extremely high brightness of $\sim$ 10$^7$ K. This indicates that the SiO $v=0$ maser action may originate from strong shocks in the stellar wind emanating from this extreme RSG that leads to its intense mass ejection.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the static input size of neural networks in flare forecasting by using spatial pyramid pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial extension of active regions (ARs) of the Sun can vary from one case to the next. This is a problem when studying solar flares with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as they generally use input images of a fixed size. Different processes can be performed to retrieve a database with homogeneous-sized data, such as resizing. Unfortunately, key features can be lost or distorted during these processes. This can lead to a deterioration of the ability of CNNs to classify flares of different soft X-ray classes, especially those from ARs with complex structures. Our work aims to implement and test a CNN architecture that retains the full features of the original resolution of the input images. We compare the performance of two CNN architectures for solar flare prediction: the first is a traditional CNN with resized input whereas the other implements a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layer without any input resizing. Both are trained on the Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch line-of-sight magnetogram database. We also study two cases of binary classification. In the first case, our model distinguishes ARs producing flares in less than 24h of class greater or equal to C1.0 from ARs producing flares in more than 24h or never; in the second case, it distinguishes ARs producing flares in less than 24h of class greater or equal to M1.0 from the other ARs. Our models implementing an SPP layer outperform the traditional CNN models when predicting flares greater or equal to C1.0 within 24h. However, their performances degrade sharply along the other models studied in this paper, when trained to classify images greater or equal to M1.0 flares. The degradation in SPP models when classifying only images greater or equal to M1.0 flares as positive may be attributed to its success in identifying features that appear in ARs a few hours before the flare, independently of their soft X-ray class.</description>

      <title>Characterising planetary material accreted by cool helium atmosphere white dwarfs using an exponentially decaying disc model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) observations and model atmosphere analysis for two nearby, cool, helium-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that have been polluted by accretion: WD J1927-0355 and WD J2141-3300. Detected elements common to both white dwarfs are Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni, with additional detections of Na, Al, Si and Sr in WD J2141-3300. We present an approach for inferring the composition of the accreted material, by adopting a physically motivated model in which the mass accretion rate decays exponentially with time, which provides constraints on the time since the start of the accretion event. The accretion events were most likely to have began at least 1 Myr ago, however the characteristic disc lifetime could not be constrained due to degeneracies. Both white dwarfs were found to have accreted bulk planetary material with compositions similar to that of both bulk Earth and chondritic meteorites. The parent bodies causing pollution in both cases were inferred to be the mass of a small moon or dwarf planet.</description>

      <title>The Chemical Composition of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides a brief introduction to the chemical composition of the Sun. The focus of the chapter is on results obtained from the physical analysis of the solar photosphere. Data obtained from meteorites, solar wind and corona measurements, as well as helioseismology, and solar neutrinos are briefly reviewed. The elemental and isotopic composition of the solar system is derived by combining the solar and meteoritic data. The cosmochemical and astronomical abundance scales are described. The results of the determinations of the protosolar chemical composition, as well as the initial and present-day mass fractions of hydrogen, helium, and metals (X, Y, Z) for the solar system are presented in extensive tables. All tables are also available in machine-readable form via Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14988840</description>

      <title>Determining the Polarisation of a Coronal Standing Kink Oscillation Using Spectral Imaging Techniques with the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal oscillations offer insight into energy transport and driving in the solar atmosphere. Knowing its polarisation state helps constrain a wave's displacement and velocity amplitude, improving estimates of wave energy flux and deposition rate. We demonstrate a method to combine imaging and spectral data to infer the polarisation of a coronal loop's standing kink wave, without the need for multiple instruments or multiple lines of sight. We use the unique capabilities of the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) to observe the standing kink mode of an off-limb coronal loop perturbed by an eruption. The full off-disk corona is observed using the 1074 nm Fe XIII spectral line, providing Doppler velocity, intensity and line width. By tracking the oscillatory motion of a loop apex in a time-distance map, we extract the line-of-sight (Doppler) velocity of the inhomogeneity as it sways and compare it with the derivative of its plane-of-sky displacement. This analysis provides the loop's velocity in two perpendicular planes as it oscillates with a period of $8.9^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ minutes. Through detailed analysis of the phase relation between the transverse velocities we infer the kink oscillation to be horizontally polarised, oscillating in a plane tilted $-13.6^{+2.9}_{-3.0}$ degrees away from the plane of sky. The line widths show a periodic enhancement during the kink oscillation, exhibiting both the kink period and its double. This study is the first to combine direct imaging and spectral data to infer the polarisation of a coronal loop oscillation from a single viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Linear and non-linear models for large-amplitude radial pulsation in faint blue stars (BLAPs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of large-amplitude pulsations in faint blue stars (BLAPs) provides both challenges for stellar pulsation theory and opportunities to explore the late evolution of low-mass stars. This paper explores the radial-mode stability of stars across parameter space occupied by BLAPs. Models are constructed for homogeneous stellar envelopes and are agnostic of evolution. Linear non-adiabatic models demonstrate the major requirement for pulsations to be enrichment of iron and nickel in the driving zone to a few times the solar abundance. There is no constraint on mass. Non-linear models demonstrate that BLAP pulsations will be of large amplitude and will show strong shocks at minimum radius. A variety of light-curve shapes are found across the BLAP instability strip, accounting for the variety observed. Linearised period relations are derived from the non-linear models. The phase of maximum luminosity relative to minimum radius is correlated with effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), preceding for cool stars and following for hot stars, and split if close to minimum radius. In both linear and non-linear cases, most models pulsate in the fundamental mode (F). First-overtone (1H) pulsations are excited on the low luminosity blue side of the instability region and become more prevalent at higher mass. The period ratio $P_{\rm 1H}/P_{\rm F}=0.81$ contrasts with the classical Cepheid value (0.70 - 0.75). The transition from F to 1H mode pulsations follows a period-mass relation; the F-mode pulsators adjacent to the transition show a reverse shock. At high $T_{\rm eff}$ some non-linear models show unstable overtone modes up to 5H and multi-mode behaviour. The linear and non-linear analyses concur on the red-edge of the instability region, but the non-linear blue edge is hotter.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merging our supernova code F{\sc{ornax}} with the Box3D fast-flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, we explore the effects of fast-flavor conversion (FFC) in state-of-the-art 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova simulations. We find that after a few tens of milliseconds after bounce the FFC emerges just interior to and exterior to the stalled shock wave. It does not obtain in the PNS core nor near the average neutrinosphere radii. Interior to the shock, this results in a temporary change in the net neutrino heating rate of $\sim$10\%, due mostly to a hardening of the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrino spectra, despite the decrease in their corresponding neutrino number fluxes. In 1D, the hydrodynamic effects are not large, with increases in the stalled shock radius by of order ten to twenty kilometers that abate within a few hundred milliseconds. In 2D, the hydrodynamic effect of the FFC is a bit more noticeable, resulting in slightly earlier explosions for models for lower-mass progenitors, but also potentially inhibiting explosions for some higher-mass progenitors. Fast-flavor conversion continues to operate at larger radii at later times. The net result is a shift upward in the $\nu_{\mu}$ energy and number luminosities and a shift downward in the same quantities for both the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrinos. There seems to be a trend at very large radii and later times towards partial species and spectral equipartition. If this is true, it could be an interesting feature of supernova neutrino detection at later times in underground and under-ice facilities.</description>

      <title>SN 2024iss: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Implications for a Yellow Supergiant Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the multi-band photometric observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN)
  2024iss with ultra-violet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths
  starting one day after the explosion. The UV and optical light curves show the first peak two days after the explosion date. Following a first peak,
  a secondary maximum is observed in the optical and NIR bands, similar to SNe IIb with double-peaked light curves.
  The quasi-bolometric light curve shows the fast decay until a week after the explosion.
  From the analysis of the bolometric light curve, the ejecta mass and kinetic energy are estimated to be $M_{ej}=2.8\pm0.6~M_{\odot}$ and $E_{kin}=9.4\pm4.1\times10^{50}$ erg. The
  mass of the radioactive $^{56}$Ni is estimated to be $M(^{56}Ni)=0.2~M_{\odot}$.
  Fitting a black-body function to the spectral energy distribution reveals that the photospheric temperature exhibits a rapid exponential decline during the first week after the explosion.
  An analytic model describing the cooling emission after shock breakout provides a reasonable explanation for the observed temperature evolution.
  From these ejecta parameters, we calculated the progenitor radius to be $R_{pro}=50-340$~$R_{\odot}$. We conclude that these explosion properties are consistent with a core-collapse explosion from a yellow supergiant (YSG) progenitor.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar infrared emission bands (AIBs). However, current spectral databases for AIB analysis face limitations because of the neglect of anharmonicity in vibrations and of temperature effects, which result from the high computational cost of traditional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic infrared (IR) spectra while accounting for temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We apply MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1\,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its ability to handle large molecular systems. Our results suggest that MLMD can facilitate the creation of extensive molecular spectral databases, advancing AI-assisted analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly with upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Resonant Drag Instabilities for Polydisperse Dust, I. The Acoustic Resonant Drag Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic instabilities that can occur whenever there exists a relative velocity between gas and dust. These instabilities have predominantly been studied for single grain sizes, for which a strong interaction can be found between drifting dust and a travelling gas wave, leading to fast-growing perturbations (growth rates $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$) even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\mu$. They are called resonant drag instabilities. We focus on the acoustic resonant drag instability, which is potentially important in AGB star outflows, around supernova remnants and star clusters in starburst galaxies. We study the acoustic resonant drag instability, taking into account a continuous spectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether it survives in the polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the monodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid for the acoustic drag instability, focusing on small dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the fast-growing perturbations $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$ of the monodisperse limit into slower growing perturbations $\propto \mu$ due to the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the resonance. Furthermore, the large wave numbers that grow fastest in the monodisperse regime are stabilized by a size distribution, severely limiting the growth rates in the polydisperse regime. The acoustic resonant drag instability turns from a singularly perturbed problem in $\mu$ in the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation for a sufficiently wide size distribution. It can still grow exponentially in the polydisperse regime, but at a slower pace compared to the single size case.</description>

      <title>ALMAGAL I. The ALMA evolutionary study of high-mass protocluster formation in the Galaxy. Presentation of the survey and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental questions about the physics responsible for fragmenting molecular parsec-scale clumps into cores of ~1000 au are still open, that only a statistically significant investigation with ALMA is able to address: what are the dominant agents that determine the core demographics, mass, and spatial distribution as a function of the physical properties of the hosting clumps, their evolutionary stage and the different Galactic environments in which they reside? To what extent extent is fragmentation driven by clumps dynamics or mass transport in filaments? With ALMAGAL we observed the 1.38 mm continuum and lines toward more than 1000 dense clumps in our Galaxy, with M&gt;500M_sun, surface density &gt; 0.1 g/cm2 and d&lt;7.5 kpc. The ACA and two 12-m array setups were used to deliver a minimum resolution of ~1000 au over the entire sample distance range. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) to HII regions from the tip of the Galactic bar to the outskirts of the Galaxy. The spectral setup includes several molecular lines to trace the multiscale physics and dynamics of gas, notably CH3CN, H2CO, SiO, CH3OH, DCN, HC3N, SO etc. We present an initial overview of the observations and the early science product and results, with a first characterization of the morphological properties of the continuum emission. We use "perimeter-versus-area" and convex hull-versus-area metrics to classify the different morphologies. More extended and morphologically complex shapes are found toward clumps that are relatively more evolved and have higher surface densities.</description>

      <title>ALMAGAL II. The ALMA evolutionary study of high-mass protocluster formation in the Galaxy. ALMA data processing and pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05559</link>

Abstract: The ALMAGAL Large Program has observed 1017 high-mass star-forming regions distributed throughout the Galaxy, sampling different evolutionary stages and environmental conditions. In this work, we present the acquisition and processing of the ALMAGAL data. The main goal is to set up a robust pipeline that generates science-ready products, with a good and uniform quality across the whole sample. ALMAGAL observations were performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Each field was observed in three different telescope arrays, being sensitive to spatial scales ranging from 1000 au up to 0.1 pc. The spectral setup allows sensitive imaging of the continuum emission at 219 GHz, and it covers multiple molecular spectral lines observed in four different spectral windows that span about 4 GHz in frequency coverage. We have designed a Python-based processing workflow to calibrate and image these observational data. This ALMAGAL pipeline includes an improved continuum determination, suited for line-rich sources; an automatic self-calibration process that improves the dynamical range of the final images; and the combination of data from different telescope arrays to produce science-ready, fully combined images. The fully combined products have spatial resolutions in the range 800-2000 au, and mass sensitivities in the range 0.02-0.07 Mo. We also present a first analysis of the spectral line information included in the ALMAGAL setup, and its potential for future scientific studies. As an example, specific spectral lines at 1000 au scales resolve the presence of multiple outflows in clusters and will help us to search for disk candidates around massive protostars. Moreover, the broad frequency bands provide information on the chemical richness of the different cluster members, which can be used to study the chemical evolution during the formation process of star clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Gaia DR3 we derive new distances and luminosities for a sample of Galactic B supergiants which were thought to be post main-sequence (MS) objects from their HR diagram location beyond the terminal-age MS (TAMS). When applying the newer Gaia distances in addition to enhanced amounts of core-boundary mixing, aka convective overshooting, we show that these Galactic B supergiants are likely enclosed within the MS band, indicating an evolutionary stage of steady core hydrogen burning. We discuss the importance of considering enhanced overshooting and how vectors in the mass-luminosity plane (ML-plane) can be used to disentangle the effects of wind mass loss from interior mixing. We finish with the key message that any proposed solution to the BSG problem should consider not only an explanation for the sheer number of B supergiants inside the Hertzsprung gap, but should at the same time also account for the steep drop in rotation rates identified at spectral type B1 -- corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim$21 kK, and for which two distinct families of solutions have been proposed.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spectroscopy for Precessing Binary Black Hole Coalescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectroscopic study of black hole quasinormal modes in gravitational-wave ringdown observations is hindered by our ignorance of which modes should dominate astrophysical signals for different binary configurations, limiting tests of general relativity and astrophysics. In this work, we present a description of the quasinormal modes that are excited in the ringdowns of comparable mass, quasi-circular precessing binary black hole coalescences -- a key region of parameter space that has yet to be fully explored within the framework of black hole spectroscopy. We suggest that the remnant perturbation for precessing and non-precessing systems is approximately the same up to a rotation, which implies that the relative amplitudes of the quasinormal modes in both systems are also related by a rotation. We present evidence for this by analyzing an extensive catalog of numerical relativity simulations. Additional structure in the amplitudes is connected to the system's kick velocity and other asymmetries in the orbital dynamics. We find that the ringdowns of precessing systems need not be dominated by the ${(\ell,m)=(2,\pm 2)}$ quasinormal modes, and that instead the $(2,\pm 1)$~or~$(2,0)$ quasinormal modes can dominate. Our results are consistent with a ringdown analysis of the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave signal GW190521, and may also help in understanding phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model systematics.</description>

      <title>Induced three-neutron interactions with low cutoffs for dilute neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of dilute neutron matter are mostly determined by the s-wave two-body (2N) interaction, while three-body (3N) interactions are suppressed by the Pauli principle. In a previous work, we showed that it can be advantageous to use renormalization group based effective interactions with cutoffs scaled with the Fermi momentum, especially at low densities. In that case, induced 3N interactions may become important. In this work, we compute the 3N interaction induced by the similarity renormalization group flow of the s-wave 2N interaction. We work in the momentum-space hyperspherical partial wave basis and investigate its convergence properties. Then we study the effect of the induced 3N interaction on the equation of state of dilute neutron matter. We observe that the cutoff dependence of the equation of state is strongly reduced when the effect of induced 3N interaction is included.</description>
