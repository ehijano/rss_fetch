      <title>Triangular lattice models of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid from coupled wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral spin liquids (CSLs) are exotic phases of interacting spins in two dimensions, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractional excitations. We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven towards the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a four-fold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground state degeneracies, fractional quasi-particles, non-vanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial Pressure Effects, Phase Diagram, and Tricritical Point in the Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Lattice Magnet GdRu$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic phase diagram, magnetoelastic coupling, and uniaxial pressure effects of centrosymmetric magnetic skyrmion-hosting GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ are investigated by means of high-resolution capacitance dilatometry in fields up to 15\,T supported by specific heat and magnetisation studies. In addition to the previously reported phases in the $H$-$T$ phase diagram, we observe a third antiferromagnetic phase in zero magnetic field. We present the magnetic phase diagram and find two unreported phases, one of which features a comparably giant uniaxial pressure dependence. Our dilatometric measurements show magnetoelastic effects associated with the various magnetic ordering phenomena. We determine the uniaxial pressure dependencies of the various phases, in particular of the skyrmion lattice phase which is enhanced at higher fields and temperatures and also widens at a rate of 0.07~T/GPa when uniaxial pressure is applied along the $c$ axis. The relevance of fluctuations is further highlighted by the presence of tricritical point indicated by our thermodynamic data at the phase boundary separating two double-\textit{Q} magnetic configurations between which the skyrmion pocket phase evolves upon further cooling.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-driven topological Hall effect in room-temperature itinerant helimagnet Fe3Ga4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect (THE) is a hallmark of a non-trivial geometric spin arrangement in a magnetic metal, originating from a finite scalar spin chirality (SSC). The associated Berry phase is often a consequence of non-coplanar magnetic structures identified by multiple k-vectors. For single-k magnetic structures however with zero SSC, the emergence of a finite topological Hall signal presents a conceptual challenge. Here, we report that a fluctuation-driven mechanism involving chiral magnons is responsible for the observed THE in a low-symmetry compound, monoclinic Fe3Ga4. Through neutron scattering experiments, we discovered several nontrivial magnetic phases in this system. In our focus is the helical spiral phase at room temperature, which transforms into a transverse conical state in applied magnetic field, supporting a significant THE signal up to and above room temperature. Our work offers a fresh perspective in the search for novel materials with intertwined topological magnetic and transport properties.</description>

      <title>Accurate Simulation of the Hubbard Model with Finite Fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of finite-size fermionic projected entangled pair states, in conjunction with variational Monte Carlo, to perform accurate simulations of the ground-state of the 2D Hubbard model. Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.</description>

      <title>Finite-rate quench in disordered Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum quench of finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law scaling with the quench rate, consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. However, anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior is observed in disordered Kane-Mele model, which we attribute to the existence of a disorder-induced gapless region. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution, which exhibits similar dependence on the quench rate as the excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models. This similarity still holds in the bulk of the system even when we consider realistic open boundary conditions, facilitating the experimental characterization of the dynamic features in these models.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study on pressure-induced valence instability of CeCoSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth compounds RCoSi exhibit unique properties, with distinct structural behaviors depending on whether R is a light, middle or heavy rare-earth element. Among them, CeCoSi undergoes a structural phase transition under high pressure, with the phase transition pressure increasing as temperature rises. Some experimental studies suggest that the transition is closely related to the behavior of Ce-4f electrons. In this work, we systematically studied the evolution of the electronic structure of CeCoSi with temperature and pressure. First, we used the DFT+DMFT to calculate the energy-volume curve of CeCoSi, which was in good agreement with the experimental results and far superior to the DFT method. Next, we studied the electronic structure of CeCoSi under different pressures and temperatures using DFT+DMFT. Our results show that CeCoSi is a Kondo metal with hybridization of Ce-4f and Co-3d. As pressure increases, the renormalization factor Z of Ce-4f5/2 increases, the occupancy number of Ce-4f electrons decreases, and CeCoSi transitions to a mixed-valence state at ~5.5 GPa in 100 K. The pressure of the quantum phase transition PQ is slightly higher than the experimentally observed structural phase transition pressure PS, and the PQ increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior of PS in experiment. In addition, the hybridization strength of Ce-4f in the mixed-valence state is significantly greater than in the Kondo metal state. Our results suggest that the valence instability of Ce-4f is the cause of the structural phase transition. As pressure increases, Ce-4f electrons delocalize and CeCoSi transitions to mixed-valence state. This valence instability may cause redistribution of electron density, thus inducing a structural phase transition. Our work reveals the cause of the structural phase transition of CeCoSi under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Bound states of quasiparticles with quartic dispersion in an external potential: WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin semiclassical method is formulated for quasiparticles with quartic-in-momentum dispersion which presents the simplest case of a soft energy-momentum dispersion. It is shown that matching wave functions in the classically forbidden and allowed regions requires the consideration of higher-order Airy-type functions. The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. These hyperasymptotics are crucially important for the correct matching of wave functions in vicinity of turning points for higher-order differential equations. A quantization condition for bound state energies is obtained, which generalizes the standard Bohr-Sommerfeld condition for particles with quadratic energy-momentum dispersion and contains nonperturbative in $\hbar$ correction. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials.</description>

      <title>Local and Non-local Entanglement Witnesses of Fermi Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest both in utilizing entanglement means to characterize many-body systems and in uncovering their entanglement depth. Motivated by recent findings that the spin quantum Fisher information witnesses amplified multipartite entanglement of strange metals and characterizes their loss of quasiparticles, we study the quantum Fisher information in various cases of Fermi liquid. We show that local operators generically do not witness any multipartite entanglement in a Fermi liquid, but non-local many-body operators do. Our results point to novel experimental means to detect the entanglement depth of metallic fermionic systems and, in general, open a new avenue to the emerging exploration of entanglement in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Extended $s$-wave pairing from an emergent Feshbach resonanc in bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates, unraveling the pairing mechanism of charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets has been a long-standing challenge. Motivated by the discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in nickelate bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO), we study a minimal mixed dimensional (MixD) $t-J$ model supplemented with a repulsive Coulomb interaction $V$. When hole-doped, previous numerical simulations revealed that the system exhibits strong binding energies, with a phenomenology resembling a BCS-to-BEC crossover accompanied by a Feshbach resonance between two distinct types of charge carriers. Here, we perform a mean-field analysis that enables a direct observation of the BCS-to-BEC crossover as well as microscopic insights into the crossover region and the pairing symmetry for two-dimensional bilayers. We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing it to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one dimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the two-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a BCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the pairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin. Our analysis hence gives insights into pairing in unconventional superconductors and, further, can be tested in currently available ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, both $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ QAH states have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG) arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism, driven by the interplay between trigonal warping and staggered layer order under an applied displacement field. Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands into a central touching point and three "leg" Dirac cones. In the presence of staggered layer order, this splitting enables mass inversions driven by the displacement field to occur asynchronously at the central touching point and the "leg" Dirac cones, potentially leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal multilayer graphene systems, predicting the existence of additional QAH states beyond $C = \pm N, \pm 2N$ for $N$-layer graphene.</description>

      <title>Beyond Homes scaling: disorder, the Planckian bound and a new universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beginning with high-$T_c$ cuprate materials, it has been observed that many superconductors exhibit so-called "Homes scaling", in which the zero-temperature superfluid density, $\rho_{s0}$, is proportional to the product of the normal-state dc conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature, $\sigma_\mathrm{dc} T_c$. For conventional, s-wave superconductors, such scaling has been shown to be a natural consequence of elastic-scattering disorder, not only in the extreme dirty limit but across a broad range of scattering parameters. Here we show that when an analogous calculation is carried out for elastic scattering in d-wave superconductors, a stark contrast emerges, with $\rho_{s0} \propto \left(\sigma_\mathrm{dc} T_c \right)^2$ in the dirty limit, in apparent violation of Homes scaling. Within a simple approximate Migdal--Eliashberg treatment of inelastic scattering, we show how Homes scaling is recovered. The normal-state behavior of near optimally doped cuprates is dominated by inelastic scattering, but significant deviations from Homes scaling occur for disorder-dominated cuprate systems, such as underdoped YBCO and overdoped LSCO, and in very clean materials with little inelastic scattering, such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We present a revised analysis where both axes of the original Homes scaling plot are normalized by the Drude plasma weight, $\omega_{p,D}^2$, and show that new universal scaling emerges, in which the superfluid fractions of dirty s-wave and dirty d-wave superconductors coalesce to a single point at which normal-state scattering is occurring at the Planckian bound. The combined result is a new tool for classifying superconductors in terms of order parameter symmetry, as well as scattering strength and character. Although our model starts from a Fermi-liquid assumption it describes underdoped cuprates surprisingly well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus in terms of the representation of $GL(2,\bZ)$. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to unoriented surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we can assign Hilbert spaces with integer dimensions to unoriented surfaces in the case of abelian bosonic topological systems with time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional, phonon-mediated superconductors, the transition temperature $T_c$ and normal-state scattering rate $1/\tau$ - deduced from the linear-in-temperature resistivity $\rho(T)$ - are linked through the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda_{\rm ph}$. In cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, no equivalent $\lambda$ has yet been identified, despite the fact that at high doping, $\alpha$ - the low-$T$ $T$-linear coefficient of $\rho(T)$ - also scales with $T_c$. Here, we use dc resistivity and high-field magnetoresistance to extract $\tau^{-1}$ in electron-doped La$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (LCCO) as a function of $x$ from optimal doping to beyond the superconducting dome. A highly anisotropic inelastic component to $\tau^{-1}$ is revealed whose magnitude diminishes markedly across the doping series. Using known Fermi surface parameters and subsequent modelling of the Hall coefficient, we demonstrate that the form of $\tau^{-1}$ in LCCO is consistent with scattering off commensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations of variable strength $\lambda_{\rm sf}$. The clear correlation between $\alpha$, $\lambda_{\rm sf}$ and $T_c$ then identifies low-energy spin-fluctuations as the primary pairing glue in electron-doped cuprates. The contrasting magnetotransport behaviour in hole-doped cuprates suggests that the higher $T_c$ in the latter cannot be attributed solely to an increase in $\lambda_{\rm sf}$. Indeed, the success in modelling LCCO serves to reinforces the notion that resolving the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped cuprates may require more than a simple extension of BCS theory.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its Mott and antiferromagnetic behavior, as it undergoes a metal-insulator transition near a band edge. By analyzing spatial correlations of the local density of states (LDOS) with scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge and determine its critical exponent as nu = 0.75 +/- 0.1. Our findings show that both LDOS distribution functions and multifractal spectra obey two exact symmetry relations based on the Weyl group symmetry of nonlinear sigma-models. These symmetries hold across the entire transition, from extended to strongly localized states, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Additionally, we observe a power-law scaling of LDOS fluctuations close to the band edge (power -1.7), deep in the localized regime. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate that breaking time-reversal symmetry significantly improves the agreement between our experimental data and theory compared to the standard Anderson model. Overall, our results provide a unifying framework for understanding localization at the band gap edge of a strongly correlated 2D material and show how localization patterns reflect the symmetry class of disordered electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Holographic central charge for double scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the holographic central charge ($c_{sDG}$) associated with sine dilaton gravity in the semiclassical limit. Following the standard holographic folklore, this should correspond to the central charge associated with a $q$ Schwarzian quantum mechanical model in the double scaling limit. In the low energy limit, the gravity description flows into the ordinary JT gravity which is a conjectured dual of ordinary Schwarzian quantum mechanics at strong coupling. We compute the associated central charge ($c_{JT}$), which reveals $c_{sDG}&gt;c_{JT}$. We identify this as an artifact of the UV completion of JT gravity in terms of sine dilaton gravity.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by exploring doped multi-orbital antiferromagnets (AFMs) and altermagnets (ALMs) we explore minimal $t$-$J$ models on the square-octagon lattice which favor such collinear magnetic orders in the regime where spin exchange dominates. While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</description>

Abstract: A recent experiment observes a series of quantum spin Hall effects in transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e MoTe$_2$ [K. Kang, et. al, Nature 628, 522-526 (2024)]. Among them, the vanishing Hall signal at the filling factor $\nu=3$ implies a possible realization of a time-reversal pair of the even-denominator fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Inspired by this discovery, we investigate whether a robust incompressible quantum Hall liquid can be stabilized in the half-filled Chern band of twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We use the continuum model with parameters relevant to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers and obtain three consecutive nearly flat Chern bands with the same Chern number. Crucially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled,signatures of non-Abelian frctional quantum Hall state are found via exact diagonalization calculations, including the stable six-fold ground state degeneracy that grows more robust with the lattice size and is consistent with an even-denominator FCI state. We further perform flux insertion simulations to reveal a 1/2 quantized many-body Chern number as direct evidence of topological order. Furthermore, the ground state density structure factors show no sharp peak, indicating no charge density wave order. These evidences signal the potential of realizing the non-Abelian state at zero magnetic field in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at the fractional hole filling 3/2.</description>

      <title>Origin of the density wave instability in trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ revealed by optical and ultrafast spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the intricate phase diagram of unconventional superconductors characterized by intertwined electronic orders and superconductivity, a key step in understanding the superconducting mechanism is to investigate the parent compounds from which superconductivity emerges through doping or pressure. In this study, we employed optical spectroscopy and ultrafast reflectivity measurements to examine the density wave instability in the trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which displays pressure-induced superconductivity up to 30 K. Our optical spectroscopy measurements reveal that La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ behaves as a metal with a high plasma frequency. Upon cooling, we observed a distinct formation of a density wave energy gap in both optical conductivity and pump-probe measurements. The gap feature is more pronounced compared to the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparison of the experimentally determined plasma frequency with first-principles calculations, we classify La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ as a moderately electron-correlated material, resembling the parent compound of iron-based superconductors but exhibiting weaker correlation than the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. The enhanced gap feature and weaker electronic correlation in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ may explain its lower superconductivity transition temperature under high pressure. These findings significantly advance our comprehension of the density wave and superconductivity mechanisms in the trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.</description>

Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.</description>

      <title>Single-boson exchange formulation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and its application to the functional renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

Abstract: Ultrafast-light-driven strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulators, such as prototypical NiO with large energy gap 4 eV, have recently attracted experimental attention using either above-gap [K. Gillmeister et al., Nat. Commun. 11, 4095 (2020)] or subgap [H. Qiu et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 388 (2021)] energy photons that are of fundamental interest in far-from-equilibrium quantum matter or spintronic applications, respectively. In the latter context, emission of THz radiation is also observed from NiO/Pt bilayers, where heavy metal (HM) Pt introduces strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, microscopic mechanisms of such emission remain obscure because spintronic THz emitters have been amply studied using FM/HM (FM-ferromagnetic metal of conventional type) bilayers, where ultrafast demagnetization takes place and is directly related to THz emission. Conversely, in NiO total magnetization is zero prior to the fs laser pulse (fsLP) application. Here we employ the two-orbital Hubbard-Hund-Heisenberg model and study, via numerically exact nonequilibrium quantum many-body methods, the dynamics of its Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization. Additionally, we compute electromagnetic radiation by both time-dependent magnetization and local charge currents arising in either plain NiO or NiO with proximity SOC introduced by HM layer. Our analysis reveals nonclassical dynamics of Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization, changing only in length while not rotating, where the former is substantially reduced only in the case above-gap fsLP. In the plain NiO case, THz radiation of interest to applications is insignificant, but adding SOC enhances both current and magnetic dipole contributions to it. Above THz range, we find integer high-harmonic generation, as well as unusual noninteger harmonics for above-gap fsLP pump.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological heavy fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene is a framework for treating its strongly interacting topological flat bands. In this work, we employ the THF model with heterostrain and particle-hole symmetry breaking corrections to study its symmetry-broken ground states. We find that the heterostrain correction motivates a specific parent-state wavefunction which dictates the presence or absence of an incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) at each integer filling by invoking Dirac node braiding and annihilation as a mechanism to achieve low energy gapped states. We then show that one-shot Hartree-Fock faithfully replicates the numerical results of fully self-consistent states and motivates an analytical approximation for the IKS wavevector. We can also account for the particle-hole asymmetry in the correlated insulator gaps. In particular, the THF model predicts stronger correlated states on the electron side rather than hole side in agreement with magic angle experiments, despite the electron side being more dispersive in the single-particle band structure. This work demonstrates that we can analytically explain even the more subtle symmetry breaking order properties observed in experiments where heterostrain, relaxation, and interactions together determine the ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Residual entropy, which reflects the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is crucial for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task owing to computational limitations. In this Letter, we introduce the temperature incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our approach to overcoming these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have rogorously tested TIMC on several complex systems, including the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These challenges arise from singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability to calculate residual entropy could provide insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group Analysis of $O(3)$ Nonlinear Sigma Model and Non-Abelian Bosonization Duality</title>

Abstract: It is known that the $U(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model is dual to the free fermion theory in two dimensions via non-Abelian bosonization. While it is decomposed into the $SU(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and a free compact boson, the former is believed to be equivalent to the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term at $\theta=\pi$. In this work, we reexamine this duality through the lens of non-perturbative renormalization group (RG) flow. We analyze the RG flow structure of the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term in two dimensions using the functional renormalization group. Our results reveal a nontrivial fixed point with a nonzero value of the topological coupling. The scaling dimensions (critical exponents) at this fixed point suggest the realization of a duality between the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term and the free fermion theory, indicating that these models belong to the same universality class.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Latent Haldane Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent symmetries, which materialize after performing isospectral reductions, have recently been shown to be instrumental in revealing novel topological phases in one-dimensional systems, among many other applications. In this work, we explore how to construct a family of seemingly complicated two-dimensional models that result in energy-dependent Haldane models upon performing an isospectral reduction. In these models, we find energy-dependent latent Semenoff masses without introducing a staggered on-site potential. In addition, energy-dependent latent Haldane masses also emerge in decorated lattices with nearest-neighbor complex hoppings. Using the Haldane model's properties, we then predict the location of the topological gaps in the aforementioned family of models and construct phase diagrams to determine where the topological phases lie in parameter space. This idea yielded, for instance, useful insights in the case of a modified version of $\alpha$-graphyne and hexagonal plaquettes with additional decorations, where the gap-closing energies can be calculated using the ISR to predict topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Possibility of BCS-BEC crossover in $\kappa$-type organic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of BCS-BEC crossover in superconductors, which smoothly connects Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in fermion systems, is an intriguing recent topic in strongly correlated electron systems. The organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$ ($\kappa$-HgBr) under pressure is one of the leading candidates, owing to its unique metallic spin-liquid nature and tunable electron correlation. We theoretically investigate the extended Hubbard model for $\kappa$-HgBr and discuss the possibility of the BCS-BEC crossover by systematically calculating superconducting correlation function, coherence length, superfluid weight, and chemical potential. Our findings show that the BCS-BEC crossover can be observed when competing phases, such as Mott insulators and charge and/or spin orders, are suppressed by appropriate hole doping. $\kappa$-HgBr is just the case because both the Mott insulating phase and magnetic orders are absent due to its nonstoichiometric Hg composition and geometrical frustration. We further propose that other $\kappa$-type organic superconductors could serve as potential candidates of the BCS-BEC crossover if their band fillings and degree of geometrical frustration are systematically tuned.</description>

      <title>Fortuity in SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes.
  We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.</description>
