      <title>Evaluating Local Policies in Centralized Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a policy evaluation problem in centralized markets. We show that the aggregate impact of any marginal reform, the Marginal Policy Effect (MPE), is nonparametrically identified using data from a baseline equilibrium, without additional variation in the policy rule. We achieve this by constructing the equilibrium-adjusted outcome: a policy-invariant structural object that augments an agent's outcome with the full equilibrium externality their participation imposes on others. We show that these externalities can be constructed using estimands that are already common in empirical work. The MPE is identified as the covariance between our structural outcome and the reform's direction, providing a flexible tool for optimal policy targeting and a novel bridge to the Marginal Treatment Effects literature.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning and Consumption-Savings Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how reinforcement learning can explain two puzzling empirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns. I develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation to make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from standard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key findings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low liquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs 0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with Ganong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment experiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling for current economic conditions, a "scarring" effect documented by Malmendier and Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about income risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism generates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through value function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation results closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive learning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for understanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond what current economic conditions would predict.</description>

      <title>Black Box Absorption: LLMs Undermining Innovative Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly adopted as critical tools for accelerating innovation. This paper identifies and formalizes a systemic risk inherent in this paradigm: \textbf{Black Box Absorption}. We define this as the process by which the opaque internal architectures of LLM platforms, often operated by large-scale service providers, can internalize, generalize, and repurpose novel concepts contributed by users during interaction. This mechanism threatens to undermine the foundational principles of innovation economics by creating severe informational and structural asymmetries between individual creators and platform operators, thereby jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of the innovation ecosystem. To analyze this challenge, we introduce two core concepts: the idea unit, representing the transportable functional logic of an innovation, and idea safety, a multidimensional standard for its protection. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of absorption and proposes a concrete governance and engineering agenda to mitigate these risks, ensuring that creator contributions remain traceable, controllable, and equitable.</description>
