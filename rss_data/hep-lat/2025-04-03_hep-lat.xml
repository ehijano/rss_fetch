      <title>$T_{cc}$ from finite volume energy levels: the left-hand cut problem and its solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice QCD has become a crucial tool for studying hadron-hadron interactions from first principles. However, significant challenges arise when extracting infinite-volume scattering parameters from finite-volume energy levels using the conventional L\"uscher method, particularly due to the presence of left-hand cuts induced by long-range interactions such as the one-pion exchange. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that combines chiral effective field theory and the plane-wave expansion with the Hamiltonian approach. By solving a Schr\"odinger-like equation in a finite volume, this method establishes a connection between finite-volume energy spectra and infinite-volume physical quantities, while effectively handling issues caused by left-hand cuts. Furthermore, the adoption of a plane-wave basis helps mitigating complexities associated with partial-wave mixing. Our preliminary numerical results at $m_\pi \approx 280$ MeV confirm that this approach efficiently overcomes the shortcomings of the L\"uscher method and indicate a resonant interpretation of the $T_{cc}(3875)$ state--in contrast to the virtual state suggested in conventional analyses.</description>

      <title>The TELOS Collaboration Approach to Reproducibility and Open Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TELOS Collaboration is committed to producing and analysing lattice data reproducibly, and sharing its research openly. In this document, we set out the ways that we make this happen, where there is scope for improvement, and how we plan to achieve this. This is intended to work both as a statement of policy, and a guide to practice for those beginning to work with us. Some details and recommendations are specific to the context in which the Collaboration works (such as references to requirements imposed by funders in the United Kingdom); however, most recommendations may serve as a template for other collaborations looking to make their own work reproducible. Full tutorials on every aspect of reproducibility are beyond the scope of this document, but we refer to other resources for further information.</description>

      <title>A new 4D lattice QCD equation of state: extended density coverage from a generalized $T^\prime$-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new equation of state for QCD in which the temperature $T$ and the three chemical potentials for baryon number $\mu_B$, electric charge $\mu_Q$ and strangeness $\mu_S$ can be varied independently. This result is based on a generalization of the $T'$-expansion scheme, thanks to which the diagonal $\mu_B$ extrapolation was pushed up to a baryo-chemical potential $\mu_B/T \sim 3.5$ for the first time. This considerably extended the coverage of the Taylor expansion, limited to $\mu_B/T &lt; 2.5-3$. As a consequence, we are able to offer a substantially larger coverage of the four-dimensional QCD phase diagram as well, compared to previously available Taylor expansion results. Our results are based on new continuum estimated lattice results on the full set of second and fourth order fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Nucleon scattering from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from lattice QCD on baryon resonances and meson-baryon, baryon-baryon scattering are presented. Such scattering processes and resonances can be determined in lattice QCD by first obtaining the finite-volume energy spectrum of stationary states involving meson-baryon and baryon-baryon systems. A well-known quantization condition involving the scattering $K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the best fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those which produce a finite-volume spectrum which best matches that obtained from lattice QCD. The $\Delta$ resonance, a recent study of the two-pole nature of scattering near the $\Lambda(1405)$, and $NN$ scattering in the $SU(3)$ flavor limit are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Towards the determination of CP-odd pion-nucleon couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleon matrix elements (NMEs) associated with quark chromo-magnetic dipole moments (cMDMs) play a crucial role in determining the CP-odd pion-nucleon couplings induced by quark chromo-electric dipole moments. In recent years, it has been argued that the NMEs of cMDMs can be related to the third moment of the nucleon's higher-twist (specifically, twist-three) parton distribution function (PDF) $e(x)$, which can, in principle, be measured through dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes. By applying the spin-flavor expansion to the cMDM operators in the large-$N_c$ limit, where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors, we show that the NMEs receive contributions not only from the twist-three PDF $e(x)$ but also from an additional, previously neglected nucleon form factor. Incorporating constraints from the spin-flavor expansion, recent experimental data on $e(x)$, as well as model calculations of $e(x)$, we estimate the NMEs of the cMDM operators. Our analysis indicates that the NMEs are dominated by the nucleon form factors, and the cMDM contributions to pion-nucleon couplings can be comparable to those from the quark sigma terms.</description>

      <title>Pion Gravitational Form Factors in Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the momentum-transfer dependence of the pion gravitational form factors (GFFs) within a top-down holographic QCD framework. These form factors encode essential information about the internal stress distribution of hadrons and may serve as a tool to explore the non-perturbatice dyanmics responsible for quark and gluon confinement in QCD. In particular, we evaluate the forward-limit value of the GFFs, known as the D-term, within the framework of the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Our analysis also reveals glueball dominance, wherein the pion's gravitational interaction is mediated by an infinite tower of glueball excitations.</description>

      <title>The impact of glasma on heavy quark spectra and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the glasma classical color fields, produced in the very early stage of heavy-ion collisions, on the transport of heavy quarks. The glasma fields evolve according to the classical Yang-Mills equations, while the dynamics of heavy quarks is described by Wong's equations. We numerically solve these equations and compute the transport coefficient $\kappa$, which is anisotropic and initially very large. Further, we extract observables sensitive to the initial glasma stage. The heavy quark nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is affected by the glasma but the effect is moderate compared to the nPDF contribution. Our main finding is that the glasma has a large impact on the azimuthal correlation between $Q\overline{Q}$ pairs, initially produced back-to-back.</description>

      <title>Fully ergodic simulations using radial updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sensible application of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is often hindered by the presence of large - or even infinite - potential barriers. These potential barriers separate the configuration space into distinct sectors and can lead to ergodicity violations that bias measurements. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting HMC with a multiplicative Metropolis-Hastings update in a so-called ''radial direction'' of the fields which enables crossing the potential barriers and ensures ergodicity of the sampling algorithm at comparably low computational cost. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simple toy model and show how it can be applied to the fermionic Hubbard model describing physics ranging from an exactly-solvable two-site system to the $C_{20}H_{12}$ perylene molecule. Our numerical results show that the radial updates successfully remove ergodicity violations, while simultaneously reducing autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}}$ helicity amplitudes and transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently reported new results on the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition form factors using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within a coupled formalism based on the Dyson-Schwinger, Bethe-Salpeter, and Faddeev equations. In this work, we extend our investigation to the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition. Our computed transition form factors show reasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities. However, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a sharper variation than theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is expected, as these continuum QCD analyses account only for the quark-core of baryons, while low photon virtualities are dominated by meson cloud effects. We anticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI framework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and QCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and the contributions of scalar and vector diquarks.</description>

      <title>Topological Feature of Real-time Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are numerous methods to characterize topology and its boundary zero modes, yet their statistical mechanical properties have not received as much attention as other approaches. Here, we investigate the Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics of topological models, revealing that boundary zero modes can be described by an overlooked real-time Fisher zero pairing effect. This effect is validated in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain model, with the latter exhibiting a Fisher zero braiding picture. Topological zero modes exhibit robustness even when non-Hermiticity is introduced into the system and display characteristics of imaginary-time crystals when the energy eigenvalues are complex. We further examine the real-time Fisher zeros of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, which maps to the Kitaev chain. We present a fractal picture of the Fisher zeros, illustrating how interactions eliminate topology. The mechanism of zero-pairing provides a natural statistical mechanical approach to understanding the connection between topology and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in high-temperature lattice QCD with (u, d, s, c, b) optimal domain-wall quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial $ z $-correlators of meson operators in $ N_f=2+1+1+1 $ lattice QCD with optimal domain-wall quarks across eight temperatures ranging from 325 to 3250 MeV. The meson operators include a complete set of Dirac bilinears for ten flavor combinations. Our findings reveal a hierarchical restoration of chiral symmetry in QCD with $ (u, d, s, c, b) $ quarks, progressing sequentially from $ SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_A $ to $ SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R \times U(1)_A $, then to $ SU(4)_L \times SU(4)_R \times U(1)_A $, and finally to $ SU(5)_L \times SU(5)_R \times U(1)_A $ as the temperature increases. Additionally, we explore the emergence of the $ SU(2)_{CS} $ chiral-spin symmetry and compare the temperature windows for all flavor combinations. Our results indicate that the temperature windows for the emergent $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry are primarily dominated by the $ \bar{u} b $ and $ \bar{s} b $ sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous studies [1, 2], we confirmed that a quantum annealer can be used for importance sampling of gauge theories. In this paper, we extend the previous results to larger 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional lattices to generate ensembles for U(3) gauge theory in the strong coupling limit. We make use of the D-Wave quantum annealer to generate histograms for sub-lattices, and use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to determine thermodynamic observables and their dependence on the physical parameters on large volumes. We benchmark our results to those obtained from classical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quantum Yang--Mills at finite temperature beyond lattice: a Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Dyson--Schwinger approach, we perform an analysis of the non-trivial ground state of thermal $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory in the non-perturbative regime where chiral symmetry is dynamically broken by a mass gap. Basic thermodynamic observables such as energy density and pressure are derived analytically, using Jacobi elliptic functions. The results are compared with lattice results. Good agreement is found at low temperatures, providing a viable scenario of a gas of massive glue states populating higher levels of the spectrum of the theory. At high temperatures a scenario without glue states consistent with a massive scalar field is observed, showing an interesting agreement with lattice data. The possibility is discussed that the results derived in this analysis open up a novel pathway beyond lattice to precision studies of phase transitions with false vacuum and cosmological relics that depend on the equations of state in strong coupled gauge theories of the type of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit correlation and spatial distributions for spin-0 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor.</description>
