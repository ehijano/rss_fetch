      <title>Introduction to Quantum Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a topos of quantum sets and embed into it the classical topos of sets. We show that the internal logic of the topos of sets, when interpreted in the topos of quantum sets, provides the Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum propositional calculus of idempotents in a canonical internal commutative algebra of the topos of quantum sets. We extend this construction by allowing the quantum counterpart of Boolean algebras of classical truth values which we introduce and study in detail. We realize expected values of observables in quantum states in our topos of quantum sets as a tautological morphism from the canonical internal commutative algebra to a canonical internal object of affine functions on quantum states. We show also that in our topos of quantum sets one can speak about quantum quivers in the sense of Day-Street and Chikhladze. Finally, we provide a categorical derivation of the Leavitt path algebra of such a quantum quiver and relate it to the category of stable representations of the quiver. It is based on a categorification of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra in the context of functor adjunctions replacing the customary use of Hilbert modules.</description>

      <title>Non-Hausdorff manifolds over locally ordered spaces via sheaf theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locally ordered spaces can be used as topological models of concurrent programs: in that setting, the local order models the irreversibility of time during execution. Under certain conditions, one can even work with locally ordered manifolds: we build the universal euclidean local order over every locally ordered space (in categorical terms, the subcategory of euclidean local orders is coreflective in the category of locally ordered spaces), and give conditions to ensure that it preserves the execution traces of the corresponding program. To this end, we apply a well-known construction which relates sheaves on a space and \'etale bundles over this space. This is a far reaching generalization of a result about realizations of graph products. We particularize the construction to locally ordered realization of precubical sets, and show that it admits a purely combinatorial description. With the same proof techniques, we show that, unlike for the topological realization, there is a unique precubical set whose locally ordered realization is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Domains and Classifying Topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a new connection between synthetic domain theory and Grothendieck topoi related to the distributive lattice classifier. In particular, all the axioms of synthetic domain theory (including the inductive fixed point object and the chain completeness of the dominance) emanate from a countable version of the synthetic quasi-coherence principle that has emerged as a central feature in the unification of synthetic algebraic geometry, synthetic Stone duality, and synthetic category theory. The duality between quasi-coherent algebras and affine spaces in a topos with a distributive lattice object provides a new set of techniques for reasoning synthetically about domain-like structures, and reveals a broad class of (higher) sheaf models for synthetic domain theory.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Quillen's D\'evissage theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a different proof of Quillen's D\'evissage theorem using Barwick's theorem of the heart. The key ingredient is a certain short exact sequence of dg categories, which is closely related with the Auslander-type construction for nilpotent extensions which was used in the papers of Kuznetsov-Lunts \cite{KL15}, Land-Tamme \cite{LT19} and the author \cite{E20}.</description>

      <title>Surface Diagrams for Frobenius Algebras and Frobenius-Schur Indicators in Grothendieck-Verdier Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grothendieck-Verdier categories (also known as $\ast$-autonomous categories) generalize rigid monoidal categories, with notable representation-theoretic examples including categories of bimodules, modules over Hopf algebroids, and modules over vertex operator algebras.
  In this paper, we develop a surface-diagrammatic calculus for Grothendieck-Verdier categories, extending the string-diagrammatic calculus of Joyal and Street for rigid monoidal categories into a third dimension. This extension naturally arises from the non-invertibility of coherence data in Grothendieck-Verdier categories.
  We show that key properties of Frobenius algebras in rigid monoidal categories carry over to the Grothendieck-Verdier setting. Moreover, we introduce higher Frobenius-Schur indicators for suitably finite $k$-linear pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories and prove their invariance under pivotal Frobenius linearly distributive equivalences.
  The proofs are carried out using the surface-diagrammatic calculus. To facilitate the verification of some of our results, we provide auxiliary files for the graphical proof assistant homotopy$.$io.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Treatment of Open Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open stochastic system \`a la Jan Willems is a system affected by two qualitatively different kinds of uncertainty: one is probabilistic fluctuation, and the other one is nondeterminism caused by a fundamental lack of information. We present a formalization of open stochastic systems in the language of category theory. Central to this is the notion of copartiality which models how the lack of information propagates through a system (corresponding to the coarseness of sigma-algebras in Willems' work). As a concrete example, we study extended Gaussian distributions, which combine Gaussian probability with nondeterminism and correspond precisely to Willems' notion of Gaussian linear systems. We describe them both as measure-theoretic and abstract categorical entities, which enables us to rigorously describe a variety of phenomena like noisy physical laws and uninformative priors in Bayesian statistics. The category of extended Gaussian maps can be seen as a mutual generalization of Gaussian probability and linear relations, which connects the literature on categorical probability with ideas from control theory like signal-flow diagrams.</description>
