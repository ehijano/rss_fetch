      <title>Metastable Hierarchy in Abstract Low-Temperature Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we review the metastable hierarchy in low-temperature lattice models. In the first part, we state that for any abstract lattice system governed by a Hamiltonian potential and evolving according to a Metropolis-type dynamics, there exists a hierarchical decomposition of the collection of stable plateaux in the system into multiple $\mathfrak{m}$ levels, such that at each level there exist tunneling metastable transitions between the stable plateaux, which can be characterized by convergence to a simple Markov chain as the inverse temperature $\beta$ tends to infinity. In the second part, we collect several examples that realize this hierarchical structure of metastability. In order to fix the ideas, we select the Ising model as our lattice system and discuss its metastable behavior under four different types of dynamics, namely the Glauber dynamics with positive/zero external fields and the Kawasaki dynamics with few/many particles. This review article is submitted to the proceedings of the event PSPDE XII, held at the University of Trieste from September 9-13, 2024.</description>

      <title>The Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem for SPDEs in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a unified proof of the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem for various notions of solutions for SPDEs in Banach spaces with cylindrical Wiener noise. We use Kurtz' generalization of the theorems of Yamada, Watanabe and Engelbert. Moreover, we deduce the classical Yamada-Watanabe theorem for SPDEs, with a slightly different notion of 'unique strong solution' than that of Kurtz. Our setting includes analytically strong solutions, analytically weak solutions and mild solutions. For each of these notions, our approach allows a vast flexibility with regard to which function spaces and integrability conditions are chosen in the definition of a solution (and therefore changing the meaning of existence and uniqueness). All results hold in Banach spaces which are either martingale type 2 or UMD. For analytically weak solutions, the results hold in arbitrary Banach spaces. In particular, our results extend the Yamada-Watanabe theorems of Ondr\'ejat for mild solutions in 2-smooth Banach spaces, of R\"ockner et al. for the variational framework and of Kunze for analytically weak solutions, and cover many new settings. As a tool, and of interest itself, we construct a measurable representation I of the stochastic integral in a martingale type 2 or UMD Banach space, in the sense that for any stochastically integrable process f and cylindrical Brownian motion W, we have $I(f(\omega),W(\omega),\mathrm{Law}(f,W)) = (\int_0^{\cdot} f\, \mathrm{d}W)(\omega)$ for almost every $\omega$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic $(m,n)$-Parking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish new results on the probabilistic parking model (introduced by Durm\'ic, Han, Harris, Ribeiro, and Yin) with $m$ cars and $n$ parking spots and probability parameter $p\in[0,1]$. For any $ m \leq n$ and $p \in [0,1]$, we study the parking preference of the last car, denoted $a_m$, and determine the conditional distribution of $a_m$ and compute its expected value. We show that both formulas depict explicit dependence on the probability parameter $p$. We study the case where $m = cn $ for some $ 0 &lt; c &lt; 1 $ and investigate the asymptotic behavior and show that the presence of ``extra spots'' on the street significantly affects the rate at which the conditional distribution of $ a_m $ converges to the uniform distribution on $[n]$. Even for small $ \varepsilon = 1 - c $, an $ \varepsilon $-proportion of extra spots reduces the convergence rate from $ 1/\sqrt{n} $ to $ 1/n $ when $ p \neq 1/2 $. Additionally, we examine how the convergence rate depends on $c$, while keeping $n$ and $p$ fixed. We establish that as $c$ approaches zero, the total variation distance between the conditional distribution of $a_m$ and the uniform distribution on $[n]$ decreases at least linearly in $c$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multidimensional discontinuous backward stochastic differential equations in a filtration that supports both a Brownian motion and an independent integer-valued random measure. Under suitable $\mathbb{L}^p$-integrability conditions on the data, we establish the existence and uniqueness of $\mathbb{L}^p$-solutions for both cases: $p \geq 2$ and $p \in (1,2)$. The generator is assumed to be stochastically monotone in the state variable $y$, stochastically Lipschitz in the control variables $(z, u)$, and to satisfy a stochastic linear growth condition, along with an appropriate $\mathbb{L}^p$-integrability requirement.</description>

      <title>Potentials of skip-free Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential theory has important applications in various fields such as physics, finance, and biology. In this paper, we investigate the potentials of two classic types of discrete-time skip-free Markov chains: upward skip-free and downward skip-free Markov chains. The key to deriving these potentials lies in the use of truncation approximation techniques. The results are then applied to GI/M/1 queues and M/G/1 queues, and further extended to continuous-time skip-free Markov chains.</description>

      <title>The Limiting Spectral Distribution of Various Matrix Ensembles Under the Anticommutator Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the quantization of classical quantities and Rankin Selberg convolution, we study the anticommutator operation $\{\cdot, \cdot\}$, where $\{A,B\} = AB + BA$, applied to real symmetric random matrix ensembles including Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE), the palindromic Toeplitz ensemble (PTE), the $k$-checkerboard ensemble, and the block $k$-circulant ensemble ($k$-BCE). Using combinatorial and topological techniques related to non-crossing and free matching properties of GOE and PTE, we obtain closed-form formulae for the moments of the limiting spectral distributions of $\{$GOE, GOE$\}$, $\{$PTE, PTE$\}$, $\{$GOE, PTE$\}$ and establish the corresponding limiting spectral distributions with generating functions and convolution. On the other hand, $\{$GOE, $k$-checkerboard$\}$ and $\{$$k$-checkerboard, $j$-checkerboard$\}$ exhibit entirely different spectral behavior than the other anticommutator ensembles: while the spectrum of $\{$GOE, $k$-checkerboard$\}$ consists of 1 bulk regime of size $\Theta(N)$ and 1 blip regime of size $\Theta(N^{3/2})$, the spectrum of $\{$$k$-checkerboard, $j$-checkerboard$\}$ consists of 1 bulk regime of size $\Theta(N)$, 2 intermediary blip regimes of size $\Theta(N^{3/2})$, and 1 largest blip regime of size $\Theta(N^2)$. In both cases, with the appropriate weight function, we are able to isolate the largest regime fro other regime(s) and analyze its moments and convergence results via combinatorics. We end with numerical computation of lower even moments of $\{$GOE, $k$-BCE$\}$ and $\{$$k$-BCE, $k$-BCE$\}$ based on genus expansion and discussion on the challenge with analyzing the intermediary blip regimes of $\{$$k$-checkerboard, $j$-checkerboard$\}$.</description>

      <title>A Proof of The Changepoint Detection Threshold Conjecture in Preferential Attachment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of detecting and estimating a changepoint in the attachment function of a network evolving according to a preferential attachment model on $n$ vertices, using only a single final snapshot of the network. Bet et al.~\cite{bet2023detecting} show that a simple test based on thresholding the number of vertices with minimum degrees can detect the changepoint when the change occurs at time $n-\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. They further make the striking conjecture that detection becomes impossible for any test if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Kaddouri et al.~\cite{kaddouri2024impossibility} make a step forward by proving the detection is impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(n^{1/3}).$ In this paper, we resolve the conjecture affirmatively, proving that detection is indeed impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Furthermore, we establish that estimating the changepoint with an error smaller than $o(\sqrt{n})$ is also impossible, thereby confirming that the estimator proposed in Bhamidi et al.~\cite{bhamidi2018change} is order-optimal.</description>

      <title>Coupling hydrodynamics of several Facilitated Exclusion Processes with closed boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the hydrodynamic limit for the ergodic dynamics of the Facilitated Exclusion Process with closed boundaries in the symmetric, asymmetric and weakly asymmetric regimes. For this, we couple it with a Simple Exclusion Process by constructing a mapping that transforms the facilitated dynamics into the simple one. As the hydrodynamic behaviour of the simple exclusion process with closed boundaries has been extensively studied, we can deduce the corresponding hydrodynamics for the facilitated exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Almost sure central limit theorems via chaos expansions and related results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of integral functionals of stationary Gaussian random fields as the integration domain tends to be the whole space. More precisely, using the Wiener chaos expansion and Malliavin-Stein method, we establish an almost sure central limit theorem (ASCLT) only under mild conditions on the covariance function of the underlying stationary Gaussian field. In this setting, we additionally derive a quantitative central limit theorem with rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance, and show certain regularity property for the said integral functionals (the latter under weaker conditions). In particular, we solved an open question on the Malliavin differentiability of the excursion volume of Berry's random wave model. As a key consequence of our analysis, we obtain the exact asymptotic rate (as a function of the exponent) for moments of Bessel functions, thus confirming a conjecture based on existing numerical simulations. In the end, we provide two applications of our result: (i) ASCLT in the context of Breuer-Major central limit theorems, (ii) ASCLT for Berry's random wave model. It is worth stressing that our approach does not require any knowledge on the regularity properties of random variables (e.g., Malliavin differentiability) and hence not only complements the existing literature, but also leads to novel results that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Explicit positivity preserving numerical method for linear stochastic volatility models driven by $\alpha$-stable process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a linear stochastic volatility model driven by $\alpha$-stable processes, which admits a unique positive solution. To preserve positivity, we modify the classical forward Euler-Maruyama scheme and analyze its numerical properties. The scheme achieves a strong convergence order of $1/\alpha$. Numerical simulations are presented at the end to verify theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis for Mean-Field SDEs With Jump By Malliavin Calculus: Chaos Expansion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe an explicit extension formula in sensitivity analysis regarding the Malliavin weight for jump-diffusion mean-field stochastic differential equations whose local Lipschitz drift coefficients are influenced by the product of the solution and its law. We state that these extended equations have unique Malliavin differentiable solutions in Wiener-Poisson space and establish the sensitivity analysis of path-dependent discontinuous payoff functions. It will be realized after finding a relation between the stochastic flow of the solutions and their derivatives. The Malliavin derivatives are defined in a chaos approach in which the chain rule is not held. The convergence of the Euler method to approximate Delta Greek is proved. The simulation experiment illustrates our results to compute the Delta, in the context of financial mathematics, and demonstrates that the Malliavin Monte-Carlo computations applied in our formula are more efficient than using the finite difference method directly.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of geodesic midpoint fluctuations in last-passage percolation with general i.i.d. weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of transversal fluctuations of the optimal path is a crucial aspect of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In this work, we establish the large deviation limit for the midpoint transversal fluctuations in a general last-passage percolation (LPP) model with mild assumption on the i.i.d. weights. The rate function is expressed in terms of the right tail large deviation rate function of the last-passage value and the shape function. When the weights are chosen to be i.i.d. exponential random variables, our result verifies a conjecture communicated to us by Liu [Liu'22], showing the asymptotic probability of the geodesic from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ following the corner path $(0,0) \to (n,0) \to (n,n)$ is $({4}/{e^2})^{n+o(n)}$.</description>

      <title>Genetic contribution of advantaged ancestors in the biparental Moran model -- finite selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a population of N individuals evolving according to a biparental Moran model with two types, one being advantaged compared to the other. The advantage is conferred by a Mendelian mutation, that reduces the death probability of individuals carrying it. We assume that a proportion a of individuals initially carry this mutation, which therefore eventually gets fixed with high probability. After a long time, we sample a gene uniformly from the population, at a new locus, independent of the locus under selection, and calculate the probability that this gene originated from one of the initially advantaged individuals, when population size is large. Our theorem provides quantitative insights, such as the observation that under strong selection, if only 1% of the individuals are initially advantaged, approximately 19% of the population's genome will originate from them after a long time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stochastic parabolic evolution equations with time-dependent random generators and locally Lipschitz continuous drift terms. Using pathwise mild solutions, we construct an infinite-dimensional stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process, which is shown to be tempered in suitable function spaces. This property, together with a bootstrapping argument based on the regularizing effect of parabolic evolution families, is then applied to prove the global well-posedness and the existence of a random attractor for reaction-diffusion equations with random non-autonomous generators and nonlinearities satisfying certain growth and dissipativity assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph with independent identically distributed edge processes. Our aim is to describe the joint evolution of the entries of a subgraph count vector. The main result of this paper is a functional central limit theorem: we establish, under an appropriate centering and scaling, the joint functional convergence of the vector of subgraph counts to a specific multidimensional Gaussian process. The result holds under mild assumptions on the edge processes, most notably a Lipschitz-type condition.</description>

      <title>A coupling approach to Lipschitz transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a probabilistic approach to bound the (dimension-free) Lipschitz constant of the Langevin flow map on $\mathbb{R}^d$ introduced by Kim and Milman (2012). As example of application, we construct Lipschitz maps from a uniformly $\log$-concave probability measure to $\log$-Lipschitz perturbations as in Fathi, Mikulincer, Shenfeld (2024). Our proof is based on coupling techniques applied to the stochastic representation of the family of vector fields inducing the transport map. This method is robust enough to relax the uniform convexity to a weak asymptotic convexity condition and to remove the bound on the third derivative of the potential of the source measure.</description>

      <title>Generalized Counting Process with Random Drift and Different Brownian Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce drifted versions of the generalized counting process (GCP) with a deterministic drift and a random drift. The composition of stable subordinator with an independent inverse stable subordinator is taken as the random drift. We derive the probability law and its governing fractional differential equations for these drifted versions. Also, we study the GCP time-changed with different Brownian clocks, for example, the Brownian first passage-time with or without drift, elastic Brownian motion, Brownian sojourn time on positive half-line and the Bessel times. For these time-changed processes, we obtain the governing system of differential equation of their state probabilities, probability generating function, etc. Further, we consider a time-changed GCP where the time-change is done by subordinators linked to incomplete gamma function. Later, we study the fractional integral of GCP and its time-changed variant.</description>

      <title>On the extremal eigenvalues of Jacobi ensembles at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $\beta$-Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi ensembles of dimension $N$ there exist central limit theorems for the freezing case $\beta\to\infty$ such that the associated means and covariances can be expressed in terms of the associated Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials of order $N$ respectively as well as via the associated dual polynomials in the sense of de Boor and Saff. In this paper we derive limits for $N\to\infty$ for the covariances of the $r\in\mathbb N$ largest (and smallest) eigenvalues for these frozen Jacobi ensembles in terms of Bessel functions. These results correspond to the hard edge analysis in the frozen Laguerre cases by Andraus and Lerner-Brecher and to known results for finite $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Fluid limit and gelation in the frozen Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frozen Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph is a variant of the standard dynamical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph that prevents the creation of the giant component by freezing the evolution of connected components with a unique cycle. The formation of multicyclic components is forbidden, and the growth of components with a unique cycle is slowed down, depending on a parameter $p\in [0,1]$ that quantifies the slowdown. At the time when all connected components of the graph have a (necessary unique) cycle, the graph is entirely frozen and the process stops. In this paper we study the fluid limit of the main statistics of this process, that is their functional convergence as the number of vertices of the graph becomes large and after a proper rescaling, to the solution of a system of differential equations. Our proofs are based on an adaption of Wormald's differential equation method. We also obtain, as a main application, a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the first time when the graph is entirely frozen.</description>

      <title>Minkowski tensors for voxelized data: robust, asymptotically unbiased estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minkowski tensors, also known as tensor valuations, provide robust $n$-point information for a wide range of random spatial structures. Local estimators for voxelized data, however, are unavoidably biased even in the limit of infinitely high resolution. Here, we substantially improve a recently proposed, asymptotically unbiased algorithm to estimate Minkowski tensors for voxelized data. Our improved algorithm is more robust and efficient. Moreover we generalize the theoretical foundations for an asymptotically bias-free estimation of the interfacial tensors to the case of finite unions of compact sets with positive reach, which is relevant for many applications like rough surfaces or composite materials. As a realistic test case, we consider, among others, random (beta) polytopes. We first derive explicit expressions of the expected Minkowski tensors, which we then compare to our simulation results. We obtain precise estimates with relative errors of a few percent for practically relevant resolutions. Finally, we apply our methods to real data of metallic grains and nanorough surfaces, and we provide an open-source python package, which works in any dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the class of even polynomials and their behavior with respect to finite free convolutions. To this end, we use some specific hypergeometric polynomials and a variation of the rectangular finite free convolution to understand even real-rooted polynomials in terms of positive-rooted polynomials. Then, we study some classes of even polynomials that are of interest in finite free probability, such as even hypergeometric polynomials, symmetrizations, and finite free commutators. Specifically, we provide many new examples of these objects, involving classical families of special polynomials (such as Laguerre, Hermite, and Jacobi). Finally, we relate the limiting root distributions of sequences of even polynomials with the corresponding symmetric measures that arise in free probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic points and finitely supported invariant measures for continuous semigroup actions. Introducing suitable notions of periodicity in both topological and measure-theoretical contexts, we analyze the space of invariant Borel probability measures associated with these actions. For embeddable semigroups, we establish a direct relationship between the extensibility of invariant measures to the free group on the semigroup and the denseness of finitely supported invariant measures. Applying this framework to shift actions on the full shift, we prove that finitely supported invariant measures are dense for every left amenable semigroup that is residually a finite group and for every finite-rank free semigroup.</description>

      <title>The multi-index Monte Carlo method for semilinear stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are often difficult to solve numerically due to their low regularity and high dimensionality. These challenges limit the practical use of computer-aided studies and pose significant barriers to statistical analysis of SPDEs. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient multi-index Monte Carlo method (MIMC) designed to approximate statistics of mild solutions to semilinear parabolic SPDEs. Key to our approach is the proof of a multiplicative convergence property for coupled solutions generated by an exponential integrator numerical solver, which we incorporate with MIMC. We further describe theoretically how the asymptotic computational cost of MIMC can be bounded in terms of the input accuracy tolerance, as the tolerance goes to zero. Notably, our methodology illustrates that for an SPDE with low regularity, MIMC offers substantial performance improvements over other viable methods. Numerical experiments comparing the performance of MIMC with the multilevel Monte Carlo method on relevant test problems validate our theoretical findings. These results also demonstrate that MIMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multilevel Monte Carlo, thereby underscoring its potential as a robust and tractable tool for solving semilinear parabolic SPDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss some recent results by a number of authors regarding word maps on algebraic groups and finite simple groups, their mixing properties and the geometry of their fibers, emphasizing the role played by equidistribution results in finite fields via recent advances on character bounds and non-abelian arithmetic combinatorics. In particular, we discuss character varieties of random groups. In the last section, we give a new proof of a recent theorem of Hrushovski about the geometric irreducibility of the generic fibers of convolutions of dominant morphisms to simply connected algebraic groups.
  These notes stem out of lectures given by the authors in Oxford, and by the first author in ICTS Bangalore, in spring 2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the uniform-in-time weak propagation of chaos for the consensus-based optimization (CBO) method on a bounded searching domain. We apply the methodology for studying long-time behaviors of interacting particle systems developed in the work of Delarue and Tse (ArXiv:2104.14973). Our work shows that the weak error has order $O(N^{-1})$ uniformly in time, where $N$ denotes the number of particles. The main strategy behind the proofs are the decomposition of the weak errors using the linearized Fokker-Planck equations and the exponential decay of their Sobolev norms. Consequently, our result leads to the joint convergence of the empirical distribution of the CBO particle system to the Dirac-delta distribution at the global minimizer in population size and running time in Wasserstein-type metrics.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum under Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generalization properties of optimization algorithms under heavy-tailed noise has gained growing attention. However, the existing theoretical results mainly focus on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the analysis of heavy-tailed optimizers beyond SGD is still missing. In this work, we establish generalization bounds for SGD with momentum (SGDm) under heavy-tailed gradient noise. We first consider the continuous-time limit of SGDm, i.e., a Levy-driven stochastic differential equation (SDE), and establish quantitative Wasserstein algorithmic stability bounds for a class of potentially non-convex loss functions. Our bounds reveal a remarkable observation: For quadratic loss functions, we show that SGDm admits a worse generalization bound in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, indicating that the interaction of momentum and heavy tails can be harmful for generalization. We then extend our analysis to discrete-time and develop a uniform-in-time discretization error bound, which, to our knowledge, is the first result of its kind for SDEs with degenerate noise. This result shows that, with appropriately chosen step-sizes, the discrete dynamics retain the generalization properties of the limiting SDE. We illustrate our theory on both synthetic quadratic problems and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA) vs Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA): A Critical Review of Approaches in Operational Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed replacing all approaches for operational risk capital, including the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), with a simplified formula called the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA). This paper examines and criticizes the weaknesses and failures of SMA, such as instability, insensitivity to risk, superadditivity, and the implicit relationship between the SMA capital model and systemic risk in the banking sector. Furthermore, it discusses the issues of the proposed Operational Risk Capital (OpCar) model by the Basel Committee, a precursor to SMA. The paper concludes by advocating for the maintenance of the AMA internal model framework and suggests a series of standardization recommendations to unify internal operational risk modeling. The findings and viewpoints presented in this paper have been discussed and supported by numerous operational risk professionals and academics from various regions of the world.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Gradient Descent for Optimal Auto-Scaling in Serverless Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently manage serverless computing platforms, a key aspect is the auto-scaling of services, i.e., the set of computational resources allocated to a service adapts over time as a function of the traffic demand. The objective is to find a compromise between user-perceived performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we consider the \emph{scale-per-request} auto-scaling pattern and investigate how many function instances (or servers) should be spawned each time an \emph{unfortunate} job arrives, i.e., a job that finds all servers busy upon its arrival. We address this problem by following a stochastic optimization approach: we develop a stochastic gradient descent scheme of the Kiefer--Wolfowitz type that applies \emph{over a single run of the state evolution}. At each iteration, the proposed scheme computes an estimate of the number of servers to spawn each time an unfortunate job arrives to minimize some cost function. Under natural assumptions, we show that the sequence of estimates produced by our scheme is asymptotically optimal almost surely. In addition, we prove that its convergence rate is $O(n^{-2/3})$ where $n$ is the number of iterations.
  From a mathematical point of view, the stochastic optimization framework induced by auto-scaling exhibits non-standard aspects that we approach from a general point of view. We consider the setting where a controller can only get samples of the \emph{transient} -- rather than stationary -- behavior of the underlying stochastic system. To handle this difficulty, we develop arguments that exploit properties of the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain. By means of numerical simulations, we validate the proposed approach and quantify its gain with respect to common existing scale-up rules.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Multi-Index Models: Precise Asymptotics and Optimal Weak Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-index models provide a popular framework to investigate the learnability of functions with low-dimensional structure and, also due to their connections with neural networks, they have been object of recent intensive study. In this paper, we focus on recovering the subspace spanned by the signals via spectral estimators -- a family of methods that are routinely used in practice, often as a warm-start for iterative algorithms. Our main technical contribution is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral methods, when sample size and input dimension grow proportionally and the dimension $p$ of the space to recover is fixed. Specifically, we locate the top-$p$ eigenvalues of the spectral matrix and establish the overlaps between the corresponding eigenvectors (which give the spectral estimators) and a basis of the signal subspace. Our analysis unveils a phase transition phenomenon in which, as the sample complexity grows, eigenvalues escape from the bulk of the spectrum and, when that happens, eigenvectors recover directions of the desired subspace. The precise characterization we put forward enables the optimization of the data preprocessing, thus allowing to identify the spectral estimator that requires the minimal sample size for weak recovery.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of Random $d$-regular Graphs Up to the Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the normalized adjacency matrices of random $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices with fixed degree $d\geq3$. We prove that, with probability $1-N^{-1+{\varepsilon}}$ for any ${\varepsilon} &gt;0$, the following two properties hold as $N \to \infty$ provided that $d\geq3$: (i) The eigenvalues are close to the classical eigenvalue locations given by the Kesten-McKay distribution. In particular, the extremal eigenvalues are concentrated with polynomial error bound in $N$, i.e. $\lambda_2, |\lambda_N|\leq 2+N^{-c}$. (ii) All eigenvectors of random $d$-regular graphs are completely delocalized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of global nonnegative martingale solutions to cross-diffusion systems of Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto type with multiplicative noise is proven. The model describes the stochastic segregation dynamics of an arbitrary number of population species in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions. The diffusion matrix is generally neither symmetric nor positive semidefinite, which excludes standard methods for evolution equations. Instead, the existence proof is based on the entropy structure of the model, a novel regularization of the entropy variable, higher-order moment estimates, and fractional time regularity. The regularization technique is generic and is applied to the population system with self-diffusion in any space dimension and without self-diffusion in two space dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider non-local (in time) heat equations on time-increasing parabolic sets whose boundary is determined by a suitable curve. We provide a notion of solution for these equations and we study well-posedness under Dirichlet conditions outside the domain. A maximum principle is proved and used to derive uniqueness and continuity with respect to the initial datum of the solutions of the Dirichlet problem. Existence is proved by showing a stochastic representation based on the delayed Brownian motion killed on the boundary. Several related distributional properties of the delayed Brownian motion and its crossing probabilities are also obtained. The asymptotic behaviour of the mean square displacement of the process is determined, showing that the diffusive behaviour is anomalous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new probabilistic arguments to derive optimal-order central moment bounds in planar directed last-passage percolation. Our technique is based on couplings with the increment-stationary variants of the model, and is presented in the context of i.i.d. exponential weights for both zero and near-stationary boundary conditions. A main technical novelty in our approach is a new proof of the left-tail fluctuation upper bound with exponent 3/2 for the last-passage times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the facilitated exclusion process, an interacting particle system on the integer line where particles hop to one of their left or right neighbouring site only when the other neighbouring site is occupied by a particle. A peculiarity of this system is that, starting from the step initial condition, the density profile develops a downward jump discontinuity around the position of the first particle, unlike other exclusion processes such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). In the weakly asymmetric regime, we show that the field of particle positions around the jump discontinuity converges to the solution of the multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation (i.e. the exponential of a solution to the KPZ equation) on a half-line subject to Dirichlet boundary condition, with initial condition given by the derivative of a Dirac delta function. We prove this result by reformulating the problem in terms of ASEP on a half-line with a boundary reservoir, for which we extend known proofs of convergence to deal with Dirichlet boundary condition and the very singular type of initial condition that arises in our case.</description>

      <title>Signature SDEs from an affine and polynomial perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signature stochastic differential equations (SDEs) constitute a large class of stochastic processes, here driven by Brownian motions, whose characteristics are linear maps of their own signature, i.e. of iterated integrals of the process with itself, and allow therefore for a generic path dependence. We show that their prolongation with the corresponding signature is an affine and polynomial process taking values in the set of group-like elements of the extended tensor algebra. By relying on the duality theory for affine or polynomial processes, we obtain explicit formulas in terms of converging power series for the Fourier-Laplace transform and the expected value of entire functions of the signature process' marginals. The coefficients of these power series are solutions of extended tensor algebra valued Riccati and linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), respectively, whose vector fields can be expressed in terms of the characteristics of the corresponding SDEs. We thus construct a class of stochastic processes which is universal (in a sense specified in the introduction) within Ito-diffusions with path-dependent characteristics and allows for an explicit characterization of the Fourier-Laplace transform and hence the full law on path space. The practical applicability of this affine and polynomial approach is illustrated by several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Exit-problem for a class of non-Markov processes with path dependency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exit-time of a self-interacting diffusion from an open domain $G \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we consider the equation
  $d{X_t} = - \left( \nabla V(X_t) + \frac{1}{t}\int_0^t\nabla F (X_t - X_s)d{s} \right) d{t} + \sigma d{W_t}.$
  We are interested in the small-noise ($\sigma \to 0$) behaviour of the exit-time from the potentials' domain of attraction. In this work rather weak assumptions on the potentials $V$ and $F$, and on the domain $G$ are considered. In particular, we do not assume $V$ nor $F$ to be either convex or concave, which covers a wide range of self-attracting and self-repelling stochastic processes possibly moving in a complex multi-well landscape. The Large Deviation Principle for the Self-interacting diffusion with generalized initial conditions is established. The main result of the paper states that, under some assumptions on the potentials $V$ and $F$, and on the domain $G$, the Kramers' type law for the exit-time holds. Finally, we provide a result concerning the exit-location of the diffusion.</description>

      <title>Moments of polynomial functionals in Levy-driven queues with secondary jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11137v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $J(\cdot)$ be a compound Poisson process with rate $\lambda&gt;0$ and a jumps distribution $G(\cdot)$ concentrated on $(0,\infty)$. In addition, let $V$ be a random variable which is distributed according to $G(\cdot)$ and independent from $J(\cdot)$. Define a new process $W(t)\equiv W_V(t)\equiv V+J(t)-t$, $t\geqslant 0$ and let $\tau_V$ be the first time that $W(\cdot)$ hits the origin. A long-standing open problem due to Iglehart (1971) and Cohen (1979) is to derive the moments of the functional $\int_0^\tau W(t)\,{\rm d}t$ in terms of the moments of $G(\cdot)$ and $\lambda$. In the current work, we solve this problem in much greater generality, i.e., first by letting $J(\cdot)$ belong to a wide class of spectrally-positive L\'evy processes and secondly, by considering more general class of functionals. We also supply several applications of the existing results, e.g., in studying the process $x\mapsto \int_0^{\tau_x}W_x(t)\,{\rm d}t$ defined on $x\in[0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Closure properties and heavy tails: random vectors in the presence of dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is organized in three parts closely related to closure properties of heavy-tailed distributions and heavy-tailed random vectors. In the first part we consider two random variables X and Y with distributions F and G respectively. We assume that these random variables satisfy one type of a weak dependence structure. Under some mild conditions, we examine whether their product convolution distribution H belongs in the same distribution class of the distribution F. Namely we establish the closure property with respect to the product convolution, under this specific weak dependence structure, in the classes ERV, C, D, M, OS, OL, PD and K. Further in the second part we introduce a new distribution class, which satisfies some closure properties such as product and mixture.Further, we provide some applications on randomly weighted sums and on discrete-time risk model with dependent insurance and financial risks. Although the multivariate regular variation is well-established distribution, it does not happen in other heavy tailed random vectors. Therefore in the third part we introduced the class of dominatedly varying vectors and positively decreasing random vectors and we study the closure property of the independent scalar product under. Furthermore we study the closure property of the first class under sum and mixture, and we study the distribution of stopped sums where the summands are random vectors which belongs to this class. Some of these results holds and for positively decreasing random vectors.</description>

Abstract: Over fourty years ago, the physicist Polyakov proposed a bold framework for string theory, in which the problem was reduced to the study of certain "random surfaces". He further made the tantalising suggestion that this theory could be explicitly solved. Recent breakthroughs from the last fifteen years have not only given a concrete mathematical basis for this theory but also verified some of its most striking predictions, as well as Polyakov's original vision. This theory, now known in the mathematics literature either as Liouville quantum gravity or Liouville conformal field theory, is based on a remarkable combination of ideas coming from different fields, above all probability and geometry. This book is intended to be an introduction to these developments assuming as few prerequisites as possible.</description>

Abstract: In the paper we study markets with concave transaction costs which depend in a concave way on the volume of transaction. This is typical situation in the case of small investors, which commonly appears in currency and real estate markets. Sufficient conditions for absence of arbitrage are formulated.

      <title>Stochastic games of parental vaccination decision making and bounded rationality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent the spread of diseases. However, hesitancy and rejection of vaccines, particularly in childhood immunizations, pose challenges to vaccination efforts. In that case, according to rational decision-making and classical utility theory, parents weigh the costs of vaccination against the costs of not vaccinating their children. Social norms influence these parental decision-making outcomes, deviating their decisions from rationality. Additionally, variability in values of utilities stemming from stochasticity in parents' perceptions over time can lead to further deviations from rationality. In this paper, we employ independent white noises to represent stochastic fluctuations in parental perceptions of utility functions of the decisions over time, as well as in the disease transmission rates. This approach leads to a system of stochastic differential equations of a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model coupled with a stochastic replicator equation. We explore the dynamics of these equations and identify new behaviors emerging from stochastic influences. Interestingly, incorporating stochasticity into the utility functions for vaccination and nonvaccination leads to a decision-making model that reflects the bounded rationality of humans. Noise, like social norms, is a two-sided sword that depends on the degree of bounded rationality of each group. We also perform a stochastic optimal control as a discount to the cost of vaccination to counteract bounded rationality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study internal diffusion limited aggregation on $\mathbb{Z}$, where a cluster is grown by sequentially adding the first site outside the cluster visited by each random walk dispatched from the origin. We assume that the increment distribution $X$ of the driving random walks has $\mathbb{E} X =0$, but may be neither simple nor symmetric, and can have $\mathbb{E} (X^2) = \infty$, for example. For the case where $\mathbb{E} (X^2) &lt; \infty$, we prove that after $m$ walks have been dispatched, all but $o(m)$ sites in the cluster form an approximately symmetric contiguous block around the origin. This extends known results for simple random walk. On the other hand, if~$X$ is in the domain of attraction of a symmetric $\alpha$-stable law, $1 &lt; \alpha &lt;2$, we prove that the cluster contains a contiguous block of $\delta m +o(m)$ sites, where $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$, but, unlike the finite-variance case, one may not take $\delta=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider spread-out models of lattice trees and lattice animals on $\mathbb Z^d$, for $d$ above the upper critical dimension $d_{\mathrm c}=8$. We define a correlation length and prove that it diverges as $(p_c-p)^{-1/4}$ at the critical point $p_c$. Using this, we prove that the near-critical two-point function is bounded above by $C|x|^{-(d-2)}\exp[-c(p_c-p)^{1/4}|x|]$. We apply the near-critical bound to study lattice trees and lattice animals on a discrete $d$-dimensional torus (with $d &gt; d_{\mathrm c}$) of volume $V$. For $p_c-p$ of order $V^{-1/2}$, we prove that the torus susceptibility is of order $V^{1/4}$, and that the torus two-point function behaves as $|x|^{-(d-2)} + V^{-3/4}$ and thus has a plateau of size $V^{-3/4}$. The proofs require significant extensions of previous results obtained using the lace expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the normalized adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with any fixed degree $d\geq 3$ and denote its eigenvalues as $\lambda_1=d/\sqrt{d-1}\geq \lambda_2\geq\lambda_3\cdots\geq \lambda_N$. We establish the following two results as $N\rightarrow \infty$. (i) With high probability, all eigenvalues are optimally rigid, up to an additional $N^{{\rm o}(1)}$ factor. Specifically, the fluctuations of bulk eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-1+{\rm o}(1)}$, and the fluctuations of edge eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-2/3+{\rm o}(1)}$. (ii) Edge universality holds for random $d$-regular graphs. That is, the distributions of $\lambda_2$ and $-\lambda_N$ converge to the Tracy-Widom$_1$ distribution associated with the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. As a consequence, for sufficiently large $N$, approximately $69\%$ of $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices are Ramanujan, meaning $\max\{\lambda_2,|\lambda_N|\}\leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Entropic-Wasserstein barycenters: PDE characterization, regularity and CLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.10701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate properties of entropy-penalized Wasserstein barycenters introduced by Bigot, Cazelles and Papadakis (2019) as a regularization of Wasserstein barycenters first presented by Agueh and Carlier (2011). After characterizing these barycenters in terms of a system of Monge-Amp\`ere equations, we prove some global moment and Sobolev bounds as well as higher regularity properties. We finally establish a central limit theorem for entropic-Wasserstein barycenters.</description>

      <title>Global universal approximation of functional input maps on weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation Theorem and error bounds for quantum neural networks and quantum reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal approximation theorems are the foundations of classical neural networks, providing theoretical guarantees that the latter are able to approximate maps of interest. Recent results have shown that this can also be achieved in a quantum setting, whereby classical functions can be approximated by parameterised quantum circuits. We provide here precise error bounds for specific classes of functions and extend these results to the interesting new setup of randomised quantum circuits, mimicking classical reservoir neural networks. Our results show in particular that a quantum neural network with $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ weights and $\mathcal{O} (\lceil \log_2(\varepsilon^{-1}) \rceil)$ qubits suffices to achieve accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ when approximating functions with integrable Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Resolvability, Noise Stability, and Anti-contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates three closely related topics -- R\'enyi resolvability, noise stability, and anti-contractivity. The R\'enyi resolvability problem refers to approximating a target output distribution of a given channel in the R\'enyi divergence when the input is set to a function of a given uniform random variable. This problem for the R\'enyi parameter in $(0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$ was first studied by the present author and Tan in 2019. In the present paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem for the R\'enyi parameter in the entire range $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. We then connect the R\'enyi resolvability problem to the noise stability problem, by observing that maximizing or minimizing the $q$-stability of a set is equivalent to a variant of the R\'enyi resolvability problem. By such a connection, we provide sharp dimension-free bounds on the $q$-stability. We lastly relate the noise stability problem to the anti-contractivity of a Markov operator (i.e., conditional expectation operator), where the terminology ``anti-contractivity'' introduced by us refers to as the opposite property of the well-known contractivity/hyercontractivity. We derive sharp dimension-free anti-contractivity inequalities. All of the results in this paper are evaluated for binary distributions. Our proofs in this paper are mainly based on the method of types, especially strengthened versions of packing-covering lemmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new combinatorial proof of Parraud's formula for the asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N^2$ for the expected trace of polynomials of several independent $N \times N$ GUE matrices, which expresses the result using a mixture of free difference quotients, introducing new freely independent semicircular variables, and integration with respect to parameters. Our approach streamlines the statement of the formula while clarifying its relationship to the combinatorial genus expansion.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries of Service: Interdependence and Synchronicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On many dimensions, services can be seen to exist along spectra measuring the degree of interaction between customer and agent. For instance, every interaction features some number of contributions by each of those two sides, creating a spectrum of interdependence. Additionally, each interaction is further characterized by the relative pacing of these contributions, implying a spectrum of synchronicity. Where a service falls on such spectra can be a consequence of its design, but it can also be a function of its state. For instance, as broadly evidenced empirically, an agent with several concurrent interactions will be slowed in each individual interaction, altering the service's synchronicity. Here, we study a Hawkes cluster model of the service interaction, which we show captures the interdependence and synchronicity spectra and their resulting customer-agent (a)symmetries. We find insightful connections to behavioral operations, such as proving the occurrence of non-monotonic performance (e.g., inverted-U throughput) from concurrency-driven asynchrony. Hence, we can prescribe the agent's optimal concurrency level. Furthermore, we show how the service design dictates the efficacy of these operational improvements, proving that the concurrency-optimized throughput is itself non-monotonic as a function of the interdependence. Of possible independent interest methodologically, we establish an interpretable temporal decomposition for Hawkes clusters.</description>

      <title>Pricing and delta computation in jump-diffusion models with stochastic intensity by Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the pricing of financial derivatives and the calculation of their delta Greek when the underlying asset is a jump-diffusion process in which the stochastic intensity component follows the CIR process. Utilizing Malliavin derivatives for pricing financial derivatives and challenging to find the Malliavin weight for accurately calculating delta will be established in such models. Because asset prices rely on information from the intensity process, the moments of the Malliavin weights and the underlying asset must be bound. We apply the Euler scheme to show the convergence of the approximated solution, a financial derivative, and its delta Greeks and we have established the convergence analysis. Our approach has been validated through numerical experiments, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for risk management and hedging strategies in markets characterized by jump and stochastic intensity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scalable diffusion posterior sampling in infinite-dimensional inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this issue, we propose a scalable diffusion posterior sampling (SDPS) method to bypass forward mapping evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase, where a task-dependent score is learned based on the forward mapping. Crucially, the conditional posterior score is then derived from this trained score using affine transformations, ensuring no conditional score approximation is needed. The approach is shown to generalize to infinite-dimensional diffusion models and is validated through rigorous convergence analysis and high-dimensional CT imaging experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the Berry-Esseen bound for multivariate normal approximation for the Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates of the linear stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithm with decreasing step size. Moreover, we prove the non-asymptotic validity of the confidence intervals for parameter estimation with LSA based on multiplier bootstrap. This procedure updates the LSA estimate together with a set of randomly perturbed LSA estimates upon the arrival of subsequent observations. We illustrate our findings in the setting of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation.</description>

      <title>How Out-of-Distribution Detection Learning Theory Enhances Transformer: Learnability and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer networks excel in natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, they still face challenges in generalizing to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets, i.e. data whose distribution differs from that seen during training. The OOD detection aims to distinguish outliers while preserving in-distribution (ID) data performance. This paper introduces the OOD detection Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Theory for transformers, which establishes the conditions for data distribution and model configurations for the learnability of transformers in terms of OOD detection. The theory demonstrates that outliers can be accurately represented and distinguished with sufficient data. The theoretical implications highlight the trade-off between theoretical principles and practical training paradigms. By examining this trade-off, we naturally derived the rationale for leveraging auxiliary outliers to enhance OOD detection. Our theory suggests that by penalizing the misclassification of outliers within the loss function and strategically generating soft synthetic outliers, one can robustly bolster the reliability of transformer networks. This approach yields a novel algorithm that ensures learnability and refines the decision boundaries between inliers and outliers. In practice, the algorithm consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various data formats.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for output range analysis for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the output range estimation problem in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by integrating a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm tailored to operate within constrained domains and ensure convergence towards global optima. The method effectively addresses the challenges posed by the lack of local geometric information and the high non-linearity inherent to DNNs, making it applicable to a wide variety of architectures, with a special focus on Residual Networks (ResNets) due to their practical importance. Unlike existing methods, our algorithm imposes minimal assumptions on the internal architecture of neural networks, thereby extending its usability to complex models. Theoretical analysis guarantees convergence, while extensive empirical evaluations-including optimization tests involving functions with multiple local minima-demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm in navigating non-convex response surfaces. The experimental results highlight the algorithm's efficiency in accurately estimating DNN output ranges, even in scenarios characterized by high non-linearity and complex constraints. For reproducibility, Python codes and datasets used in the experiments are publicly available through our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Brownian motion with dependent components: turning angle analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion consider the different dimensions as independent components. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning often assumes a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors, leading to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. We introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning to enhance the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to address epistemic uncertainty by fully leveraging the GGD. We refine batch inverse variance weighting with bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, enhancing robustness. Experiments with policy gradient algorithms demonstrate significant performance gains.</description>

      <title>Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Poisson Point Process, Coulomb Gas, and Vortex Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point processes have broad applications in science and engineering. In physics, their use ranges from quantum chaos to statistical mechanics of many-particle systems. We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. As a physical application, we describe the spontaneous vortex formation during Bose-Einstein condensation in finite time recently studied in ultracold atom experiments and use the SFF to reveal the stochastic geometry of the resulting vortex patterns. In closing, we also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</description>

      <title>On the Impossibility of Equating the Youden Index with Tjur's $R^2$-like metrics in $2\times 2$ Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Hughes claimed an equivalence between Tjurs $R^2$ coefficient of discrimination and the Youden index for assessing diagnostic test performance on $2\times 2$ contingency tables. We prove an impossibility result when averaging over binary outcomes (0s and 1s) under any continuous real-valued scoring rule. Our finding clarifies the limitations of such a possible equivalence and highlights the distinct roles these metrics play in diagnostic test assessment.</description>

      <title>Score Change of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</description>

      <title>Universal geometric non-embedding of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta \ge 3$ be fixed, $n \ge n_\Delta$ be a large integer. It is a classical result that $\Delta$--regular expanders on $n$ vertices are not embeddable as geometric (distance) graphs into Euclidean space of dimension less than $c \log n$, for some universal constant $c$. We show that for typical $\Delta$-regular graphs, this obstruction is universal with respect to the choice of norm. More precisely, for a uniform random $\Delta$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it holds with high probability: there is no normed space of dimension less than $c\log n$ which admits a geometric graph isomorphic to $G$. The proof is based on a seeded multiscale $\varepsilon$--net argument.</description>

      <title>Almost sure bounds for weighted sums of Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that when $f$ is a Rademacher random multiplicative function for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, then $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{3/4+\epsilon}$ for almost all $f$. We also show that there exist arbitrarily large values of $x$ such that $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \gg (\log\log(x))^{-1/2}$. This is different to what is found in the Steinhaus case, this time with the size of the Rademacher Euler product making the multiplicative chaos contribution the dominant one. We also find a sharper upper bound when we restrict to integers with a prime factor greater than $\sqrt{x}$, proving that $\sum_{\substack{n \leqslant x \\ P(n) &gt; \sqrt{x}}}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{1/4+\epsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Trace Reconstruction of First-Order Reed-Muller Codewords Using Run Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an expression for the expected number of runs in a trace of a binary sequence $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ obtained by passing $x$ through a deletion channel that independently deletes each bit with probability $q$. We use this expression to show that if $x$ is a codeword of a first-order Reed-Muller code, and the deletion probability $q$ is 1/2, then $x$ can be reconstructed, with high probability, from $\tilde{O}(n)$ many of its traces.</description>

      <title>Improved estimates of statistical properties in some non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon previous works by Young, Chernov-Zhang and Bruin-Melbourne-Terhesiu, we present a general scheme to improve bounds on the statistical properties (in particular, decay of correlations, and rates in the almost sure invariant principle) for a class of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. Specifically, for systems with polynomial, yet summable mixing rates, our method removes logarithmic factors of earlier arguments, resulting in essentially optimal bounds. Applications include Wojtkowski's system of two falling balls, dispersing billiards with flat points and Bunimovich's flower-shaped billiard tables.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching: Markov Kernels, Stochastic Processes and Transport Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally, we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques, which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.</description>

      <title>Separating complexity classes of LCL problems on grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>
