      <title>Reply to "Comment on "Unified Framework for Open Quantum Dynamics with Memory""</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our response to the commentary piece by Makri {\it et al.} [arXiv:2410.08239], which raises critiques of our work [Nat. Commun. 15, 8087 (2024)]. In our paper, we considered various settings of open-quantum system dynamics, including non-commuting, non-diagonalizable system-bath coupling, and bosonic/spin/fermionic baths. For these, we showed a direct and explicit relationship between the discrete-time memory kernel ($\mathcal K$) of the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) and the discrete-time influence functions ($I$) of the path integrals. As an application of this, we showed one can construct $\mathcal K$ without projection-free dynamics inputs that conventional methods require, and we also presented a quantum sensing protocol that characterizes the bath spectral density from reduced system dynamics. As the Comment focused on the relationship between ($\mathcal K$) and $I$ in one specific setup (i.e., commuting, diagonalizable system-bath coupling with a bosonic bath), we focus on that aspect in this response. In summary, we could not find a set of equations that explicitly connect $I$ and $\mathcal K$ from Makri's 2020 paper [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. Furthermore, while our analysis is specific to the choice of discretization of path-integral and GQME, we have not found issues with the GQME discretization employed. As per critiques on citations, in our paper, we note that we had acknowledged Makri's driven SMatPI work and Wang and Cai's tree-based SMatPI work for the number of Dyck paths needed for the computation of the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-permittivity of Carbon Nitrides: Revealing humidity-enhanced dielectric properties on the picosecond timescales relevant for charge carrier photogeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic based semiconductor materials offer emerging and sustainable solutions for solar energy conversion technologies and electronics. However, knowledge of their intrinsic (photo)physical properties and light-matter interactions is often limited, especially with respect to the frequency dependent dielectric properties on the relevant timescales of exciton separation and charge generation (fs-ps). By using terahertz-time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), we show that the complex permittivity and THz conductivity of different polymer materials and graphitic carbon nitrides - melon and poly(heptazine imides) (K-PHI) - can be measured directly and accurately in different environmental humidities. Its effects are most strongly observed in the ionic and 2D carbon nitride, K-PHI, where both real permittivity and THz conductivity double from dry to humid conditions (~4-8 and 75-150 S/m, respectively) surpassing the intrinsic dielectric response from water or K-PHI through synergistic effects. Our findings are backed by fs-ps transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), confirming the impact of humidity on light conversion behaviour on the ps-timescale in K-PHI. We highlight the importance of dielectric property characterization at THz frequencies as critical for understanding photophysical behaviour at exciton or charge separation time scales, especially in the presence of water and hydrated ions, which may also be beneficial for computation, exploring next generation photocatalysts, electronics or ionotronics.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: technical details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, we develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators can quickly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) in a parameter space that encompasses the complex energy plane as well as other real-valued parameters in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and resolvent matrix elements with branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, we now have a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates them in the input parameter space. Some significant results have previously been presented in a short report (arXiv:2408.03309). Here, we provide details of the study and an in-depth analysis, including how this method could be coupled with existing approaches to compute and emulate bound and continuum states.</description>

      <title>Ro-vibrational Dynamics of the Neon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short intense laser pulses are routinely used to induce rotational wave packet dynamics of molecules. Ro-vibrational wave packet dynamics has been explored comparatively infrequently, focusing predominantly on extremely light and rigid molecules such as H$_2^+$, H$_2$, and D$_2$. This work presents quantum mechanical calculations that account for the rotational {\em{and}} the vibrational degrees of freedom for a heavier and rather floppy diatomic molecule, namely the neon dimer. For pumping by a strong and short non-resonant pump pulse, we identify several phenomena that depend critically on the vibrational (i.e., radial) degree of freedom. Our calculations show (i) fingerprints of the radial dynamics in the alignment signal; (ii) laser-kick induced dissociative dynamics on very short time scales (ejection of highly structured "jets"); and (iii) tunneling dynamics that signifies the existence of resonance states, which are supported by the effective potential curves for selected finite relative angular momenta. Our theory predictions can be explored by existing state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Computing excited states of molecules using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculations of highly excited and delocalized molecular vibrational states is a computationally challenging task, which strongly depends on the choice of coordinates for describing vibrational motions. We introduce a new method that utilizes normalizing flows (parametrized invertible functions) to optimize vibrational coordinates to satisfy the variational principle. This approach produces coordinates specifically tailored to the vibrational problem at hand, significantly increasing the accuracy and enhancing basis set convergence of calculated energy spectrum. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated in calculations of the 100 lowest excited vibrational states of H$_2$S, H$_2$CO, and HCN/CNH. The method effectively captures the essential vibrational behavior of molecules by enhancing the separability of the Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that the optimized coordinates are transferable across different levels of basis set truncation, enabling a cost-efficient protocol for computing vibrational spectra of high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>E3x: $\mathrm{E}(3)$-Equivariant Deep Learning Made Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces E3x, a software package for building neural networks that are equivariant with respect to the Euclidean group $\mathrm{E}(3)$, consisting of translations, rotations, and reflections of three-dimensional space. Compared to ordinary neural networks, $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant models promise benefits whenever input and/or output data are quantities associated with three-dimensional objects. This is because the numeric values of such quantities (e.g. positions) typically depend on the chosen coordinate system. Under transformations of the reference frame, the values change predictably, but the underlying rules can be difficult to learn for ordinary machine learning models. With built-in $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariance, neural networks are guaranteed to satisfy the relevant transformation rules exactly, resulting in superior data efficiency and accuracy. The code for E3x is available from https://github.com/google-research/e3x, detailed documentation and usage examples can be found on https://e3x.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Ground and Excited States from Ensemble Variational Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extension of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle to ensemble states $\rho_{\mathbf{w}}\equiv\sum_k w_k |\Psi_k\rangle \langle\Psi_k|$ with fixed weights $w_k$ lies ultimately at the heart of several recent methodological developments for targeting excitation energies by variational means. Prominent examples are density and density matrix functional theory, Monte Carlo sampling, state-average complete active space self-consistent field methods and variational quantum eigensolvers. In order to provide a sound basis for all these methods and to improve their current implementations, we prove the validity of the underlying critical hypothesis: Whenever the ensemble energy is well-converged, the same holds true for the ensemble state $\rho_{\mathbf{w}}$ as well as the individual eigenstates $|\Psi_k\rangle$ and eigenenergies $E_k$. To be more specific, we derive linear bounds $d_-\Delta{E}_{\mathbf{w}} \leq \Delta Q \leq d_+ \Delta{E}_{\mathbf{w}}$ on the errors $\Delta Q $ of these sought-after quantities. A subsequent analytical analysis and numerical illustration proves the tightness of our universal inequalities. Our results and particularly the explicit form of $d_{\pm}\equiv d_{\pm}^{(Q)}(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{E})$ provide valuable insights into the optimal choice of the auxiliary weights $w_k$ in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of confinement induced effects on atomic electronic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that although a litany of studies have been published on atoms in hard-wall confinement, they have not been systematic or have not used robust numerical methods. We report a methodical study of atoms in hard-wall confinement employing a robust finite element method (FEM) in HelFEM that guarantees variational results and allows easily finding the numerically exact solution. Our fully numerical calculations are non-relativistic and are carried out at three levels of density functional theory with spherically averaged densities: the PW92, PBE, and r$^2$SCAN functionals. The three are in excellent agreement, confirming the physicality of our results.
  We systematically examine low lying configurations of the H-Xe atoms and their monocations, and investigate how the configurations - especially the ground state - behave as a function of the position of the hard-wall boundary. We consider both spin-polarized as well as spin-restricted densities, and demonstrate that spin-polarization effects are significant in open shell configurations, even though some previous studies have only considered the spin-restricted model.
  We demonstrate the importance of considering ground state changes for confined atoms by computing the ionization radii for the H-Xe atoms and observe significant differences to earlier studies.
  Confirming previous observations, we identify electron shifts on the outermost shells for a majority of the elements: valence $s$ electrons are highly unfavored under strong confinement, and the high-lying $3d$ and $4f$ orbitals become occupied in atoms of periods 2-3 and 3-4, respectively.
  We also comment on deficiencies of a commonly used density based estimate for the van der Waals (vdW) radius of atoms, and propose a better behaved variant in terms of the number of electrons outside the vdW radius that we expect will prove useful in future studies.</description>
