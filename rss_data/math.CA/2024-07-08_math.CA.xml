      <title>The Impact of Data Dependence, Convergence and Stability by $AT$ Iterative Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to present the $AT$ algorithm, a novel two-step iterative approach for approximating fixed points of weak contractions within complete normed linear spaces. The article demonstrates the convergence of $AT$ algorithm towards fixed points of weak contractions. Notably, it establishes the algorithm's strong convergence properties, highlighting its faster convergence compared to established iterative methods such as $S$, normal-$S$, Varat, Mann, Ishikawa, $F^{*} $, and Picard algorithms. Additionally, the study explores the $AT$ algorithm's almost stable behavior for weak contractions. Emphasizing practical applicability, the paper offers data-dependent results through the $AT$ algorithm and substantiates findings with illustrative numerical examples</description>

      <title>Semiclassical limit of a non-polynomial $q$-Askey scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a semiclassical asymptotic formula for the two elements $\mathcal M$ and $\mathcal Q$ lying at the bottom of the recently constructed non-polynomial hyperbolic $q$-Askey scheme. We also prove that the corresponding exponent is a generating function of the canonical transformation between pairs of Darboux coordinates on the monodromy manifold of the Painlev\'e I and $\textrm{III}_3$ equations, respectively. Such pairs of coordinates characterize the asymptotics of the tau function of the corresponding Painlev\'e equation. We conjecture that the other members of the non-polynomial hyperbolic $q$-Askey scheme yield generating functions associated to the other Painlev\'e equations in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an elementary proof based on a penalization technique to show the existence and uniqueness of the solution to a system of variational inequalities modelling the friction-based motion of a two-body crawling system. Here for each body, the static and dynamic friction coefficients are equal.</description>

      <title>Optimal planar immersions of prescribed winding number and Arnold invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vladimir Arnold defined three invariants for generic planar immersions, i.e. planar curves whose self-intersections are all transverse double points. We use a variational approach to study these invariants by investigating a suitably truncated knot energy, the tangent-point energy. We prove existence of energy minimizers for each truncation parameter ${\delta} &gt; 0$ in a class of immersions with prescribed winding number and Arnold invariants, and establish Gamma convergence of the truncated tangent-point energies to a limiting renormalized tangent-point energy as ${\delta\to 0}$. Moreover, we show that any sequence of minimizers subconverges in ${C^1}$, and the corresponding limit curve has the same topological invariants, self-intersects exclusively at right angles, and minimizes the renormalized tangent-point energy among all curves with right self-intersection angles. In addition, the limit curve is an almost-minimizer for all of the original truncated tangent-point energies as long as the truncation parameter ${\delta}$ is sufficiently small. Therefore, this limit curve serves as an "optimal" curve in the class of generic planar immersions with prescribed winding number and Arnold invariants.</description>

      <title>Actual problems of the approximation theory in metrics of discrete spaces on sets of summable periodic and almost periodic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review paper highlights the main aspects of the development of research related to the solution of extreme problems in the theory of approximation in the spaces ${\mathcal S}^p$ and $B{\mathcal S}^p$ of periodic and almost periodic summable functions, respectively, where the $l_p$-norms of the sequences of Fourier coefficients are finite. In particular, the review contains the results known so far concerning the best, best $n$-term approximations and widths of classes of functions of one and many variables defined by means of $\psi$-derivatives and generalized moduli of smoothness in the spaces ${\mathcal S}^p$ and $B{\mathcal S}^p$. Particular attention is paid to the development of studies related to the derivation of direct and inverse approximation theorems in these spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of an Extremal Function for the Delsarte Extremal Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04410v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the general setting of a locally compact Abelian group $G$, the Delsarte extremal problem asks for the supremum of integrals over the collection of continuous positive definite functions $f: G \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(0) = 1$ and having $\mathrm{supp} f_{+} \subset \Omega$ for some measurable subset $\Omega$ of finite measure. In this paper, we consider the question of the existence of an extremal function for the Delsarte extremal problem. In particular, we show that there exists an extremal function for the Delsarte problem when $\Omega$ is closed, extending previously known existence results to a larger class of functions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Lipschitz functions via commutators of maximal operators on slice spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $0 \leq \alpha&lt;n$, $M_{\alpha}$ be the fractional maximal operator, $M^{\sharp}$ be the sharp maximal operator and $b$ be the locally integrable function. Denote by $[b, M_{\alpha}]$ and $[b, M^{\sharp}]$ be the commutators of the fractional maximal operator $M_{\alpha}$ and the sharp maximal operator $M^{\sharp}$. In this paper, we show some necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the commutators $[b, M_{\alpha}]$ and $[b, M^{\sharp}]$ on slice spaces when the function $b$ is the Lipschitz function, by which some new characterizations of the non-negative Lipschitz function are obtained</description>

      <title>Potential trace inequalities via a Calder\'on-type theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an approach to trace inequalities for potential-type operators based on an appropriate modification of an interpolation theorem due to Calder\'on. We develop a general theoretical tool for establishing boundedness of notoriously difficult operators (such as potentials) on certain specific types of rearrangement-invariant function spaces from analogous properties of operators that are easier to handle (such as fractional maximal operators). The key ingredient for the development of the theory is the initial pair of endpoint estimates for the easier operator whose pivotal example is based on a two-weight inequality of Sawyer. Among various applications we obtain a generalization of the celebrated trace inequality involving the Riesz potential and the Hausdorff content by Korobkov and Kristensen.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Parameter Singular Perturbation Analysis of the Robertson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robertson model describing a chemical reaction involving three reactants is one of the classical examples of stiffness in ODEs. The stiffness is caused by the occurrence of three reaction rates $k_1,\,k_2$, and $k_3$, with largely differing orders of magnitude, acting as parameters. The model has been widely used as a numerical test problem. Surprisingly, no asymptotic analysis of this multiscale problem seems to exist. In this paper we provide a full asymptotic analysis of the Robertson model under the assumption $k_1, k_3 \ll k_2$. We rewrite the equations as a two-parameter singular perturbation problem in the rescaled small parameters $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2):=(k_1/k_2,k_3/k_2)$, which we then analyze using geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). To deal with the multi-parameter singular structure, we perform blow-ups in parameter- and variable space. We identify four distinct regimes in a neighbourhood of the singular limit \mbox{$(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)= (0,0)$}. Within these four regimes we use GSPT and additional blow-ups to analyze the dynamics and the structure of solutions. Our asymptotic results are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerics.</description>

      <title>On the stochastic selection of integral curves of a rough vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for bounded, divergence-free vector fields b in L^1_{loc}((0,1];BV(\T^d;\R^d)), there exists a unique incompressible measure on integral curves of b. We recall the vector field constructed by Depauw in [Depauw, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003], which lies in the above class, and prove that for this vector field, the unique incompressible measure on integral curves exhibits stochasticity.</description>
