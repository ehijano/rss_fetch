      <title>Efficient Optimization of Low-Rank Antisymmetric Product of Geminals Wavefunction Using the Direct Givens Rotation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous study, we proposed the low-rank antisymmetric product of geminals (APG) method, which reconstructs the wavefunction by extracting only the important eigenvalues from the APG wave function. However, its practical application was limited by the high computational cost from an orbital optimization process, making higher-rank calculations difficult. In this work, we reformulate the orbital part of the wavefunction using Givens rotation matrices, enabling an analytical treatment of the variational optimization. By combining the low-rank APG with the direct Givens rotation (DGR) method, we achieved a significant improvement in optimization efficiency. We applied the developed method to small molecular systems and confirmed that it provides high accuracy, while also significantly reducing the computational time compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Load-Balanced Diffusion Monte Carlo Method with Lattice Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations. QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers, making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework. DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance, which grows as $\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high parallel efficiency ($\sim$98\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\rm w}= 51200$), together with a speedup of $\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers.</description>

      <title>Re-weighting estimator for ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations of fictitious identical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem constitutes one of the most fundamental obstacles in quantum many-body theory. Recently, it has been suggested to circumvent the sign problem by carrying out path integral simulations with a fictitious quantum statistics variable $\xi$, which allows for a smooth interpolation between the bosonic and fermionic limits [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This $\xi$-extrapolation method has subsequently been applied to a variety of systems and has facilitated the analysis of an x-ray scattering measurement taken at the National Ignition Facility with unprecedented accuracy [\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. Yet, it comes at the cost of performing an additional $10-20$ simulations, which, in combination with the required small error bars, can pose a serious practical limitation. Here, we remove this bottleneck by presenting a new re-weighting estimator, which allows the study of the full $\xi$-dependence from a single path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation. This is demonstrated for various observables of the uniform electron gas and also warm dense beryllium. We expect our work to be useful for future PIMC simulations of Fermi systems, including ultracold atoms, electrons in quantum dots, and warm dense quantum plasmas.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Electrochemical Model of Cathodic Corrosion in Alkaline Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical corrosion significantly reduces the durability of electrodes in water electrolyzers, adversely affecting hydrogen (H$_2$) production and cell efficiency. Current theoretical models inadequately assess corrosion behaviors in alkaline water electrolyzers. To address this, we developed a physics-informed electrochemical corrosion model evaluating the corrosion characteristics of cathodes in alkaline systems, accounting for factors such as exchange current density ($J_0$), redox potential ($E_0$), Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption ($\Delta G_{\rm H}$), electrolyte concentration ($C$), system pressure ($P$), and temperature ($T$). The model calculates metrics including corrosion potential ($E_{\rm corr}$), corrosion current density ($J_{\rm corr}$), and corrosion rate ($C_R$). Our findings from potentiodynamic polarization indicate that gold (Au) shows the highest durability, while copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) are promising cost-effective alternatives. This work enhances the understanding of corrosion dynamics, contributing to the design of more efficient electrolyzer cells for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>High-entropy oxide photocatalysts for green ammonia synthesis from nitrogen fixation in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia, a critical chemical fertilizer and a potential hydrogen carrier, can be sustainably synthesized from atmospheric nitrogen and water under ambient conditions through photocatalysis. In this study, high-entropy oxides with d0 and mixed d0+d10 cationic configurations are introduced as a new group of catalysts for nitrogen fixation and photocatalytic ammonia production. The oxides exhibit impressive efficiency in ammonia production compared to binary oxides, while the efficiency is improved by using a mixed cationic configuration. It was shown that the incorporation of d10 elements, such as gallium and zinc, boosts the photocatalytic reactions by improving light absorbance, charge separation and charge lifetime. These findings demonstrate the potential of high-entropy oxides as next-generation photocatalysts for green ammonia synthesis, offering an effective alternative to conventional catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian basis sets for all-electron excited-state calculations of large molecules and the condensed phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of all-electron Gaussian basis sets, augmented MOLOPT, optimized for excited-state calculations on large molecules and crystals. We generate these basis sets by augmenting existing STO-3G, STO-6G, and MOLOPT basis sets optimizied for ground state energy calculations. The augmented MOLOPT basis sets achieve fast convergence of $GW$ gaps and Bethe-Salpeter excitation energies, while maintaining low condition numbers of the overlap matrix to ensure numerical stability. For $GW$ HOMO-LUMO gaps, the double-zeta augmented MOLOPT basis yields a mean absolute deviation of 60 meV to the complete basis set limit. The basis set convergence for excitation energies from time-dependent density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is similar. We use our smallest generated augmented MOLOPT basis (aug-SZV-MOLOPT-ae-mini) to demonstrate $GW$ calculations on nanographenes with 2312 atoms requiring only 3500 core hours and 2.9 TB RAM as computational resources.</description>

      <title>aims-PAX: Parallel Active eXploration for the automated construction of Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning force fields (MLFF) have significantly extended the capabilities of atomistic simulations. This progress highlights the critical need for reliable reference datasets, accurate MLFFs, and, crucially, efficient active learning strategies to enable robust modeling of complex chemical and materials systems. Here, we introduce aims-PAX, an automated, multi-trajectory active learning framework that streamlines the development of MLFFs. Designed for both experts and newcomers, aims-PAX offers a modular, high-performance workflow that couples flexible sampling with scalable training across CPU and GPU architectures. Built on the widely adopted ab initio code FHI-aims, the framework seamlessly integrates with state-of-the-art ML models and supports pretraining using general-purpose (or "foundational") models for rapid deployment in diverse systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of aims-PAX on two challenging systems: a highly flexible peptide and bulk CsPbI$_3$ perovskite. Across these cases, aims-PAX achieves a reduction of up to two orders of magnitude in the number of required reference calculations and enables over 20x speedup in AL cycle time through optimized resource utilization. This positions aims-PAX as a powerful and versatile platform for next-generation ML-driven atomistic simulations in both academic and industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Computing Exchange Coupling constants in Transition metal complexes with Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal complexes present significant challenges for electronic structure theory due to strong electron correlation arising from partially filled $d$-orbitals. We compare our recently developed Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction (TPSCI) with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) for computing exchange coupling constants in six transition metal systems, including dinuclear Cr, Fe, and Mn complexes and a tetranuclear Ni-cubane. TPSCI uses a locally correlated tensor product state basis to capture electronic structure efficiently while maintaining interpretability. From calculations on active spaces ranging from (22e,29o) to (42e,49o), we find that TPSCI consistently yields higher variational energies than DMRG due to truncation of local cluster states, but provides magnetic exchange coupling constants (J) generally within 10-30 cm$^{-1}$ of DMRG results. Key advantages include natural multistate capability enabling direct J extrapolation with smaller statistical errors, and computational efficiency for challenging systems. However, cluster state truncation represents a fundamental limitation requiring careful convergence testing, particularly for large local cluster dimensions. We identify specific failure cases where current truncation schemes break down, highlighting the need for improved cluster state selection methods and distributed memory implementations to realize TPSCI's full potential for strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>How reactive is water at the nanoscale and how to control it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoconfined water plays a key role in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and catalysis, yet its reactivity remains a matter of debate. Prior studies have reported both enhanced and suppressed water self-dissociation relative to the bulk, but without a consistent explanation. Here, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials trained at first-principles accuracy, we investigate dissociation behavior in water confined within 2D slit pores and nanodroplets, using graphene and hexagonal boron nitride as model materials. We find that reactivity is extremely sensitive to water density, confinement width, geometry, material flexibility, and surface chemistry. Despite this complexity, we show that chemical potential -- together with interfacial interactions -- governs dissociation trends and explains the variability observed in prior studies. This thermodynamic perspective reconciles previous contradictions and reveals how nanoscale environments can drastically shift water reactivity. Our findings provide molecular-level insight and offer a design lever for modulating water chemistry at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Simulations of Catalytic Metal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantum simulations of catalysis on metal surfaces are critical for advancing energy and materials science. Yet most existing methods fall short: density functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational efficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction energetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface, where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of complex catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Trotter simulation of vibrational Hamiltonians on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating vibrational dynamics is essential for understanding molecular structure, unlocking useful applications such as vibrational spectroscopy for high-fidelity chemical detection. Quantum algorithms for vibrational dynamics are emerging as a promising alternative to resource-demanding classical approaches, but this domain is largely underdeveloped compared to quantum simulations of electronic structure. In this work, we describe in detail three distinct forms of the vibrational Hamiltonian: canonical bosonic quantization, real space representation, and the Christiansen second-quantized form. Leveraging Lie algebraic properties of each, we develop efficient fragmentation schemes to enable the use of Trotter product formulas for simulating time evolution. We introduce circuits required to implement time evolution in each form, and highlight factors that contribute to the simulation cost, including the choice of vibrational coordinates. Using a perturbative approach for the Trotter error, we obtain tight estimates of T gate cost for the simulation of time evolution in each form, enabling their quantitative comparison. Combining tight Trotter error estimates and efficient fragmentation schemes, we find that for the medium-sized CH$_4$ molecule with 9 vibrational modes, time evolution for approximately 1.8 ps may be simulated using as little as 36 qubits and approximately $3 \times 10^{8}$ T gates -- an order-of-magnitude speedup over prior-art algorithms. Finally, we present calculations of vibrational spectra using each form to demonstrate the fidelity of our algorithms. This work presents a unified and highly optimized framework that makes simulating vibrational dynamics an attractive use case for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enhanced by Synergetic Interactions among Photon Phonon and Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Relativistic atomic structure calculations in support of spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory can provide important support at all the stages of spectroscopic experiments, from planning the measurements to the interpretation of the results. Such support is particularly valuable for the challenging experiments on heavy, unstable, and superheavy elements and for precision measurements aimed at testing the Standard Model of particle physics. To be reliable and useful in experimental context, theoretical predictions should be based on high-accuracy calculations. For heavy elements, such calculations must treat both relativistic effects and electron correlation on the highest possible level. Relativistic coupled cluster is considered one of the most powerful methods for accurate calculations on heavy many-electron atoms and molecules. This approach is highly accurate and versatile and can be used to obtain energies and a variety of atomic and molecular properties. Furthermore, its robust and transparent formulation allows for systematic improvement of the accuracy of the calculated results and for assigning uncertainties on theoretical values. The Fock-space coupled cluster (FSCC) variant of this method is particularly useful in the context of spectroscopic measurements as it provides access to atomic spectra and properties of the excited states. In this review, we present in detail the relativistic coupled cluster approach and its FSCC variant. We provide a description of the computational procedure used for accurate calculations and for assigning uncertainties. Outstanding recent examples of application to atomic properties, focusing on the experimental context are presented. Finally, we provide a brief discussion of the perspectives for future developments and applications of the CC approach.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a dramatic enhancement of supercontinuum generation (SCG) in H$_2$O driven by non-harmonic two-color laser fields, where pump and seed frequencies are not integer multiples. This scheme yields a broadband SC spectrum enhanced by approximately three orders of magnitude over the single-color case. Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis, including isotope effects, show that the enhancement arises from soliton compression with resonant dispersive wave (RDW) emission, phase- and group-velocity-matched four-wave mixing (FWM), and cross-phase modulation (XPM), offering a versatile route to stronger SCG and noise suppression in broadband spectroscopy in H$_2$O, an emerging topic in attosecond and surface physics.</description>

      <title>Application of Quantum Annealing to Computation of Molecular Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of our quantum annealing computations of the permanent electric dipole
  moments of several molecules. By applying an electric field as a perturbation and measuring the
  corresponding energy responses, the molecular electric dipole moments are obtained numerically
  through the finite field method. The ground-state electronic wavefunctions and energies are obtained
  using the quantum annealer eignsolver algorithm. This work provides a pathway for the computation
  of molecular properties in the quantum annealing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Kinetic rates calculation via non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel computational approach based on ratchet-and-pawl molecular dynamics (rMD) for accurately estimating ligand dissociation kinetics in protein-ligand complexes. By integrating Kramers' theory with Bell's equation, our method systematically investigates the relationship between the effective biasing force applied during simulations and the ligand residence times. The proposed technique is demonstrated through extensive simulations of the benzamidine-trypsin complex, employing first an implicit solvent model (multi-eGO) to set up the approach parameters and thus an explicit solvent model. Our results illustrate the method's reliability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, with calculated kinetic rates closely matching experimental values. Overall, this study highlights rMD as a versatile and efficient non-equilibrium methodology, broadly applicable to kinetic analyses in chemical and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Nernst-Planck charging dynamics of an electric double layer capacitor: symmetric and asymmetric binary electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy with Tunable Visible Broadband Probe Pulse Generated by Kerr-Instability Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a significantly reduced cost to OPA implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KAB-SRS by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclei by smashing them at high energies: how are their shapes revealed after destruction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions have recently emerged as a promising ``imaging-by-smashing'' approach that may reveal the intrinsic shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I outline a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>
