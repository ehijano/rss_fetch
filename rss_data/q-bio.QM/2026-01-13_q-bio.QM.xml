      <title>Computational Mapping of Reactive Stroma in Prostate Cancer Yields Interpretable, Prognostic Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current histopathological grading of prostate cancer relies primarily on glandular architecture, largely overlooking the tumor microenvironment. Here, we present PROTAS, a deep learning framework that quantifies reactive stroma (RS) in routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides and links stromal morphology to underlying biology. PROTAS-defined RS is characterized by nuclear enlargement, collagen disorganization, and transcriptomic enrichment of contractile pathways. PROTAS detects RS robustly in the external Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) dataset and, using domain-adversarial training, generalizes to diagnostic biopsies. In head-to-head comparisons, PROTAS outperforms pathologists for RS detection, and spatial RS features predict biochemical recurrence independently of established prognostic variables (c-index 0.80). By capturing subtle stromal phenotypes associated with tumor progression, PROTAS provides an interpretable, scalable biomarker to refine risk stratification.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Feature Discovery in Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Data Using Neural Network Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for analyzing intracranial pressure monitoring data by applying interpretability principles. Intracranial pressure monitoring data was collected from 60 patients at Johns Hopkins. The data was segmented into individual cardiac cycles. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify each cardiac cycle into one of seven body positions. Neural network attention was extracted and was used to identify regions of interest in the waveform. Further directions for exploration are identified. This framework provides an extensible method to further understand the physiological and clinical underpinnings of the intracranial pressure waveform, which could lead to better diagnostic capabilities for intracranial pressure monitoring.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-inspired Structure Hallucination for Protein-protein Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) represents a central challenge within the biology field, and accurately predicting the consequences of mutations in this context is crucial for drug design and protein engineering. Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our hallucination strategy and the PDC module in addressing the absence of mutant protein structure and modeling geometric uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Pseudodata-guided Invariant Representation Learning Boosts the Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Enzymatic Kinetic Parameter Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is essential for understanding catalytic mechanisms and guiding enzyme engineering.However, existing deep learning-based enzyme-substrate interaction (ESI) predictors often exhibit performance degradation on sequence-divergent, out-of-distribution (OOD) cases, limiting robustness under biologically relevant perturbations.We propose O$^2$DENet, a lightweight, plug-and-play module that enhances OOD generalization via biologically and chemically informed perturbation augmentation and invariant representation learning.O$^2$DENet introduces enzyme-substrate perturbations and enforces consistency between original and augmented enzyme-substrate-pair representations to encourage invariance to distributional shifts.When integrated with representative ESI models, O$^2$DENet consistently improves predictive performance for both $k_{cat}$ and $K_m$ across stringent sequence-identity-based OOD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results among the evaluated methods in terms of accuracy and robustness metrics.Overall, O$^2$DENet provides a general and effective strategy to enhance the stability and deployability of data-driven enzyme kinetics predictors for real-world enzyme engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Charting the velocity of brain growth and development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain charts have emerged as a highly useful approach for understanding brain development and aging on the basis of brain imaging and have shown substantial utility in describing typical and atypical brain development with respect to a given reference model. However, all existing models are fundamentally cross-sectional and cannot capture change over time at the individual level. We address this using velocity centiles, which directly map change over time and can be overlaid onto cross-sectionally derived population centiles. We demonstrate this by modelling rates of change for 24062 scans from 10795 healthy individuals with up to 8 longitudinal measurements across the lifespan. We provide a method to detect individual deviations from a stable trajectory, generalising the notion of thrive lines, which are used in pediatric medicine to declare failure to thrive. Using this approach, we predict transition from mild cognitive impairment to dementia more accurately than by using either time point alone, replicated across two datasets. Last, by taking into account multiple time points, we improve the sensitivity of velocity models for predicting the future trajectory of brain change. This highlights the value of predicting change over time and makes a fundamental step towards precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Topological model selection: a case-study in tumour-induced angiogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing mathematical models offers a means to evaluate competing scientific theories. However, exact methods of model calibration are not applicable to many probabilistic models which simulate high-dimensional spatio-temporal data. Approximate Bayesian Computation is a widely-used method for parameter inference and model selection in such scenarios, and it may be combined with Topological Data Analysis to study models which simulate data with fine spatial structure. We develop a flexible pipeline for parameter inference and model selection in spatio-temporal models. Our pipeline identifies topological summary statistics which quantify spatio-temporal data and uses them to approximate parameter and model posterior distributions. We validate our pipeline on models of tumour-induced angiogenesis, inferring four parameters in three established models and identifying the correct model in synthetic test-cases.</description>

      <title>Notation-level confounding: When inconsistent molecular notations mislead chemical language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical language models (CLMs) are increasingly used for molecular design and property prediction. Because these models learn from textual encodings of molecules, differences in how such encodings are generated may affect their behavior. In cheminformatics, the term Canonical SMILES implies a single standardized notation, yet each toolkit defines distinct canonicalization rules, yielding multiple "canonical" strings for the same molecule. To examine how this variability arises and why it matters, we surveyed 264 CLM papers in PubMed, reflecting the field's diverse computational backgrounds. About half did not specify their canonicalization procedure, limiting transparency and reproducibility. Using a molecular translation framework, we show that inconsistent notations distort latent representations and, in some benchmarks, spuriously inflate predictive accuracy-a phenomenon we call notationlevel confounding. These findings reveal how subtle differences in SMILES generation can mislead CLMs and highlight the need for explicit reporting of preprocessing tools and settings.</description>

      <title>AntibodyDesignBFN: High-Fidelity Fixed-Backbone Antibody Design via Discrete Bayesian Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational design of antibodies with high specificity and affinity is a cornerstone of modern therapeutic development. While deep generative models, particularly Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have demonstrated the ability to generate realistic antibody structures, they often suffer from high computational costs and the difficulty of modeling discrete variables like amino acid sequences. In this work, we present AntibodyDesignBFN, a novel framework for fixed-backbone antibody design based on Discrete Bayesian Flow Networks(BFN). Unlike standard diffusion models that rely on Gaussian noise removal or complex discrete corruption processes, BFNs operate directly on the parameters of the data distribution, enabling a continuous-time, fully differentiable generative process on the probability simplex. While recent pioneering works like IgCraft and AbBFN have introduced BFNs to the domain of antibody sequence generation and inpainting, our work focuses specifically on the inverse folding task-designing sequences that fold into a fixed 3D backbone. By integrating a lightweight Geometric Transformer utilizing Invariant Point Attention (IPA) and a resource-efficient training strategy with gradient accumulation, our model achieves superior performance. Evaluations on a rigorous 2025 temporal test set reveal that AntibodyDesignBFN achieves a robust Amino Acid Recovery (AAR) , demonstrating that BFNs, when conditioned on 3D geometric constraints, offer a robust mathematical framework for high-fidelity antibody design.Code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/YueHuLab/AntibodyDesignBFN and https://huggingface.co/YueHuLab/AntibodyDesignBFN, respectively.</description>

      <title>Rep3Net: An Approach Exploiting Multimodal Representation for Molecular Bioactivity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of compound potency accelerates early-stage drug discovery by prioritizing candidates for experimental testing. However, many Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) approaches for this prediction are constrained by their choice of molecular representation: handcrafted descriptors capture global properties but miss local topology, graph neural networks encode structure but often lack broader chemical context, and SMILES-based language models provide contextual patterns learned from large corpora but are seldom combined with structural features. To exploit these complementary signals, we introduce Rep3Net, a unified multimodal architecture that fuses RDKit molecular descriptors, graph-derived features from a residual graph-convolutional backbone, and ChemBERTa SMILES embeddings. We evaluate Rep3Net on a curated ChEMBL subset for Human PARP1 using fivefold cross validation. Rep3Net attains an MSE of $0.83\pm0.06$, RMSE of $0.91\pm0.03$, $R^{2}=0.43\pm0.01$, and yields Pearson and Spearman correlations of $0.66\pm0.01$ and $0.67\pm0.01$, respectively, substantially improving over several strong GNN baselines. In addition, Rep3Net achieves a favorable latency-to-parameter trade-off thanks to a single-layer GCN backbone and parallel frozen encoders. Ablations show that graph topology, ChemBERTa semantics, and handcrafted descriptors each contribute complementary information, with full fusion providing the largest error reduction. These results demonstrate that multimodal representation fusion can improve potency prediction for PARP1 and provide a scalable framework for virtual screening in early-stage drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Graph Autoregressive Modeling: Molecular Property Prediction via Next Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Connection-Aware Motif Sequencing (CamS), a graph-to-sequence representation that enables decoder-only Transformers to learn molecular graphs via standard next-token prediction (NTP). For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences.</description>
