      <title>Dynamic Boolean Synthesis with Zero-suppressed Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by functional synthesis in sequential circuit construction and quantified boolean formulas (QBF), boolean synthesis serves as one of the core problems in Formal Methods. Recent advances show that decision diagrams (DD) are particularly competitive in symbolic approaches for boolean synthesis, among which zero-suppressed decision diagram (ZDD) is a relatively new algorithmic approach, but is complementary to the industrial portfolio, where binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are more often applied. We propose a new dynamic-programming ZDD-based framework in the context of boolean synthesis, show solutions to theoretical challenges, develop a tool, and investigate the experimental performance. We also propose an idea of magic number that functions as the upper bound of planning-phase time and treewidth, showing how to interpret the exploration-exploitation dilemma in planning-execution synthesis framework. The algorithm we propose shows its strengths in general, gives inspiration for future needs to determine industrial magic numbers, and justifies that the framework we propose is an appropriate addition to the industrial synthesis solvers portfolio.</description>

      <title>aLEAKator: HDL Mixed-Domain Simulation for Masked Hardware \&amp; Software Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verifying the security of masked hardware and software implementations, under advanced leakage models, remains a significant challenge, especially then accounting for glitches, transitions and CPU micro-architectural specifics. Existing verification approaches are either restricted to small hardware gadgets, small programs on CPUs such as Sboxes, limited leakage models, or require hardware-specific prior knowledge. In this work, we present aLEAKator, an open-source framework for the automated formal verification of masked cryptographic accelerators and software running on CPUs from their HDL descriptions. Our method introduces mixed-domain simulation, enabling precise modeling and verification under various (including robust and relaxed) 1-probing leakage models, and supports variable signal granularity without being restricted to 1-bit wires. aLEAKator also supports verification in the presence of lookup tables, and does not require prior knowledge of the target CPU architecture. Our approach is validated against existing tools and real-world measurements while providing innovative results such as the verification of a full, first-order masked AES on various CPUs</description>

      <title>Specializing anti-unification for interaction models composition via gate connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interaction models describe distributed systems as algebraic terms, with gates marking interaction points between local views. Composing local models into a coherent global one requires aligning these gates while respecting the algebraic laws of interaction operators. We specialize anti-unification (or generalization) via a special constant-preserving variant, which preserves designated constants while generalizing the remaining structure. We develop a dedicated rule-based procedure for computing these generalizations, prove its termination, soundness, and completeness, extend it modulo equational theories, and integrate it into a standard anti-unification framework. A prototype tool demonstrates the approach's ability to recompose global interactions from partial views.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Structure and Chord Constraints in Symbolic Transformer-based Melodic Harmonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures offer significant advantages regarding the generation of symbolic music; their capabilities for incorporating user preferences toward what they generate is being studied under many aspects. This paper studies the inclusion of predefined chord constraints in melodic harmonization, i.e., where a desired chord at a specific location is provided along with the melody as inputs and the autoregressive transformer model needs to incorporate the chord in the harmonization that it generates. The peculiarities of involving such constraints is discussed and an algorithm is proposed for tackling this task. This algorithm is called B* and it combines aspects of beam search and A* along with backtracking to force pretrained transformers to satisfy the chord constraints, at the correct onset position within the correct bar. The algorithm is brute-force and has exponential complexity in the worst case; however, this paper is a first attempt to highlight the difficulties of the problem and proposes an algorithm that offers many possibilities for improvements since it accommodates the involvement of heuristics.</description>
