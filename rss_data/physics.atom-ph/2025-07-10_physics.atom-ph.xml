      <title>Quantum theory of magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) from first principles based on the quantum kinetic equation for the atomic density matrix with taking into account the recoil effects caused by the interaction of atoms with the laser field. An efficient method for solving the quantum kinetic equation is proposed. It is shown that the steady-state solution describing the atoms in the MOT has a significantly non-equilibrium nature and can be described within the framework of a two-temperature distribution. The momentum distribution of cold atoms in the MOT depends on the magnetic field gradient and, in general, significantly differs from the momentum distribution of atoms in the optical molasses, which is usually used as an approximation to describe the MOT. We have also shown that with an increase in the magnetic field gradient, a spatial two-component distribution of atoms in the trap is formed even for a single particle approximation when interatomic interactions are neglected.</description>

      <title>Single-Beam Magneto-Optical Trap in Back-to-Back Pyramidal and Conical Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), as an efficient method of producing cold atoms from room-temperature atomic vapor, has been widely used to develop atomic sensors. Various compact MOTs using a single laser beam have been reported, simplifying apparatuses and leading to miniaturized devices. Here, we propose single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back pyramidal and conical mirrors. In such back-to-back mirrors, a MOT trapping volume is formed by an incident laser beam, a retroreflected beam, and multiple reflections from the mirror surfaces. We present the design of back-to-back mirrors and a series of compact MOT configurations, with the potential of increasing access to the MOT and simultaneously creating multiple MOTs. We demonstrate a MOT in a back-to-back conical mirror, loading 10 million rubidium-87 atoms from background vapor and cooling the atoms to 7 {\mu}K using polarization gradients. Single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back mirrors will contribute to building compact and scalable cold-atom-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Atomic Charge State and Atomic Number for VAMOS++ Magnetic Spectrometer using Deep Neural Networks and Fractionally Labelled Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is a multi-parametric system that integrates ion optical magnetic elements with a multi-detector stack. The magnetic elements, along with the tracking and timing detectors and the trajectory reconstruction method, provide the analysis of the magnetic rigidity, the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer, and the related velocity and mass-over-charge ratio. The segmented ionization chamber provides the energy measurements necessary to analyze the atomic charge state and atomic number. However, this analysis critically suffers from inherent limitations due to the variable thickness and non-uniformity of the entrance window of the ionization chamber and other detector imperfections. Conventionally, this meticulous, detailed analysis is exceptionally tedious, often requiring several months to complete. We present a novel method utilizing deep neural networks, trained on an experimental dataset with only a small fraction of precisely labeled events for the lowest and best-resolved atomic charge states or numbers. This innovative approach enables the networks to autonomously and accurately classify the remaining events. This method drastically accelerates the acquisition of high-resolution atomic charge state and atomic number spectra, reducing analysis time from months to mere hours. Crucially, by discarding human bias, this approach ensures standardized, optimal, and reproducible results with unprecedented efficiency.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of deuterium's enhanced sensitivity to symmetry violations governed by the Standard-Model Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed hyperfine spectroscopy of two transitions in ground-state deuterium and searched for violations of \CPT and Lorentz symmetry that would manifest as sidereal variations of the observed transition frequencies. Several non-relativistic proton coefficients of the Standard-Model Extension framework have been addressed. The spin-independent coefficients with momentum power $k$=2,4 are constrained for the first time. Bounds on spin-dependent coefficients are improved by exploiting a sensitivity enhancement originating from the relative momenta of the nucleons in the deuteron. The best previous constraints by hydrogen maser measurements are surpassed by 4 and 14 orders of magnitude for coefficients with $k$=2 and 4, respectively. Furthermore, we find a deuterium zero-field hyperfine splitting of \SI{327.3843549(0.0000028)}{\mega \hertz}. This is in agreement with the literature and presents the most precise in-beam measurement of this quantity.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Lanthanide Atomic Data for Kilonova Radiative Transfer. I. Atomic Structure and Opacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early spectra of the kilonova (KN) AT2017gfo following the binary neutron star merger GW170817 exhibit numerous features shaped by r-process nucleosynthesis products. Although a few species were tentatively detected, no third-peak elements were unambiguously identified, as the amount of atomic data required for radiative transfer modeling is immense. Although comprehensive atomic data, including atomic opacities, is now available for many elements, wavelength-calibrated data remains limited to a select few ions. To examine the atomic opacities of all singly and doubly ionized lanthanides, from La (Z = 57) to Yb (Z = 70), we perform atomic structure calculations using the FAC code. Our calculations incorporate an innovative optimization of the local central potential and the number of configurations considered, alongside a calibration technique aimed at enhancing agreement between theoretical and experimental atomic energy levels. We assess the accuracy of the computed data, including energy levels and electric dipole (E1) transition strengths, as well as their impact on KN opacities. We find that strong transitions ($\log(gf)&gt;-1$) are in good agreement with both experiments and semi-empirical calculations. For ions with substantial experimental data, the computed opacities exhibit good agreement with prior calculations. By calibrating low-lying energy levels with experimental data, we have identified 66,591 transitions with experimentally calibrated wavelength information, rendering future lanthanide line identifications through radiative transfer modeling feasible. In total, our calculations encompass 28 ions, yielding 146,856 energy levels below the ionization threshold and 28,690,443 transitions among these levels.</description>

      <title>Electron Ptychography Reveals Correlated Lattice Vibrations at Atomic Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an electron ptychography reconstruction framework, CAVIAR -- Correlated Atomic Vibration Imaging with sub-Angstrom Resolution -- that reveals an entirely new channel of information: spatial correlations in atomic displacements at the atomic scale. We show reconstructions of a symmetric $\Sigma$9 grain boundary in silicon from realistically simulated data and experimental data for hexagonal boron nitride. By reconstructing the object as an ensemble of multiple states we are able to observe correlations between movements of atoms in the range of 10-20 pm at room temperature in agreement with the expectation. Moreover, using only the masses of the atomic species and the temperature as input, we obtain average frequencies of $10.8\pm0.1$, $13.6\pm0.6$, $18.0\pm0.2$, $25.5\pm1.5$ THz for the longitudinal and transversal acoustic and optic phonons, respectively, in agreement with inelastic neutron scattering, albeit from just a few nm$^3$ volume. This ability to spatially resolve correlated atomic motion makes CAVIAR a unique tool to explore atom dynamics at the finest scale with the potential to be instrumental in the development of phononic devices, in studying phonon-based decoherence in quantum systems, or other emerging phonon-based applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Linearities In Atomic Quantum Receivers: Harmonic And Intermodulation Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</description>

      <title>Simulation of STIRAP from the 1S to the 2S states of the Hydrogen/Antihydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving a high population of antihydrogen/hydrogen atoms in the 2S level is essential for spectroscopy measurements testing similarities between matter and antimatter. We propose and examine the efficiency of applying the STIRAP (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) process in achieving high population transfer from the 1S to the 2S levels. We utilized a circularly polarized Lyman alpha, Ly-$\alpha$, pulse to couple the 1S state to the 2P state and a microwave pulse to couple the 2P state and the 2S state. We calculate the efficiency of the STIRAP process for transferring the population between the stretched states $(1S_d, 2S_d)$ as a function of experimental parameters such as Rabi frequencies and pulse durations. We find that a Ly-$\alpha$ pulse with an energy of a few nanojoules could produce nearly perfect transfer at zero detunings for atoms on the laser beam axis. We extended the analysis to a thermal ensemble of atoms, where Doppler detuning affects the velocity distribution of the hydrogen atoms produced in the 2S level. We found that the width of such velocity distribution is controlled by the Rabi frequency. We show that the peak velocity of the hydrogen atoms in the 2S level after STIRAP can be controlled by the Ly-$\alpha$ pulse detuning. The efficiency of STIRAP in transferring population increases at low temperature (T$\sim$1~mK). Finally, we show that a background magnetic field improves the transfer rates between the other trappable states $(1S_c, 2S_c)$.</description>

      <title>Efficient direct loading of the green MOT of Yb with low green laser power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the direct loading of Yb atoms in the magneto-optical trap (MOT) using the intercombination narrow optical transition 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ 6s6p $^3$P$_1$ at 556 nm (green), known as green MOT with limited power of green laser, 10 mW. Direct loading of the green MOT is achieved by superimposing the green laser beam, inside a hollow core of the laser beam driving the broad 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ 6s6p $^1$P$_1$, transition (blue) at 399 nm. We load up to 3$\times10^8$ in $1$ s. We characterize the green MOT loading with various experimental parameters such as magnetic field gradient, power of the green laser and blue MOT laser, and detuning of the green laser. We have also loaded the green MOT using center-shifted dual MOT configuration. In this configuration, the overlap region of the three counter-propagating blue laser beams is shifted towards Zeeman slower, where the magnetic field is non-zero. The atoms are first pre-cooled and partially trapped in blue MOT. These atoms enter the green MOT region and are trapped. In this method, we do not lose power (unlike in core-shell MOT) of the blue MOT laser because of masking the central portion. However, we load only 10$^7$ atoms, which has one order of magnitude fewer atoms than in the core-shell MOT.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unraveling superradiance: Entanglement and mutual information in collective decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</description>
