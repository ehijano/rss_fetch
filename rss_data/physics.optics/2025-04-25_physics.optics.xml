      <title>Micro-Transfer Printed Continuous-Wave and Mode-Locked Laser Integration at 800 nm on a Silicon Nitride Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), optical atomic clocks, and quantum computing require photonic integration of (near-)visible laser sources to enable commercialization at scale. The heterogeneous integration of III-V optical gain materials with low-loss silicon nitride waveguides enables complex photonic circuits with low-noise lasers on a single chip. Previous such demonstrations are mostly geared towards telecommunication wavelengths. At shorter wavelengths, limited options exist for efficient light coupling between III-V and silicon nitride waveguides. Recent advances in wafer-bonded devices at these wavelengths require complex coupling structures and suffer from poor heat dissipation. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate a wafer-scale micro-transfer printing method integrating functional III-V devices directly onto the silicon substrate of a commercial silicon nitride platform. We show butt-coupling of efficient GaAs-based amplifiers operating at 800 nm with integrated saturable absorbers to silicon nitride cavities. This resulted in extended-cavity continuous-wave and mode-locked lasers generating pulse trains with repetition rates ranging from 3.2 to 9.2 GHz and excellent passive stability with a fundamental radio-frequency linewidth of 519 Hz. These results show the potential to build complex, high-performance fully-integrated laser systems at 800 nm using scalable manufacturing, promising advances for AR/VR, nonlinear photonics, timekeeping, quantum computing, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided and fabrication-aware inverse design of photonic devices using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.</description>

      <title>Single-mode InAs/GaAs quantum-dot DFB laser with oxidized aperture confined surface grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) distributed feedback (DFB) lasers are promising candidates for next-generation photonic integrated circuits. We present a design that incorporates an oxidized aperture confined surface grating (OASG) structure, which reduces non-radiative recombination losses and surface optical losses sustained in device fabricated by conventionally fabrication methods including etching and regrowth. The OASG-DFB laser eliminates the need for ridge waveguide etching and avoids instability in sidewall grating coupling. Experimental results show stable single-mode operation, a maximum output power of 15.1 mW, a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 44 dB, and a narrow linewidth of 1.79 MHz. This approach simplifies fabrication, reduces costs, and enhances the scalability of GaAs-based QD DFB lasers for applications in optical communication and photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Bridging Optical Sensing and Wearable Health Monitoring: A Functionalized Plasmonic Nanopillar for Non-Invasive Sweat Glucose Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is vital for diabetes care, but current systems rely on invasive implants or electrochemical sensors that often cause discomfort and skin irritation. Non-invasive alternatives remain limited by low sensitivity and poor compatibility with complex sweat environments, highlighting the urgent need for a comfortable and reliable solution. Here, we report the development of a wearable optical sensor watch that integrates surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology with a functionalized silver-coated silicon nanowire (Ag/SiNW) substrate for real-time, non-invasive glucose monitoring in sweat. The nanostructured sensor is functionalized with 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA), enabling selective glucose capture and optical signal transduction through both Raman scattering and SPR shift. The dual-mode detection strategy was systematically optimized, and a miniaturized SPR system operating at 638 nm was successfully integrated into a wearable watch format with wireless data transmission to a mobile application. This wearable device demonstrated excellent sensitivity (LOD down to 0.12 mM) and high selectivity in detecting glucose within physiological sweat concentration ranges. Human subject trials confirmed its applicability in real-life scenarios. This study offers a promising non-invasive alternative to traditional CGM and highlights the potential of integrating nanophotonic sensors with wearable platforms for continuous health monitoring and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Metasurfaces for Wavefront Restoration in Under-Display Camera Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under-display camera (UDC) systems enable full-screen displays in smartphones by embedding the camera beneath the display panel, eliminating the need for notches or punch holes. However, the periodic pixel structures of display panels introduce significant optical diffraction effects, leading to imaging artifacts and degraded visual quality. Conventional approaches to mitigate these distortions, such as deep learning-based image reconstruction, are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications in consumer electronics. This work introduces an inverse-designed metasurface for wavefront restoration, addressing diffraction-induced distortions without relying on external software processing. The proposed metasurface effectively suppresses higher-order diffraction modes caused by the metallic pixel structures, restores the optical wavefront, and enhances imaging quality across multiple wavelengths. By eliminating the need for software-based post-processing, our approach establishes a scalable, real-time optical solution for diffraction management in UDC systems. This advancement paves the way to achieve software-free real-time image restoration frameworks for many industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Continuous coherent perfect absorption and lasing at an exceptional point of anti-parity-time symmetric photonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a type of hypothetical compound materials in which its refractive index in spatial distribution meet $n(-x)=-n^{*}(x)$, belonging to anti-parity-time (APT) symmetric structures. Additionally, we demand balanced real positive- and negative- permeabilities with $\mu(-x)=-\mu(x)$. By introducing parametrization into APT symmetric transfer matrix, together with reciprocity theorem, we propose a generic parametric space to display its associated scattering results including symmetry phase, exceptional point, and symmetry broken phase. The outcome is irrespective of any system complexity, geometries, materials, and operating frequency. With the parametric space, we find that APT symmetric system not only enables coherent perfect absorption or lasing occurred at an exceptional point, but also realize a simultaneous coherent perfect absorption-lasing. Since APT-symmetric system is constructed by balanced positive and negative index materials, the phase accumulated from optical path length is null, resulting in an assignment of mode order lost. To verify our analysis, several designed heterostructures are demonstrated to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Effective Rabi frequency in semiconductor lasers and the origin of self-starting harmonic frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs have become a key research topic in optics and photonics. A peculiar comb state is the harmonic frequency comb (HFC), where optical lines are spaced by integer multiples of the cavity's free-spectral range. The spontaneous formation of HFCs has recently been observed in semiconductor lasers with fast gain recovery, such as Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs), although the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we provide a physical interpretation for the formation of HFCs in QCLs, based on a resonance phenomenon between an effective Rabi frequency and a mode of the laser cavity. This is corroborated by the results of the numerical integration of the effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations used to describe the multimode laser dynamics, as well as by the linear stability analysis of the continuous wave emission at threshold.</description>

      <title>A compact laser-plasma source for high-repetition-rate bi-modal X-ray and electron imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright sources of high-energy X-rays and electrons are indispensable tools in advanced imaging. Yet, current laser-driven systems typically support only single-modality imaging, require complex infrastructure, or operate at low repetition rates. Here, we demonstrate a compact, table-top laser-plasma source capable of generating synchronized electron and X-ray pulses at 1 kHz using just 2 mJ per pulse. A structured methanol droplet target enables quasi-single-shot electron radiographs and broadband, energy-resolved X-ray images, facilitating bi-modal imaging of both metallic and biological specimens. We achieve resolutions of 13.6 um for electrons and 21 um for X-rays, and demonstrate tomographic reconstruction using 35 projections. This compact platform rivals large-scale petawatt systems in resolution and brightness, while remaining scalable and accessible for high-throughput imaging in materials science and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>All-dielectric Metaphotonics for Advanced THz Control of Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While nearly single cycle THz pulse is conventionally accepted as the stimulus for the fastest and the most energy efficient control of spins in magnets, all-dielectric metasurfaces have been recently demonstrated to be the least dissipative mean to enhance and control the coupling of light to spins. All-dielectric metasurfaces for the THz control of spins hold great potential in the field of spintronics and related technologies, pushing the boundaries of speed and energy efficiency in spin-based information processing. Here we demonstrate such a metasurface for an advanced THz control of spins in a ferrimagnetic film of iron garnet. Structuring a nonmagnetic substrate one can force a THz electromagnetic field, otherwise described by plane waves, to acquire an out-of-plane magnetic field and thus enable arbitrary direction of the torque acting on spins in all three dimensions. Hence, metaphotonics opens up a plethora of opportunities for advanced control of spins at THz rates in many hot fields of contemporary science, including spintronics, magnonics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Reverse energy flows: the physical mechanism underling dramatic drop of loss in hollow-core fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hollow-core fibers (HCFs) with claddings composed of silica glass capillaries have recently attracted a great deal of attention following the demonstration of optical loss levels lower than those of conventional telecommunication fibers. It is well established already that optical losses in HCFs are highly sensitive to both the wavelength and the geometry of the cladding capillaries. The underlying physical mechanisms behind reducing loss with the change of HCF design parameters while keeping the same fiber structure are not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the relationship between light localization and corresponding decrease of losses in HCFs and the distribution of reverse energy fluxes in air-core modes. We show here that the shape of the capillaries plays a crucial role in controlling radial energy backflows that influence light confinement and the energy leakage from air-core modes of HCFs. Through numerical modeling, we demonstrate that optimizing the capillary geometry to tailor the distribution of reverse radial energy fluxes leads to a substantial reduction in transmission losses even in fibers with relatively simple cladding structures. Consideration of the energy flows and observed occurrences of vortex of the Poynting vector allows us to a draw an interesting interdisciplinary analogy with the hydrodynamical system with suppressed backward flow - Tesla valve. We believe that combination of singular optics and energy fluxes analysis provides valuable physical insight into the mechanisms governing waveguiding in HCFs offering a pathway toward novel designs with minimized leakage loss.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate modelling of Kerr-Brillouin combs in Fabry-Perot resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new mean-field equation for modeling Fabry-Perot resonators filled with a dispersive medium exhibiting both Brillouin and Kerr nonlinearities, e.g. an optical fiber. This model is derived from a unified framework that accounts for Brillouin scattering and four-wave mixing. It involves two coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations for the forward and backward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic oscillation. Under standard assumptions for mean-field models -such as high finesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion- we demonstrate that our equation closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant mathematical structure of our model provides valuable physical insights. As a key example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic perturbations of steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and accurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods. We highlight the effectiveness of this approach by simulating frequency comb generation in state-of-the-art high-Q fiber Fabry-Perot resonators.</description>

      <title>Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems focuses on the single-excitation regime. In one relevant example, the combination of multiple excited states and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, albeit with dispersion relations that can exhibit divergences near the light cone. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the divergences can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</description>

      <title>Invasion depth estimation of gastric cancer in early stage using circularly polarized light scattering: Phantom studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depolarization of circularly polarized light due to multiple scattering in turbid media provides size distributions of scatterer. Applied it to the biological tissues as turbid media, scatters correspond to cell nuclei, which is abnormally grown in cancerous tissues. Therefore, the invasion depth of early-staged cancer can be estimated by comparisons of circular polarization of scattered light. In this study, we fabricated the optical phantoms made of resin and polystyrene beads to verify this technique by systematic experiments. The single-layered phantoms containing only one size of beads exhibits uniform monodispersed scattering media. Polarization images taken by a circular polarization imaging camera show systematically changes to the numerical density of scatters. Healthy and cancerous tissue phantoms exhibiting the lengths of mean free paths close to actual biological tissues were stacked to be bi-layered phantoms which imitates early-staged cancers. The averaged circular polarization values obtained from the images captured with the polarization camera are indicative of obvious changes depending on the thickness of cancerous layer of phantoms.</description>

      <title>3D Deep-learning-based Segmentation of Human Skin Sweat Glands and Their 3D Morphological Response to Temperature Variations</title>

Abstract: Skin, the primary regulator of heat exchange, relies on sweat glands for thermoregulation. Alterations in sweat gland morphology play a crucial role in various pathological conditions and clinical diagnoses. Current methods for observing sweat gland morphology are limited by their two-dimensional, in vitro, and destructive nature, underscoring the urgent need for real-time, non-invasive, quantifiable technologies. We proposed a novel three-dimensional (3D) transformer-based multi-object segmentation framework, integrating a sliding window approach, joint spatial-channel attention mechanism, and architectural heterogeneity between shallow and deep layers. Our proposed network enables precise 3D sweat gland segmentation from skin volume data captured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). For the first time, subtle variations of sweat gland 3D morphology in response to temperature changes, have been visualized and quantified. Our approach establishes a benchmark for normal sweat gland morphology and provides a real-time, non-invasive tool for quantifying 3D structural parameters. This enables the study of individual variability and pathological changes in sweat gland structure, advancing dermatological research and clinical applications, including thermoregulation and bromhidrosis treatment.</description>

      <title>Multipartite continuous-variable quantum nondemolition interaction and entanglement certification and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied quantum measurement procedures. Usually, such process involves the coupling of a single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that the relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by observing the probe system. Here, we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings among the signal and probe modes with ancillary modes prepared off-line in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed by homodyne detections and feedforward modulations. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for post-modulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Equilibrium Theory of Quantum Light-Matter Interaction in Cavities: Extended Systems and the Long Wavelength Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When light and matter interact strongly, the resulting hybrid system inherits properties from both constituents, allowing one to modify material behavior by engineering the surrounding electromagnetic environment. This concept underlies the emerging paradigm of cavity materials engineering, which aims at the control of material properties via tailored vacuum fluctuations of dark photonic environments. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging due to the combined complexity of extended electronic states and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here, we derive an effective, non-perturbative theory for low-dimensional crystals embedded in a Fabry-P\'erot resonator, within the long-wavelength limit. Our approach incorporates the multimode and dispersive nature of the cavity field and reduces it to an effective single-mode description by imposing the condition of negligible momentum transfer from light to matter. Importantly, the resulting effective mode is characterized by a finite mode volume-even in the limit of extended cavities-which is directly linked to realistic cavity parameters. This ensures that the light-matter coupling remains finite in bulk systems. By explicitly accounting for the finite reflectivity of cavity mirrors, our theory also avoids double counting the contribution from free-space light-matter coupling. Overall, our results provide a robust and realistic framework for describing cavity-matter interactions at the Hamiltonian level, incorporating the electromagnetic environment beyond the idealized perfect-mirror approximation.</description>

      <title>Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with asymmetric sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which eliminates all the attacks from the eavesdropper to the measurement party, has been one of the most promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the performance when any two MDI users in networks communicates using asymmetric sources in distinct single or multiple temporal modes. As a specific application, we model to obtain the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare the performance to the cases with symmetric (i.e. identical) sources. The result demonstrates that the actual performance does not degrade due to the asymmetry of sources. In contrary, it maintains at a good level over the entire distance we study. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources, and thus paving the way for the practical deployment of completely asymmetric MDI-QKD networks.</description>
