      <title>Two-point stress approximation: A simple and robust finite volume method for linearized (poro-)mechanics and Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a simple and robust finite volume discretization for linearized mechanics, Stokes and poromechanics, based only on co-located, cell-centered variables. The discretization has a minimal stencil, using only the two neighboring cells to a face to calculate numerical stresses and fluxes.
  We fully justify the method theoretically in terms of stability and convergence, both of which are robust in terms of the material parameters. Numerical experiments support the theoretical results, and shed light on grid families not explicitly treated by the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Transport based particle methods for the Fokker-Planck-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a particle method for numerically solving the Landau equation, inspired by the score-based transport modeling (SBTM) method for the Fokker-Planck equation. This method can preserve some important physical properties of the Landau equation, such as the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and decay of estimated entropy. We prove that matching the gradient of the logarithm of the approximate solution is enough to recover the true solution to the Landau equation with Maxwellian molecules. Several numerical experiments in low and moderately high dimensions are performed, with particular emphasis on comparing the proposed method with the traditional particle or blob method.</description>

      <title>Formulae and transformations for simplicial tensorial finite elements via polytopal templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified method for constructing the basis functions of a wide variety of partially continuous tensor-valued finite elements on simplices using polytopal templates. These finite element spaces are essential for achieving well-posed discretisations of mixed formulations of partial differential equations that involve tensor-valued functions, such as the Hellinger-Reissner formulation of linear elasticity. In our proposed polytopal template method, the basis functions are constructed from template tensors associated with the geometric polytopes (vertices, edges, faces etc.) of the reference simplex and any scalar-valued $H^1$-conforming finite element space. From this starting point we can construct the Regge, Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson, Pechstein-Sch\"oberl, Hu-Zhang, Hu-Ma-Sun and Gopalakrishnan-Lederer-Sch\"oberl elements. Because the Hu-Zhang element and the Hu-Ma-Sun element cannot be mapped from the reference simplex to a physical simplex via standard double Piola mappings, we also demonstrate that the polytopal template tensors can be used to define a consistent mapping from a reference simplex even to a non-affine simplex in the physical mesh. Finally, we discuss the implications of element regularity with two numerical examples for the Reissner-Mindlin plate problem.</description>

      <title>The fast committor machine: Interpretable prediction with kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of stochastic dynamics, the committor function describes the probability that a process starting from an initial configuration $x$ will reach set $A$ before set $B$. This paper introduces a fast and interpretable method for approximating the committor, called the "fast committor machine" (FCM). The FCM is based on simulated trajectory data, and it uses this data to train a kernel model. The FCM identifies low-dimensional subspaces that optimally describe the $A$ to $B$ transitions, and the subspaces are emphasized in the kernel model. The FCM uses randomized numerical linear algebra to train the model with runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points. This paper applies the FCM to example systems including the alanine dipeptide miniprotein: in these experiments, the FCM is generally more accurate and trains more quickly than a neural network with a similar number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Randomized Symplectic Model Order Reduction for Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving high-dimensional dynamical systems in multi-query or real-time applications requires efficient surrogate modelling techniques, as e.g., achieved via model order reduction (MOR). If these systems are Hamiltonian systems their physical structure should be preserved during the reduction, which can be ensured by applying symplectic basis generation techniques such as the complex SVD (cSVD). Recently, randomized symplectic methods such as the randomized complex singular value decomposition (rcSVD) have been developed for a more efficient computation of symplectic bases that preserve the Hamiltonian structure during MOR. In the current paper, we present two error bounds for the rcSVD basis depending on the choice of hyperparameters and show that with a proper choice of hyperparameters, the projection error of rcSVD is at most a constant factor worse than the projection error of cSVD. We provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the efficiency of randomized symplectic basis generation and compare the bounds numerically.</description>

      <title>Convexification for a Coefficient Inverse Problem for a System of Two Coupled Nonlinear Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of two coupled nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations with two opposite directions of time is considered. In fact, this is the so-called "Mean Field Games System" (MFGS), which is derived in the mean field games (MFG) theory. This theory has numerous applications in social sciences. The topic of Coefficient Inverse Problems (CIPs) in the MFG theory is in its infant age, both in theory and computations. A numerical method for this CIP is developed. Convergence analysis ensures the global convergence of this method. Numerical experiments are presented.</description>

      <title>Local Time-Stepping for the Shallow Water Equations using CFL Optimized Forward-Backward Runge-Kutta Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is a well known, necessary condition for the stability of explicit time-stepping schemes that effectively places a limit on the size of the largest admittable time-step for a given problem. We formulate and present a new local time-stepping (LTS) scheme optimized, in the CFL sense, for the shallow water equations (SWEs). This new scheme, called FB-LTS, is based on the CFL optimized forward-backward Runge-Kutta schemes from Lilly et al. (2023). We show that FB-LTS maintains exact conservation of mass and absolute vorticity when applied to the TRiSK spatial discretization (Ringler et al., 2010), and provide numerical experiments showing that it retains the temporal order of the scheme on which it is based (second order). In terms of computational performance, we show that when applied to a real-world test case on a highly-variable resolution mesh, the MPAS-Ocean implementation of FB-LTS is up to 10 times faster than the classical four-stage, fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4), and 2.3 times faster than an existing strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta based LTS scheme (LTS3). Despite this significant increase in efficiency, the solutions produced by FB-LTS are qualitatively equivalent to those produced by both RK4 and LTS3.</description>

      <title>Resonances as a computational tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large toolbox of numerical schemes for dispersive equations has been established, based on different discretization techniques such as discretizing the variation-of-constants formula (e.g., exponential integrators) or splitting the full equation into a series of simpler subproblems (e.g., splitting methods). In many situations these classical schemes allow a precise and efficient approximation. This, however, drastically changes whenever non-smooth phenomena enter the scene such as for problems at low regularity and high oscillations. Classical schemes fail to capture the oscillatory nature of the solution, and this may lead to severe instabilities and loss of convergence. In this article we review a new class of resonance-based schemes. The key idea in the construction of the new schemes is to tackle and deeply embed the underlying nonlinear structure of resonances into the numerical discretization. As in the continuous case, these terms are central to structure preservation and offer the new schemes strong properties at low regularity.</description>

      <title>Numerical Recovery of the Diffusion Coefficient in Diffusion Equations from Terminal Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a numerical procedure for recovering a space-dependent diffusion coefficient in a (sub)diffusion model from the given terminal data, and provide a rigorous numerical analysis of the procedure. By exploiting decay behavior of the observation in time, we establish a novel H{\"o}lder type stability estimate for a large terminal time $T$. This is achieved by novel decay estimates of the (fractional) time derivative of the solution. To numerically recover the diffusion coefficient, we employ the standard output least-squares formulation with an $H^1(\Omega)$-seminorm penalty, and discretize the regularized problem by the Galerkin finite element method with continuous piecewise linear finite elements in space and backward Euler convolution quadrature in time. Further, we provide an error analysis of discrete approximations, and prove a convergence rate that matches the stability estimate. The derived $L^2(\Omega)$ error bound depends explicitly on the noise level, regularization parameter and discretization parameter(s), which gives a useful guideline of the \textsl{a priori} choice of discretization parameters with respect to the noise level in practical implementation. The error analysis is achieved using the conditional stability argument and discrete maximum-norm resolvent estimates. Several numerical experiments are also given to illustrate and complement the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>About the Burton-Miller factor in the low frequency region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burton-Miller method is a widely used approach in acoustics to enhance the stability of the boundary element method for exterior Helmholtz problems at so-called critical frequencies. This method depends on a coupling parameter $\eta$ and it can be shown that as long as $\eta$ has an imaginary part different from 0, the boundary integral formulation for the Helmholtz equation has a unique solution at all frequencies. A popular choice for this parameter is $\eta = \frac{\mathrm{i}}{k}$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. It can be shown that this choice is quasi optimal. However, especially in the low frequency region, where the critical frequencies are still sparsely distributed, different choices for this factor result in a smaller condition number and a smaller error of the solution. In this work, alternative choices for this factor are compared based on numerical experiments. Additionally, a way to enhance the Burton-Miller solution with $\eta = \frac{\mathrm{i}}{k}$ for a sound hard scatterer in the low frequency region by an additional step of a modified Richardson iteration is introduced.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on a mathematical model for water flow in porous media with competition between transport and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution deals with the mathematical modelling of fluid flow in porous media, in particular water flow in soils. The motivation is to describe the competition between gravity and capillarity, or, in other words, between transport and diffusion. The analysis is based on a mathematical model developed by B. Detmann, C. Gavioli, and P. Krej\v{c}\'i, in which the effects of gravity are included in a novel way. The model consists of a nonlinear partial differential equation describing both the gravitational transport and the capillary diffusion of water. Although analytical solutions can be obtained for some special cases, only numerical solutions are available in more general situations. The solving algorithm is based on a time discretisation and the finite element method, and is written in Matlab. The results of the numerical simulations are shown and the behaviour of the model is discussed.</description>

      <title>Randomized Householder QR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a randomized Householder QR factorization (RHQR). This factorization can be used to obtain a well conditioned basis of a set of vectors and thus can be employed in a variety of applications. The RHQR factorization of the input matrix $W$ is equivalent to the standard Householder QR factorization of matrix $\Psi W$, where $\Psi$ is a sketching matrix that can be obtained from any subspace embedding technique. For this reason, the RHQR algorithm can also be reconstructed from the Householder QR factorization of the sketched problem, yielding a single-synchronization randomized QR factorization (reconstructRHQR). In most contexts, left-looking RHQR requires a single synchronization per iteration, with half the computational cost of Householder QR, and a similar cost to Randomized Gram-Schmidt (RGS) overall. We discuss the usage of RHQR factorization in the Arnoldi process and then in GMRES, showing thus how it can be used in Krylov subspace methods to solve systems of linear equations. Based on Charles Sheffield's connection between Householder QR and Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS), a BLAS2-RGS is also derived.
  Numerical experiments show that RHQR produces a well conditioned basis whose sketch is numerically orthogonal even for the most difficult inputs, and an accurate factorization. The same results were observed with the high-dimensional operations made in half-precision. The reconstructed RHQR from the HQR factorization of the sketch was stabler than the standard Randomized Cholesky QR.

Abstract: In online learning, the data is provided in a sequential order, and the goal of the learner is to make online decisions to minimize overall regrets. This note is concerned with continuous-time models and algorithms for several online learning problems: online linear optimization, adversarial bandit, and adversarial linear bandit. For each problem, we extend the discrete-time algorithm to the continuous-time setting and provide a concise proof of the optimal regret bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with an extension of univariate Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind to the multivariate setting, where one chases best approximants to specific monomials by polynomials of lower degree relative to the uniform norm. Exploiting the Moment-SOS hierarchy, we devise a versatile semidefinite-programming-based procedure to compute such best approximants, as well as associated signatures. Applying this procedure in three variables leads to the values of best approximation errors for all mononials up to degree six on the euclidean ball, the simplex, and the cross-polytope. Furthermore, inspired by numerical experiments, we obtain explicit expressions for Chebyshev polynomials in two cases unresolved before, namely for the monomial $x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3$ on the euclidean ball and for the monomial $x_1^2 x_2 x_3$ on the simplex.</description>

      <title>Function Extrapolation with Neural Networks and Its Application for Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurately estimating a function on one domain when only its discrete samples are available on another domain. To answer this challenge, we utilize a neural network, which we train to incorporate prior knowledge of the function. In addition, by carefully analyzing the problem, we obtain a bound on the error over the extrapolation domain and define a condition number for this problem that quantifies the level of difficulty of the setup. Compared to other machine learning methods that provide time series prediction, such as transformers, our approach is suitable for setups where the interpolation and extrapolation regions are general subdomains and, in particular, manifolds. In addition, our construction leads to an improved loss function that helps us boost the accuracy and robustness of our neural network. We conduct comprehensive numerical tests and comparisons of our extrapolation versus standard methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform numerical investigation of nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations and Boussinesq system with a time-dependent fractional dimension. The dynamic change of the space dimension is proportional to the ratio R(t)/Z(t), where (R(t),Z(t)) is the position at which the maximum vorticity achieves its global maximum. This choice of space dimension is to ensure that the advection along the r-direction has the same scaling as that along the z-direction, thus preventing formation of two-scale solution structure. For the generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with solution dependent viscosity, we show that the solution develops a self-similar blowup with dimension equal to 3.188 and the self-similar profile satisfies the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity. We also study the nearly self-similar blowup of the axisymmetric Boussinesq system with constant viscosity. The generalized axisymmetric Boussinesq system preserves almost all the known properties of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations except for the conservation of angular momentum. We present convincing numerical evidence that the generalized axisymmetric Boussinesq system develops a stable nearly self-similar blowup solution with maximum vorticity increased by O(10^{30}).</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a new parameterized enhanced shift-splitting (PESS) preconditioner to solve the three-by-three block saddle point problem (SPP). Additionally, we introduce a local PESS (LPESS) preconditioner by relaxing the PESS preconditioner. Necessary and sufficient criteria are established for the convergence of the proposed PESS iterative process for any random initial guess. Furthermore, we meticulously investigate the spectral bounds of the PESS and LPESS preconditioned matrices. Moreover, empirical investigations have been performed for the sensitivity analysis of the proposed PESS preconditioner, which unveils its robustness. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the enhanced efficiency and robustness of the proposed PESS and LPESS preconditioners compared to the existing block diagonal and shift-splitting preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Bilinear optimal control for the Stokes-Brinkman equations: a priori and a posteriori error analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a bilinear optimal control problem for the Stokes--Brinkman equations: the control variable enters the state equations as a coefficient. In two- and three-dimensional Lipschitz domains, we perform a complete continuous analysis that includes the existence of solutions and first- and second-order optimality conditions. We also develop two finite element methods that differ fundamentally in whether the admissible control set is discretized or not. For each of the proposed methods, we perform a convergence analysis and derive a priori error estimates; the latter under the assumption that the domain is convex. Finally, assuming that the domain is Lipschitz, we develop an a posteriori error estimator for each discretization scheme and obtain a global reliability bound.</description>

      <title>Can Neural Networks learn Finite Elements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to construct a neural network for which the linear finite element approximation of a simple one dimensional boundary value problem is a minimum of the cost function to find out if the neural network is able to reproduce the finite element approximation. The deepest goal is to shed some light on the problems one encounters when trying to use neural networks to approximate partial differential equations</description>

      <title>A multigrid solver for PDE-constrained optimization with uncertain inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13680v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a collective multigrid algorithm to solve efficiently the large saddle-point systems of equations that typically arise in PDE-constrained optimization under uncertainty, and develop a novel convergence analysis of collective smoothers and collective two-level methods. The multigrid algorithm is based on a collective smoother that at each iteration sweeps over the nodes of the computational mesh, and solves a reduced saddle-point system whose size is proportional to the number $N$ of samples used to discretized the probability space. We show that this reduced system can be solved with optimal $O(N)$ complexity.
  The multigrid method is tested both as a stationary method and as a preconditioner for GMRES on three problems: a linear-quadratic problem, possibly with a local or a boundary control, for which the multigrid method is used to solve directly the linear optimality system; a nonsmooth problem with box constraints and $L^1$-norm penalization on the control, in which the multigrid scheme is used as an inner solver within a semismooth Newton iteration; a risk-averse problem with the smoothed CVaR risk measure where the multigrid method is called within a preconditioned Newton iteration. In all cases, the multigrid algorithm exhibits excellent performances and robustness with respect to the parameters of interest.</description>

      <title>High order unfitted finite element discretizations for explicit boundary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When modeling scientific and industrial problems, geometries are typically modeled by explicit boundary representations obtained from computer-aided design software. Unfitted (also known as embedded or immersed) finite element methods offer a significant advantage in dealing with complex geometries, eliminating the need for generating unstructured body-fitted meshes. However, current unfitted finite elements on nonlinear geometries are restricted to implicit (possibly high-order) level set geometries. In this work, we introduce a novel automatic computational pipeline to approximate solutions of partial differential equations on domains defined by explicit nonlinear boundary representations. For the geometrical discretization, we propose a novel algorithm to generate quadratures for the bulk and surface integration on nonlinear polytopes required to compute all the terms in unfitted finite element methods. The algorithm relies on a nonlinear triangulation of the boundary, a kd-tree refinement of the surface cells that simplify the nonlinear intersections of surface and background cells to simple cases that are diffeomorphically equivalent to linear intersections, robust polynomial root-finding algorithms and surface parameterization techniques. We prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm. We have successfully applied this algorithm to simulate partial differential equations with unfitted finite elements on nonlinear domains described by computer-aided design models, demonstrating the robustness of the geometric algorithm and showing high-order accuracy of the overall method.</description>

      <title>Noise-Tolerant Quantum Algorithm for Ground State Energy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is to simulate physical systems, leveraging their inherent quantum behavior to achieve an advantage over classical computation. In this work, we present a noise-tolerant Hamiltonian simulation algorithm for ground-state energy estimation. Our method surmounts stochastic sampling limitations to estimate expectation values. It is based on an adaptive sequence of fuzzy bisection searches to estimate the ground state energy digit by digit, with a trade-off between increasing the simulation time and decreasing the absolute error rate. It builds upon the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) algorithm, and it delivers good approximations in simulations with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to 1e-3, specifically for Hamiltonians that anti-commute with a Pauli string. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with different system Hamiltonians, system sizes, and time evolution encoding methods on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance with other existing methods and show that we can consistently achieve two to three orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.</description>
