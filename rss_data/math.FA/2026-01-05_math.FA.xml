      <title>Foguel-type operators similar to contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pisier's celebrated counterexample to Halmos's similarity-to-contractions problem was based on $2 \times 2$ upper triangular block operator matrices involving three classical operators: forward and backward shifts on the diagonal and Hankel operators in the off-diagonal entry. Together with another classical object, namely Toeplitz operators, one can formulate another $2^3 -1 = 7$ types of $2 \times 2$ upper triangular block operator matrices, which we refer to as Foguel-type operators. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of all the seven Foguel-type operators being similar to contractions.</description>

      <title>Random Frame Decompositions from Weighted Residual Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a positive operator under weighted residual maps determined by a finite family of orthogonal projections. Iterating these maps along the rooted tree of multi-indices produces a "weighted residual energy tree", together with natural path measures obtained by normalizing the dissipated energy or trace at each step. Under a quantitative coverage condition on the projections, we show that along almost every branch the residuals converge strongly to zero and the dissipated pieces admit a rank-one decomposition that reconstructs the initial operator. In the special case where the initial operator is the identity on a subspace, this yields almost surely a random Parseval frame generated intrinsically by the weighted residual dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear determination and phase retrieval under unimodular constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear determination problems in Hilbert spaces in which inner products are observed up to prescribed rotations in the complex plane. Given a Hilbert space $H$ and a subset $\Theta$ of the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$, we say that a system $\mathbf{G}\subseteq H$ does $\Theta$-phase retrieval ($\Theta$-PR) if for all $f,h\in H$ the condition that for every $g\in\mathbf{G}$ there exists $\theta_g\in\Theta$ with $\langle f,g\rangle=\theta_g\langle h,g\rangle$ forces $f=\theta h$ for some $\theta\in\Theta$. This framework unifies classical phase retrieval ($\Theta=\mathbb{T}$) and sign retrieval ($\Theta=\{1,-1\}$). For every countable $\Theta$ we give a complete characterization of $\Theta$-PR in terms of covers of $\mathbf{G}$ and geometric relations among vectors in the corresponding orthogonal complements, extending the complement-property characterization of Cahill, Casazza, and Daubechies. For cyclic phase sets we show that $\Theta$-PR is equivalent to the existence of specific second-order recurrence relations. We apply this to obtain a sharp lattice density criterion for $\Theta$-PR of exponential systems. For uncountable $\Theta$ we obtain a topological dichotomy in the Fourier determination setting, showing that $\Theta$-PR is characterized in terms of connectedness of $\Theta$. We further develop a M\"obius-invariant framework, proving that $\Theta$-PR is preserved under circle automorphisms and is governed by projective invariants such as the cross ratio. Finally, in $\mathbb{C}^d$ we determine sharp impossibility thresholds and prove that for countable $\Theta$ the property is generic once one passes the failure regime, yielding the minimal number of vectors required for $\Theta$-PR.</description>

      <title>Sharp lower bounds for generalized operator products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider general bilinear products defined by positive semidefinite matrices. Typically non-commutative, non-associative, and non-unital, these products preserve positivity and include the classical Hadamard, Kronecker, and convolutional products as special cases. We prove that every such product satisfies a sharp nonzero lower bound in the Loewner order, generalizing previous results of Vyb\'iral [Adv. Math., 2020] and Khare [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 2021] that were obtained in the special case of the Hadamard product. Our results naturally extend to Hilbert spaces for a family of products parametrized by positive trace-class operators, providing a lower bound in the Loewner order for such general products, including for the Hilbert tensor product.</description>

      <title>A note on weighted composition operators on Dirichlet space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide some sufficient conditions for the compactness of weighted composition operators on Dirichlet space. Furthermore, we characterize the numerical range of certain classes of weighted composition operators on Dirichlet space and establish the criteria that guarantee the inclusion of zero within the numerical range. Finally, several classes of weighted composition operators are introduced, whose numerical range contains either a circular disk with a given center and radius or an elliptical disk with specified foci and axis lengths.</description>

      <title>Completeness and reflexivity type properties of $B_1(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Tychonoff space $X$, $B_1(X)$ denotes the space of all Baire-one functions on $X$ endowed with the pointwise topology. We prove that the following assertions are equivalent: (1) $B_1(X)$ is a (semi-)Montel space, (2) $B_1(X)$ is a (semi-)reflexive space, (3) $B_1(X)$ is a (quasi-)complete space, (4) $B_1(X)=\mathbb{R}^X$, (5) $X$ is a $Q_f$-space. It is proved that $B_1(X)$ is sequentially complete iff $B_1(X)$ is locally complete iff $X$ is a $CZ$-space. In the case when $K$ is a compact space, we show that $B_1(K)$ is locally complete iff $K$ is scattered. We thoroughly study the case when $X$ is a separable metrizable space. Numerous distinguished examples are given.</description>

      <title>Beyond trace class -- Tensor products of Hilbert spaces and operator ideals in quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04627v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the meaning of the conjugate of a complex Hilbert space, including a related application of the theorem of Fr\'{e}chet-Riesz (by which an analysis of semilinear operators can be reduced to - linear - operator theory) to a revisit of applications of nuclear and absolutely $p$-summing operators in algebraic quantum field theory in the sense of Araki, Haag and Kastler ($p=2$) and more recently in the framework of general probabilistic spaces ($p=1$), we will outline that Banach operator ideals in the sense of Pietsch, or equivalently tensor products of Banach spaces in the sense of Grothendieck are even lurking in the foundations and philosophy of quantum physics and quantum information theory. In particular, we concentrate on their importance in algebraic quantum field theory. In doing so, we establish a canonical isometric isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces $H\otimes_2 (K \otimes_2 L)$ and $(H \otimes_2 K) \otimes_2 L$ (Theorem 3.8) and revisit the role of trace class operators.
  A few applications are specified, including the appropriateness of the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an implied Banach operator ideal representation of the tensor product of two complex Hilbert spaces $H \otimes_2 K$ (Proposition 3.4) and a purely linear algebraic description of the quantum teleportation process (Example 3.10).</description>

      <title>Order Continuous and Topological Representations of Archimedean Vector Lattices via $S(X)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02851v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arbitrary topological space $X$, assume that $S(X)$ is the vector lattice of all equivalence classes of real-valued continuous functions on open dense subsets of $X$; it is a laterally complete vector lattice but not a normed lattice, certainly. Nevertheless, we can have the extended unbounded norm topology ($un$-topology) on it. On the other hand, by a remarkable result of Wickstead, there exists a representation approach for every Archimedean vector lattice $E$ in terms of $S(X)$-spaces. In this paper, we show that this representation is order continuous and when $E$ is order complete, it coincides with the known Maeda-Ogasawara representation. Moreover, when $E$ is a Banach lattice, by consideration of the $un$-topology on $E$ and the extended $un$-topology on $S(X)$, we show that this representation is, in fact, a homeomorphism. With the aid of this topological attitude, we establish a representation theorem (in fact a homeomorphism) for the Fremlin projective tensor product between Banach lattices, in terms of $S(X)$-spaces, as well.</description>

      <title>Maximal inequalities for square functions and quantitative mean ergodic theorems associated to group metric measure spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish weighted strong and weak type inequalities for non-commutative square functions that naturally arise in the analysis of differences between ball averages and martingale sequences within the framework of group metric measure spaces. Then we use these maximal inequalities to prove a quantitative mean ergodic theorem. Our study extends classical harmonic analysis techniques to the non-commutative setting, revealing intricate interactions between group structures, operator-valued functions, and associated filtration systems.</description>

      <title>On some Fr\'echet spaces associated to the functions satisfying Mulholland inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we explore a new growth condition on Young functions, which we call Mulholland condition, pertaining to the mathematician H.P Mulholland, who studied these functions for the first time, albeit in a different context. We construct a non-trivial Young function $\Omega$ which satisfies Mulholland condition and $\Delta_2$-condition. We then associate exotic $F$-norms to the vector space $X_1\oplus X_2$, where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are Banach spaces, using the function $\Omega$. This $F$-spaces contains the Banach space $X_1$ and $X_2$ as a maximal Banach subspace. Further, the Banach envelope $(X_1\oplus X_2,||.||_{\Omega_o})$ of this $F$-space corresponds to the Young function $\Omega_o$ who characteristic function is an asymptotic line to the characteristic function of the Young function $\Omega$. Thus these $F$-spaces serves as "interpolation space" for Banach spaces $X_1$ and $(X_1\oplus X_2, ||.||_{\Omega_o})$ in some sense. These $F$-space are well behaved in regards to Hahn-Banach extension property, which is lacking in classical $F$-spaces like $L^p$ and $H^p$ for $0&lt;p&lt;1$. Towards the end, some direct sums for Orlicz spaces are discussed.</description>

      <title>A second microlocalization for the three-body calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series studying the quantum mechanical three-body problem within a modern microlocal framework. The project aims to demonstrate how the Helmholtz operator is a Fredholm map between suitable anisotropic Hilbert spaces. Notably, we will consider decoupled indices that measure decay at the spatial infinity. Despite the problem's rich history, new phenomena arise under this approach, particularly regarding diffraction. The treatment of this involves the second microlocalization framework introduced by Vasy for the two-body Helmholtz operator, which does not directly extend to the three-body case. This paper will clarify this structure. We will construct an algebra of operators, referred to as the three-cone algebra, which serves as a 'converse perspective' to the second microlocalization. This algebra exhibits a scattering structure at one boundary face and a specific fibered structure (corresponding to the scattering-fibered structure for the three-body algebra) at another, which are connected by a fibered cone. We show that introducing suitable blow-ups at the fiber infinity allows us to modify the three-cone algebra only at the symbolic level, thereby constructing the desired second microlocalized algebra. The presence of variable orders will also be considered. Finally, we prove basic properties for the second microlocalized algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid information (energy) propagation in deep feature extractors is crucial to balance computational complexity versus expressiveness as a representation of the input. We prove an upper bound for the speed of energy propagation in a unified framework that covers different neural network models, both over Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. Additional structural information about the signal domain can be used to explicitly determine or improve the rate of decay. To illustrate this, we show global exponential energy decay for a range of 1) feature extractors with discrete-domain input signals, and 2) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via scattering over locally compact abelian (LCA) groups.</description>

      <title>The Angular Momentum Penrose Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Penrose inequality with angular momentum for asymptotically flat, axisymmetric vacuum initial data sets containing a stable marginally outer trapped surface. This inequality provides a lower bound for the ADM mass in terms of the area and angular momentum of the black hole horizon, with equality holding if and only if the initial data set corresponds to a slice of the Kerr spacetime. Our proof combines the Jang equation approach with the p-harmonic level set method. A key component of the analysis is a modified Hawking mass functional that incorporates angular momentum and exhibits monotonicity along the flow. We also establish the rigidity of the inequality using the Mars-Simon tensor.</description>

We establish the mapping properties of the Floquet transform operator defined in A^2(D) and derive a general formula connecting the Bergman kernel and projection of the domain D to a kernel and projection on the bounded periodic cell B. As an application, we prove, for Toeplitz operators T_a with doubly periodic symbols, a spectral band formula, which describes the spectrum and essential spectrum of T_a in terms of the spectra of a family of Toeplitz-type operators on the cell B. Technical challenges arise from the fact that double quasiperiodic boundary conditions have to be taken into account in the definitions of the spaces and operators on the periodic cell B. This requires novel operator theoretic tools, which are based on modifications of certain elliptic functions, e.g. the Weierstrass p-function.</description>
