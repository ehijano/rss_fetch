      <title>Entanglement kinetics in polymer melts are chemically specific</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of entanglement kinetics in polymer melts. We compare predictions of a recently developed constitutive equation for disentanglement to molecular dynamics simulations of both united-atom polyethylene and Kremer-Grest models for polymers in shear and extensional flow. We confirm that entanglements recover on the retraction timescale, rather than the reptation timescale. We find that the convective constraint release parameter $\beta$ is independent of molecular weight, but that it increases with the ratio of Kuhn length $b_K$ to packing length $p$ as $\beta\sim (b_K/p)^\alpha$, with an exponent $\alpha=1.9$, which may suggest that disentanglement rate correlates with an increase in the tube diameter. These results may help shed light on which polymers are more likely to undergo shear banding.</description>

      <title>Sequence disorder-induced first order phase transition in confined polyelectrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a statistical mechanical model of a generic flexible polyelectrolyte, comprised of identically charged monomers with long range electrostatic interactions, and short-range interactions quantified by a disorder field along the polymer contour sequence, which is randomly quenched. The free energy and the monomer density profile of the system for no electrolyte screening are calculated in the case of a system composed of two infinite plates with an intervening oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chain. We show that the effect of the contour sequence disorder mediated by short-range interactions leads to an enhanced localization of the polyelectrolyte chain and a first order phase transition at a critical value of the inter-surface spacing. This phase transition results in an abrupt change of the pressure from negative to positive values, effectively eliminating polyelectrolyte mediated bridging attraction.</description>

      <title>Activity-Induced Stiffness, Entanglement Network and Dynamic Slowdown in Unentangled Semidilute Polymer Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active polymers possess numerous unique properties that are quite different from those observed in the system of small active molecule due to the intricate interplay between their activity and topological constraints. This study focuses on the conformational changes induced by activity, impacting effective stiffness and crucially influencing entanglement and dynamics. When the two terminals of a linear chain undergo active modification through coupling to a high-temperature thermal bath, there is a substantial increase in chain size, indicating a notable enhancement in effective stiffness. Unlike in passive semiflexible chains where stiffness predominantly affects local bond angles, activity-induced stiffness manifests at the scale of tens of monomers. While activity raises the ambient temperature, it significantly decreases diffusion by over an order of magnitude. The slowdown of dynamics observed can be attributed to increased entanglement due to chain elongation.</description>

      <title>Emergent Mesoscale Correlations in Active Solids with Noisy Chiral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the linear response theory for an elastic solid composed of active Brownian particles with intrinsic individual chirality, deriving both a normal mode formulation and a continuum elastic formulation. Using this theory, we compute analytically the velocity correlations and energy spectra under different conditions, showing an excellent agreement with simulations. We generate the corresponding phase diagram, identifying chiral and achiral disordered regimes (for high chirality or noise levels), as well as chiral and achiral states with mesoscopic-range order (for low chirality and noise). The chiral ordered states display mesoscopic spatial correlations and oscillating time correlations, but no wave propagation. In the high chirality regime, we find a peak in the elastic energy spectrum that leads to a non-monotonic behavior with increasing noise strength that is consistent with the emergence of the `hammering' state recently identified in chiral glasses. Finally, we show numerically that our theory, despite its linear response nature, can be applied beyond the idealized homogeneous solid assumed in our derivations. Indeed, by increasing the level of activity, we show that it remains a good approximation of the system dynamics until just below the melting transition. In addition, we show that there is still an excellent agreement between our analytical results and simulations when we extend our results to heterogeneous solids composed of mixtures of active particles with different intrinsic chirality and noise levels. Our work provides a thorough analytical and numerical description of the emergent states in a densely packed system of chiral self-propelled Brownian disks, thus allowing a detailed understanding of the phases and dynamics identified in a minimal chiral active systems.</description>

      <title>Mixing in stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the mixing induced by a small swimming organism in a density stratified fluid. We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify mixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of potential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing mixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that the near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much larger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although still small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a homogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights the impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers cannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways through which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately contributing towards oceanic mixing.</description>

      <title>Thermal Preconditioning of Membrane Stress to Control the Shapes of Ultrathin Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the phospholipid bilayer membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles as a free-standing environment for the growth of membrane-integrated ultrathin phospholipid crystals possessing a variety of shapes with 6-fold symmetry. Crystal growth within vesicle membranes, where more elaborate shapes grow on larger vesicles is dominated by the bending energy of the membrane itself, creating a means to manipulate crystal morphology. Here we demonstrate how cooling rate preconditions the membrane tension before nucleation, in turn regulating nucleation and growth, and directing the morphology of crystals by the time they are large enough to be visualized. The crystals retain their shapes during further growth through the two phase region. Experiments demonstrate this behavior for single crystals growing within the membrane of each vesicle, ultimately comprising up to 13% of the vesicle area and length scales of up to 50 microns. A model for stress evolution, employing only physical property data, reveals how the competition between thermal membrane contraction and water diffusion from tensed vesicles produces a size- and time-dependence of the membrane tension as a result of cooling history. The tension, critical in the contribution of bending energy in the fluid membrane regions, in turn selects for crystal shape for vesicles of a given size. The model reveals unanticipated behaviors including a low steady state tension on small vesicles that allows compact domains to develop, rapid tension development on large vesicles producing flower-shaped domains, and a stress relaxation through water diffusion across the membrane with a time constant scaling as the square of the vesicle radius, consistent with measurable tensions only in the largest vesicles.</description>

      <title>Vortex reversal is a precursor of confined bacterial turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active turbulence, or chaotic self-organized collective motion, is often observed in concentrated suspensions of motile bacteria and other systems of self-propelled interacting agents. To date, there is no fundamental understanding of how geometrical confinement orchestrates active turbulence and alters its physical properties. Here, by combining large-scale experiments, computer modeling, and analytical theory, we have discovered a generic sequence of transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells of varying radii. With increasing the well's radius, we observed that persistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex pulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational modeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from the nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become unstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key experimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed equations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the universal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to various biological and synthetic active systems.</description>

      <title>Lipid Lateral Diffusion: Mechanisms and Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lateral diffusion of lipids within membrane is of paramount importance, serving as a central mechanism in numerous physiological processes including cell signaling, membrane trafficking, protein activity regulation, and energy transduction pathways. This review offers a comprehensive overview of lateral lipid diffusion in model biomembrane systems explored through the lens of neutron scattering techniques. We examine diverse models of lateral diffusion and explore the various factors influencing this fundamental process in membrane dynamics. Additionally, we offer a thorough summary of how different membrane-active compounds, including drugs, antioxidants, stimulants, and membrane proteins, affect lipid lateral diffusion. Our analysis unveils the intricate interplay between these additives and membranes, shedding light on their dynamic interactions. We elucidate that this interaction is governed by a complex combination of multiple factors including the physical state and charge of the membrane, the concentration of additives, the molecular architecture of the compounds, and their spatial distribution within the membrane. In conclusion, we briefly discuss the future directions and areas requiring further investigation in the realm of lateral lipid diffusion, highlighting the need to study more realistic membrane systems.</description>

      <title>Complex Smectic Phases in Polymer Grafted Shape-Uniform Cellulose Nano-Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of short chain grafting on the liquid crystalline (LC) ordering of nano-crystals is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained grafted nano-rod model. Monodisperse nano-rods, with aspect ratios typical of cellulose nano-crystals (CNCs) are grafted randomly with oligomers at different grafting densities. LC ordering depends non-trivially on grafting density as the effective nano-rod shape and softness is modified. Ungrafted rods exhibit Nematic and tilted Smectic-C phases. At 25\% grafting, the addition of a few side chains entirely suppresses Smectic order and instead a persistent Nematic phase is favoured. Intermediary grafting, around 50\%, results in a Nematic and the reappearance of tilted Smectic-F phases. Heavier grafting facilitates direct transitions to either Smectic-I with extreme tilt (75\%) or an un-tilted Smectic-B (100\%). Such behaviour falls outside of current hard or soft-rod descriptions of phase-transitions in rod-like LC systems and points to undiscovered LC behaviour in both shape-purified grafted/un-grafted CNCs.</description>

      <title>Cornerstones are the Key Stones: Using Interpretable Machine Learning to Probe the Clogging Process in 2D Granular Hoppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sudden arrest of flow by formation of a stable arch over an outlet is a unique and characteristic feature of granular materials. Previous work suggests that grains near the outlet randomly sample configurational flow microstates until a clog-causing flow microstate is reached. However, factors that lead to clogging remain elusive. Here we experimentally observe over 50,000 clogging events for a tridisperse mixture of quasi-2D circular grains, and utilize a variety of machine learning (ML) methods to search for predictive signatures of clogging microstates. This approach fares just modestly better than chance. Nevertheless, our analysis using linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) highlights the position of potential arch cornerstones as a key factor in clogging likelihood. We verify this experimentally by varying the position of a fixed (cornerstone) grain, and show that such a grain dictates the size of feasible flow-ending arches, and thus the time and mass of each flow. Positioning this grain correctly can even increase the ejected mass by over 50%. Our findings demonstrate that interpretable ML algorithms like SVMs can uncover meaningful physics even when their predictive power is below the standards of conventional ML practice.</description>

      <title>Anomalous behaviour of transport properties in a supercooled water-glycerol mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glycerol acts as a natural cryoprotectant by depressing the temperature of ice nucleation and slowing down the dynamics of water mixtures. In this work we characterize dynamics -- diffusion, viscosity, and hydrogen-bond dynamics -- as well as density anomaly and structure of water mixtures with 1\% to 50\% w/w glycerol at low temperatures via molecular dynamics simulations using all-atom and coarse-grained models. Simulations reveal distinct violations of the Stokes-Einsten relation in the low temperature regime for water and glycerol. Deviations are positive for water at all concentrations, and positive for glycerol in very dilute solutions but turning negative in concentrated ones. The all-atom and coarse-grained models reveal an unexpected crossover in the dynamics of the 1% and 10 % w/w glycerol at the lowest simulated temperatures. This crossover manifests in the diffusion coefficients of water and glycerol, as well as in the viscosity and lifetime of hydrogen-bonds in water. We interpret that the crossover originates on the opposing dependence with glycerol concentration of the two factors controlling the solution's slow-down: the increase in tetrahedrally coordinated water and the dynamics and clustering of the glycerol molecules. We anticipate that this dynamic crossover will also occur for solution of water with other polyols.</description>

      <title>Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulation on DNA Double Strand Breaks Induced by Hydrogen Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scar model to reproduce how double-strand breaks occur in the telomeric DNA damaged by the effect of the $\beta$-decay of tritium to helium. In this scar model, the two hydrogens bonded to the 5$^\prime$ carbon connecting the pent saccharides and phosphate are removed. Molecular dynamics simulations using the reactive force field are carried out for 10 cases for the telomeric DNA consisting of 16 base pairs (32 nucleotides). It results in double-strand breaks (DSBs) being observed for structures with more than 24 scars. For 16 scar cases, only single-strand breaks (SSB) are observed. Moreover, in the case of $\left\{16, 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0, 16 \right\},$ where only one of the strands had scars, SSB occurs only in the scarred strand. Secondly, in the $\left\{16, 8 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 8, 16 \right\}$ cases, DSBs occurs. Therefore, we conclude that the following conditions are necessary for DSBs:(i) Scars must occur on both the L and R strands. (ii) A large number of scars (24 or more) must occur in close proximity to each other.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Prediction of Glass Dynamics by Incorporating the Direction of Deviation from Equilibrium Positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the intricate relationship between the structure and dynamics in the context of the glass transition has been a persistent challenge. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal tool, offering novel pathways to predict dynamic behaviors from structural descriptors. Notably, recent research has highlighted that the distance between the initial particle positions between the equilibrium positions substantially enhances the prediction of glassy dynamics. However, these methodologies have been limited in their ability to capture the directional aspects of these deviations from the equilibrium positions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the complex particle interactions within the cage dynamics. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel structural parameter: the vectorial displacement of particles from their initial configuration to their equilibrium positions. Recognizing the inadequacy of current ML models in effectively handling such vectorial parameters, we have developed an Equivariance-Constrained Invariant Graph Neural Network (EIGNN). This innovative model not only bolsters the descriptive capacity of conventional rotation-invariant models but also streamlines the computational demands associated with rotation-equivariant graph neural networks. Our rigorous experimental validation on 3D glassy system from GlassBench dataset has yielded compelling evidence that the EIGNN model significantly enhance the correlation between structural representation and dynamic properties.</description>

Abstract: The paper continues to study the long-standing problem of quasi 1-D (one dimensional) spectrum of sea surface wave turbulence. The study is based on Hasselmann's kinetic equation, which significantly simplifies for the quasi 1-D turbulence. The goal of the paper is to compare the theoretical predictions with experimental observations. The paper starts with new derivation of the quasi 1-D approximation of Hasselmann's equation. The present work does not support the imposition of boundary conditions. Instead, the family of theoretical spectra is compared with P-M (Pierson-Moskowitz) and JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectra. First, a simple solution (first approximation) of the quasi 1-D equation is obtained and compared with the P-M spectrum. Then self-similar solutions are considered; they are shown to satisfy the second order ordinary differential equation. The solutions of this equation have many features of the JONSWAP spectra.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis Reveals the Key to Extracting Pair Potentials from Neutron Scattering Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse problem of statistical mechanics is an unsolved, century-old challenge to learn classical pair potentials directly from experimental scattering data. This problem was extensively investigated in the 20th century but was eventually eclipsed by standard methods of benchmarking pair potentials to macroscopic thermodynamic data. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that existing force field models fail to reliably reproduce fluid structures even in simple liquids, which can result in reduced transferability and substantial misrepresentations of thermophysical behavior and self-assembly. In this study, we revisited the structure inverse problem for a classical Mie fluid to determine to what extent experimental uncertainty in neutron scattering data influences the ability to recover classical pair potentials. Bayesian uncertainty quantification was used to show that structure factors with random noise smaller than 0.005 to $\sim30$ A$^{-1}$ are required to accurately recover pair potentials from neutron scattering. Notably, modern neutron instruments can achieve this precision to extract classical force models to within approximately $\pm$ 1.3 for the repulsive exponent, $\pm$ 0.068 A$^{-1}$ for atomic size, and 0.024 kcal/mol in the potential well-depth with 95\% confidence. Our results suggest the exciting possibility of improving molecular simulation accuracy through the incorporation of neutron scattering data, advancement in structural modeling, and extraction of model-independent measurements of local atomic forces in real fluids.</description>

      <title>Laminar-Turbulent Patterns in Shear Flows : Evasion of Tipping, Saddle-Loop Bifurcation and Log scaling of the Turbulent Fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a one-dimensional two-scalar fields reaction advection diffusion model for the globally subcritical transition to turbulence. In this model, the homogeneous turbulent state is disconnected from the laminar one and disappears in a tipping catastrophe scenario. The model however exhibits a linear instability of the turbulent homogeneous state, mimicking the onset of the laminar-turbulent patterns observed in the transitional regime of wall shear flows. Numerically continuing the solutions obtained at large Reynolds numbers, we construct the Busse balloon associated with the multistability of the nonlinear solutions emerging from the instability. In the core of the balloon, the turbulent fluctuations, encoded into a multiplicative noise, select the pattern wavelength. On the lower Reynolds number side of the balloon, the pattern follows a cascade of destabilizations towards larger and larger, eventually infinite wavelengths. In that limit, the periodic limit cycle associated with the spatial pattern hits the laminar fixed point, resulting in a saddle-loop global bifurcation and the emergence of solitary pulse solutions. This saddle-loop scenario predicts a logarithmic divergence of the wavelength, which captures experimental and numerical data in two representative shear flows.</description>

      <title>Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes thereupon remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Swirl Structures Powered by Microswimmers in Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active nematics, in their pure form, have demonstrated a plethora of dynamic and steady state behaviors, including large-scale dynamic structures, collective flows, and intricate multi-spatial temporal dynamics. This complexity further increases in the presence of external polar agents. We investigate active nematics interspersed with polar microswimmers, akin to active apolar cells infused with active impurities, microswimmers. Our comprehensive numerical study reveals that varying the microswimmers' motility induces a novel spatiotemporal state in the active nematics backdrop. This state is marked by macroscopic swirl-like structures and a reduction in the overall order of the active nematics. Interestingly, this state emerges at intermediate motility levels, where microswimmers form local clusters and exhibit coherent motion. However, at higher motility levels, the swirls become less coherent, and microswimmer clustering intensifies. We show that the effect of the polar microswimmers on active nematics can be interpreted as a spatiotemporally correlated colored noise on active nematics, which promotes bend instability in active nematics, leading to the observed swirling dynamics. Our findings indicate that the spatiotemporal states are highly sensitive to the microswimmers' motility, offering potential avenues for pathogen identification based on known motility characteristics</description>

      <title>Competing nucleation pathways in nanocrystal formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous efforts from numerical approaches to complement experimental measurements, several fundamental challenges have still hindered one's ability to truly provide an atomistic picture of the nucleation process in nanocrystals. Among them, our study resolves three obstacles: (1) Machine-learning force fields including long-range interactions able to capture the finesse of the underlying atomic interactions, (2) Data-driven characterization of the local ordering in a complex structural landscape associated with several crystal polymorphs and (3) Comparing results from a large range of temperatures using both brute-force and rare-event sampling. Altogether, our simulation strategy has allowed us to study zinc oxide crystallization from nano-droplet melt. Remarkably, our results show that different nucleation pathways compete depending on the investigated degree of supercooling.</description>

      <title>Foams with 3D Spatially Programmed Mechanics Enabled by Autonomous Active Learning on Viscous Thread Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foams are versatile by nature and ubiquitous in a wide range of applications, including padding, insulation, and acoustic dampening. Previous work established that foams 3D printed via Viscous Thread Printing (VTP) can in principle combine the flexibility of 3D printing with the mechanical properties of conventional foams. However, the generality of prior work is limited due to the lack of predictable process-property relationships. In this work, we utilize a self-driving lab that combines automated experimentation with machine learning to identify a processing subspace in which dimensionally consistent materials are produced using VTP with spatially programmable mechanical properties. In carrying out this process, we discover an underlying self-stabilizing characteristic of VTP layer thickness, an important feature for its extension to new materials and systems. Several complex exemplars are constructed to illustrate the newly enabled capabilities of foams produced via VTP, including 1D gradient rectangular slabs, 2D localized stiffness zones on an insole orthotic and living hinges, and programmed 3D deformation via a cable driven humanoid hand. Predictive mapping models are developed and validated for both thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and polylactic acid (PLA) filaments, suggesting the ability to train a model for any material suitable for material extrusion (ME) 3D printing.</description>

      <title>Curvature fluctuations of fluid vesicles reveal hydrodynamic dissipation within the bilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The biological function of membranes is closely related to their softness, which is often studied through the membranes' thermally-driven fluctuations. The analysis commonly assumes that the relaxation rate of a pure bending deformation is determined by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and viscous dissipation in the surrounding medium. Here, we reexamine this assumption and demonstrate that viscous flows within the membrane dominate the dynamics of bending fluctuations of non-planar membranes with a radius of curvature smaller than the Saffman-Delbr\"uck length. Using flickering spectroscopy of giant vesicles made of DPPC:Cholesterol mixtures and pure diblock-copolymer membranes, we experimentally detect the signature of membrane dissipation in curvature fluctuations, and show that membrane viscosity can be reliably obtained from the short time behavior of the shape time correlations. The results indicate that the DPPC:Cholesterol membranes behave as a Newtonian fluid, while polymer membranes exhibit more complex rheology. Our study provides physical insights into the time scales of curvature remodeling of biological and synthetic membranes.</description>

      <title>Basal force fluctuations and granular rheology: Linking macroscopic descriptions of granular flows to bed forces with implications for monitoring signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular flows are ubiquitous in nature with single flows traversing a wide range of dynamic conditions from initiation to deposition. Many of these flows are responsible for significant hazards and have the ability to generate remotely detectable seismic signals. These signals provide a potential for real-time flow measurements from a safe distance. To fully realize the benefit of seismic measurements, basal granular forces must be linked to macroscopic internal flow dynamics across a wide range of flow conditions. We utilize discrete element simulations to observe dry and submerged granular flows under plane-shear and inclined flow configurations, relating bulk kinematics to basal force distributions. We find that force fluctuations scale with non-dimensional shear-rate ($I$), and this scaling tracks three flow regimes that can be described by $\mu(I)$ rheology, as well as a fourth regime that marks a `phase change' from a liquid-like to a gas-like state: (1) an unsteady particle rearrangement regime when $I&lt;10^{-3}$, where basal forces are dominated by low frequencies; (2) an intermediate regime when $10^{-3}&lt; I&lt;10^{-2}$, where basal forces start to become noise-like, (3) a transitional regime at $10^{-2}&lt;I&lt;10^{-1}$, where the increase in basal tractions with increasing shear-rates stalls as the granular bed dilates, partially destroying the contact network and memory stored in the particle contact network, and (4) a fully collisional regime when $I&gt;10^{-1}$, where the signal is nearly flat up to a cutoff frequency. This effort suggests that basal forces can be used to interpret complex granular processes in geophysical flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled learning is a contrastive scheme for tuning the properties of individual elements within a network in order to achieve desired functionality of the system. It takes advantage of physics both to learn using local rules and to "compute" the output response to input data, thus enabling the system to perform decentralized computation without the need for a processor or external memory. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept mechanical network that can learn simple tasks such as self-symmetrizing via iterative tuning of individual spring rest lengths. These mechanical networks could feasibly be scaled and automated to solve increasingly complex tasks, hinting at a new class of smart metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic diffusion in apolar active suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active suspensions encompass a wide range of complex fluids containing microscale energy-injecting particles, such as cells, bacteria or artificially powered active colloids. Because they are intrinsically non-equilibrium, active suspensions can display a number of fascinating phenomena, including turbulent-like large-scale coherent motion and enhanced diffusion. Here, using a recently developed active Fast Stokesian Dynamics method, we present a detailed numerical study on the hydrodynamic diffusion in apolar active suspensions. Specifically, we simulate suspensions of active but non-self-propelling spherical squirmers, of either puller- or pusher-type, at volume fractions from 0.5% to 55%. Our results show little difference between pullers and pushers in their instantaneous and long-time dynamics, where the translational dynamics vary non-monotonically with the volume fraction, with a peak diffusivity at around 10% to 20%, in stark contrast to suspensions of self-propelling particles. On the other hand, the rotational dynamics tend to increase with the volume fraction as is the case for self-propelling particles. To explain these dynamics, we provide detailed scaling and statistical analyses based on the activity-induced hydrodynamic interactions and the observed microstructural correlations, which display a weak local order. Overall, these results elucidate and highlight the different effects of particle activity on the collective dynamics and transport phenomena in active fluids.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a disk in a thin film of weakly nematic fluid subject to linear friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To make progress towards the development of a theory on the motion of inclusions in thin structured films and membranes, we here consider as an initial step a circular disk in a two-dimensional, uniaxially anisotropic fluid layer. We assume overdamped dynamics, incompressibility of the fluid, and global alignment of the axis of anisotropy. Motion within this layer is affected by additional linear friction with the environment, for instance, a supporting substrate. We investigate the induced flows in the fluid when the disk is translated parallel or perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy. Moreover, expressions for corresponding mobilities and resistance coefficients of the disk are derived. Our results are obtained within the framework of a perturbative expansion in the parameters that quantify the anisotropy of the fluid. Good agreement is found for moderate anisotropy when compared to associated results from finite-element simulations. At pronounced anisotropy, the induced flow fields are still predicted qualitatively correctly by the perturbative theory, although quantitative deviations arise. We hope to stimulate with our investigations corresponding experimental analyses, for example, concerning fluid flows in anisotropic thin films on uniaxially rubbed supporting substrates.</description>

Abstract: Multicellular self-assembly into functional structures is a dynamic process that is critical in the development and diseases, including embryo development, organ formation, tumor invasion, and others. Being able to infer collective cell migratory dynamics from their static configuration is valuable for both understanding and predicting these complex processes. However, the identification of structural features that can indicate multicellular motion has been difficult, and existing metrics largely rely on physical instincts. Here we show that using a graph neural network (GNN), the motion of multicellular collectives can be inferred from a static snapshot of cell positions, in both experimental and synthetic datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>
