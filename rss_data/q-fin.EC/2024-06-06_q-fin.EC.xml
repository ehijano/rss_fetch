      <title>Evaluating Feature Selection Methods for Macro-Economic Forecasting, Applied for Inflation Indicator of Iran</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores various feature selection techniques applied to macro-economic forecasting, using Iran's World Bank Development Indicators. Employing a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) within a 10-fold cross-validation setup, this research systematically analyzes and ranks different feature selection methodologies. The study distinctly highlights the efficiency of Stepwise Selection, Tree-based methods, Hausdorff distance, Euclidean distance, and Mutual Information (MI) Score, noting their superior performance in reducing predictive errors. In contrast, methods like Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and Variance Thresholding showed relatively lower effectiveness. The results underline the robustness of similarity-based approaches, particularly Hausdorff and Euclidean distances, which consistently performed well across various datasets, achieving an average rank of 9.125 out of a range of tested methods. This paper provides crucial insights into the effectiveness of different feature selection methods, offering significant implications for enhancing the predictive accuracy of models used in economic analysis and planning. The findings advocate for the prioritization of stepwise and tree-based methods alongside similarity-based techniques for researchers and practitioners working with complex economic datasets.</description>

      <title>Views about ChatGPT: Are human decision making and human learning necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using individual-level survey data from 2024, this study investigated how respondent characteristics are associated with a subjective view of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). We asked 14 questions concerning respondents view about GAI, such as general view, faulty GAI, autonomous GEI, GAI replacing humans, and importance of human learning. Regression analysis based on the ordered logit model revealed that: (1) In some cases, the results of smartphone and computer usage times differed. Smartphone usage time was negatively correlated with the importance of human learning, whereas computer usage was not negatively correlated. (2) Managers and ordinary businesspeople have positive views of GAI. However, managers do not show a positive view about GAI being responsible for human decision making. (3) Teachers generally have a negative view about GAI replacing humans and no need of learning. They do not have negative views about GAI producing documents unless GAI is faulty. (4) Medical industry workers positively view GAI if it operates following their direction. However, they do not agree with the view that GAI replaces humans, and that human learning is unnecessary. (5) Females are less likely than men to have a positive view of GAI. In summary, views about GAI vary widely by the individual characteristics and condition of GAI, and by the question set.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Global Building Stocks by 2070: Unlocking Renovation Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buildings produce one-third of carbon emissions globally, however, data absence regarding global floorspace poses challenges in advancing building carbon neutrality. We compile the measured building stocks for 14 major economies and apply our global building stock model, GLOBUS, to evaluate future trends in stock turnover. Based on a scenario not considering renovation, by 2070 the building stock in developed economies will be ~1.4 times that of 2020 (100 billion m2); in developing economies it is expected to be 2.2 times that of 2020 (313 billion m2). Based on a techno-economic potential scenario, however, stocks in developed economies will decline to approximately 0.8 times the 2020 level, while stocks in developing economies will increase to nearly twice the 2020 level due to their fewer buildings currently. Overall, GLOBUS provides a way of calculating the global building stock, helping scientists, engineers, and policymakers conduct a range of investigation across various future scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the use of artificial intelligence in financial regulations and the impact on financial stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11293v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) can undermine financial stability because of malicious use, misinformation, misalignment, and the AI analytics market structure. The low frequency and uniqueness of financial crises, coupled with mutable and unclear objectives, frustrate machine learning. Even if the authorities prefer a conservative approach to AI adoption, it will likely become widely used by stealth, taking over increasingly high-level functions driven by significant cost efficiencies and superior performance. We propose six criteria for judging the suitability of AI.</description>

      <title>NFT Wash Trading: Direct vs. Indirect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies estimate around 70% of traded value on off-chain crypto exchanges like Binance is wash trading. This paper turns to NFT markets, where the on-chain nature of transactions-a key tenet of Web3 innovation-enables more direct estimation methods to be applied. Focusing on three of the largest NFT marketplaces, we find 30-40% of NFT volume and 25-95% of traded value involve wash trading. We leverage this direct approach to critically evaluate recent indirect estimation methods suggested in the literature, revealing major differences in effectiveness, with some failing altogether. Trade-roundedness filters, as suggested in Cong et al. (2023), emerge as the most accurate indirect estimation method. In fact, we show how direct and indirect approaches can be closely aligned via hyper-parameter fine-tuning. Our findings underscore the crucial role of technological innovation in detecting and regulating financial misconduct in digital finance.</description>

      <title>Distrust of social media influencers in America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The popularity of social media influencers (SMI) as a means for businesses and causes to engage with the public and develop followers is undeniable. However, the use of SMI have been scrutinized due to various scandals that reflect poorly on brands and firms. Consequently, the distrust of SMI can create the potential for damage to a brand if audiences are not receptive to communications and messaging. This study (n=351) shares insights and findings of the apparent distrust of SMI that were discovered during the data analysis phase of my dissertation (Berry, 2024a). The study examines levels of trust and distrust toward SMI in the United States according to various demographic characteristics of respondents, specifically, age, gender, income level, education level, and region of the United States. Chi square analysis of the variables and a predictive model of trust of SMI are presented. Finally, recommendations and suggestions for future research are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Model of Performative Human-ML Collaboration: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in various applications, from recommendation systems in e-commerce to diagnosis prediction in healthcare. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic framework for thinking about the deployment of ML models in a performative, human-ML collaborative system. In our framework, the introduction of ML recommendations changes the data generating process of human decisions, which are only a proxy to the ground truth and which are then used to train future versions of the model. We show that this dynamic process in principle can converge to different stable points, i.e. where the ML model and the Human+ML system have the same performance. Some of these stable points are suboptimal with respect to the actual ground truth. We conduct an empirical user study with 1,408 participants to showcase this process. In the study, humans solve instances of the knapsack problem with the help of machine learning predictions. This is an ideal setting because we can see how ML models learn to imitate human decisions and how this learning process converges to a stable point. We find that for many levels of ML performance, humans can improve the ML predictions to dynamically reach an equilibrium performance that is around 92% of the maximum knapsack value. We also find that the equilibrium performance could be even higher if humans rationally followed the ML recommendations. Finally, we test whether monetary incentives can increase the quality of human decisions, but we fail to find any positive effect. Our results have practical implications for the deployment of ML models in contexts where human decisions may deviate from the indisputable ground truth.</description>
