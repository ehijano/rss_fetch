      <title>Bernstein polynomials: a bibliometric data analysis since the year 1949 based on the Scopus database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It's hard to imagine human life in the digital and AI age without polynomials because they are everywhere but mostly invisible to ordinary people: in data trends, on computer screens, in the shapes around us, and in the very fabric of technology. One of these, the simple but elegant Bernstein polynomials, was discovered by a scientist from the Russian Empire, Sergei Bernstein, in 1912 and plays a central role in mathematical analysis, computational and applied mathematics, geometric modelling, computer-aided geometric design, computer graphics and other areas of science and engineering. They have been the sub-ject of much research for over a hundred years. However, no work has carried out database-derived research analysis, such as bibliometric, keyword or network analysis, or more generally, data analysis of manuscript data related to Bernstein polynomials extracted from digital academic databases. This work, which appears to be the first-ever attempt at the bibliometric data analysis of Bernstein polynomials, aims to fill this gap and open researchers' eyes to potentially new or underexplored areas of mathematics and engineering where Bernstein polynomials may one day be used to make discoveries. The results may be helpful to academics researching Bernstein polynomials and looking for potential applications, collaborators, supervisors, funding or journals to publish in.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility and Artifact Consistency of the SIGIR 2022 Recommender Systems Papers Based on Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based techniques relying on neural networks and embeddings have gained attention as a way to develop Recommender Systems (RS) with several papers on the topic presented at SIGIR 2022 and 2023. Given the importance of ensuring that published research is methodologically sound and reproducible, in this paper we analyze 10 graph-based RS papers, most of which were published at SIGIR 2022, and assess their impact on subsequent work published in SIGIR 2023. Our analysis reveals several critical points that require attention: (i) the prevalence of bad practices, such as erroneous data splits or information leakage between training and testing data, which call into question the validity of the results; (ii) frequent inconsistencies between the provided artifacts (source code and data) and their descriptions in the paper, causing uncertainty about what is actually being evaluated; and (iii) the preference for new or complex baselines that are weaker compared to simpler ones, creating the impression of continuous improvement even when, particularly for the Amazon-Book dataset, the state-of-the-art has significantly worsened. Due to these issues, we are unable to confirm the claims made in most of the papers we examined and attempted to reproduce.</description>

      <title>Automating Violence Detection and Categorization from Ancient Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violence descriptions in literature offer valuable insights for a wide range of research in the humanities. For historians, depictions of violence are of special interest for analyzing the societal dynamics surrounding large wars and individual conflicts of influential people. Harvesting data for violence research manually is laborious and time-consuming. This study is the first one to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in identifying violence in ancient texts and categorizing it across multiple dimensions. Our experiments identify LLMs as a valuable tool to scale up the accurate analysis of historical texts and show the effect of fine-tuning and data augmentation, yielding an F1-score of up to 0.93 for violence detection and 0.86 for fine-grained violence categorization.</description>
