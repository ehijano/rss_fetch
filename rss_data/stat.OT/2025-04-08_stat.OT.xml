      <title>Underreporting of Intimate Partner Violence in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05102</link>

Abstract: According to WHO (2013), in general 30% of all women worldwide who have been in a relationship have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner. However, only a small percentage of intimate partner violence (IPV) victims report it to the police. This phenomenon of under-reporting is known as ``dark figure''. This paper aims to investigate the factors associated with the reporting decision of IPV victims to the police in Brazil using the third wave of the ``Pesquisa de Condi\c{c}\~{o}es Socioecon\^{o}micas e Viol\^{e}ncia Dom\'{e}stica e Familiar contra a Mulher ($PCSVDF^{Mulher}$)''. Using a bivariate probit regression model with sample selection, we found that older white women, those who do not tolerate domestic violence, and women who have experienced physical violence are more likely to report IPV to the police. In contrast, married women, those with partners who abuse alcohol and those who witnessed or knew that their mothers had experienced IPV, are less likely to report it to law enforcement.</description>

      <title>My Statistics is Better than Yours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical schools-such as Bayesianism and Frequentism-are often presented as competing frameworks, each claiming technical rigour and superiority. Frequentism emphasizes objective inferences through repeated sampling, while Bayesianism incorporates prior beliefs and updates them with new evidence. Despite their strengths, neither school proves universally applicable, and the pursuit of a single "correct" statistical framework is ultimately misguided. Instead, this essay advocates for a context-dependent approach to statistical norms, drawing on Douglas (2004)'s concept of "operational objectivity". The idea is that by aligning the context of the research question with the value judgments inherent to its field, a certain statistical paradigm is warranted. This essay explores the decision-theoretic foundations of Bayesianism, examines its descriptive limitations as highlighted by the Ellsberg paradox, and addresses the challenges of comparing different normative systems.</description>
