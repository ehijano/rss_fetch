      <title>Evidence for multiple crossings and stripping of Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage across the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion of Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES) onto the Milky Way (MW) is one of the most prominent features of the Galactic halo revealed by the combination of the Gaia satellite and large spectroscopic surveys. This massive accretion largely contributes to the local stellar halo mass and was significant enough to alter the formation history and the morphology of the MW. In this work, we aim to analyse the selection of stars previously identified as belonging to GES with different kinematics and chemical properties to test the hypothesis of a two-phase accretion event. We apply several statistical tests to assess the significance of the separation between the two populations in GES. We then employ galactic chemical evolution models to investigate the origin of the chemical differences encountered in the analysis. We confirm the presence of two distinct populations, with consistently different dynamical and chemical properties. The low energy population seems to show higher overall abundances, whereas the high-energy one may be more metal-poor. We attribute this difference to the presence of at least two separate populations of stars within Gaia-Enceladus, likely associated with the innermost (low-energy) and outermost (high-energy) regions of the progenitor. The adopted models successfully reproduce the patterns in metallicity and [alpha/M] distributions in an inside-out scenario. Our analysis supports the presence of a former metallicity gradient in Gaia-Enceladus, and reinforces the interpretation of its accretion as a multi-passage event through the Milky Way disc.</description>

      <title>A JWST NIRCam/MIRI view of the W51A high-mass star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the W51A region, including the massive protoclusters W51-E and W51-IRS2, with JWST in 10 NIRCam and 5 MIRI filters. In this work, we highlight the most novel features apparent in these images and compare them with other multi-wavelength images. The broad view of the NIRCam/MIRI images of the W51A region shows that areas dominated by warm dust and ionized gas are distinct from those dominated by PAHs. The high angular resolution of the JWST images resolves dust filaments in high contrast, revealing geometrically converging features feeding W51-E and a cavity around W51-IRS2. This picture adds support to the hypothesis that feedback from W51-IRS2 is suppressing further gas infall onto the protocluster, while by contrast, gas is still accreting onto W51-E. Comparing the NIRCam and MIRI images to ALMA data, we find 24 sources detected by both JWST and ALMA, accounting for only $\sim10\%$ of the ALMA sources; the rest are too embedded or too cool to be detected by JWST. A knot of [Fe II] and H$_2$ emission north of W51-IRS2, previously detected in ground-based images, reveals peculiarly bright and compact peaks detected in all JWST bands. The knot is likely the most energetic example of a protostellar jet driven by a massive star impacting dense interstellar medium. The new images provide a complementary view to the previous long-wavelength perspective on this 4 x 8 pc area of one of the most active star-forming regions in our Galaxy, revealing new mysteries to be further explored.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of HI Envelopes Associated with Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of molecular clouds through the kinematics of their atomic hydrogen (HI) envelopes, using $^{12}\mathrm{CO}$ and 21-cm emission to trace the molecular and atomic gas, respectively. We measure the large-scale gradients, $\Omega$, in the velocity fields of 22 molecular clouds and their HI envelopes, then calculate their specific angular momenta, $j\propto \Omega R^2$. The molecular clouds have a median velocity gradient of $9.6\times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ pc^{-1}}$, and a typical specific angular momentum of $2.7 \times 10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$. The HI envelopes have smaller velocity gradients than their respective molecular clouds, with an average of $\Omega_\mathrm{HI} = 0.03\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ pc^{-1}}$, and a median angular momentum of $j_\mathrm{HI} \approx 5.7 \times 10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$. For a majority of the systems, $j_\mathrm{HI} &gt; j_\mathrm{H_2}$, with an average of $j_\mathrm{HI}/j_\mathrm{H_2} = 4$. Their velocity gradient directions tend to be misaligned, indicating that angular momentum is not conserved during molecular cloud formation. Both populations exhibit a $j-R$ scaling consistent with that expected of supersonic turbulence: $j_\mathrm{H_2} \propto R^{1.67\pm 0.22}$, and $j_\mathrm{HI} \propto R^{1.71\pm 0.27}$. Combining our measurements with previous observations, we demonstrate a scaling of $j \propto R^{1.50\pm 0.02}$ in star-forming regions spanning 5 dex in size, $R\in (10^{-3},\ 10^2) \ \mathrm{pc}$. We construct a model of angular momentum transport during molecular cloud formation, and derive the angular momenta of the progenitors to the present-day systems. We calculate a typical angular momentum redistribution timescale of 13 Myr, comparable to the HI envelope free-fall times.</description>

      <title>Investigating the origin of radio emission in candidate super-Eddington accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works show that the radio power of quasars accreting at very high rates can reach surprisingly high values. These studies suggest that this radio emission might originate from star formation, but lack of data leaves open the possibility that they could also contain a jetted active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate the origin of the radio emission of a sample of 18 super-Eddington candidates, over a wide range of redshifts. These sources are expected to have extreme radiative output per unit black hole mass, show high-velocity outflows and are therefore thought to be a prime mover of galactic evolution via radiative and mechanical feedback. We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations at L, C and X-band of these sources, which we combine with observations from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). We also use optical and IR data to derive estimates of accretion and wind parameters, as well as star formation rates to compare with the ones derived from the radio emission. Based on the radio variability, luminosity, morphology, radio spectral properties, radio vs IR estimates of star formation rate and radio-to-mid IR flux ratio, we find that 7 of our 18 targets are likely to have their radio emission predominantly coming from SF, and 6 from a combination of SF and AGN-related mechanisms, while only three sources indicate a core or jetted AGN only origin for the detected radio emission. This is consistent with previous studies, and supports the prevalence of lower power radio structures associated with star-forming activity rather than relativistic jets in the high Eddington ratio regime. In the same sample, however, we find three sources for which the data suggest a concomitant presence of super-Eddington accretion and relativistic ejections.</description>

      <title>Influence of star cluster mass, age, and galaxy star formation rate on star cluster radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters are key components of galaxies, and the relationship between cluster radius and mass encodes information about cluster formation and evolution. Theoretical models predict that age and specific star formation rate (sSFR) should influence cluster size through stellar mass loss and gas dynamics during formation. We hypothesized that if these theoretical predictions hold, multivariate models including age and sSFR should predict cluster radius better than models using mass alone. To test this, we used regression analysis on 5,105 star clusters from the LEGUS survey, comparing a full multivariate model against a mass-only baseline. We found that mass dominated the radius-mass relation: log(Mass) showed a strong correlation with radius (coefficient = 0.131 +/- 0.008, p &lt; 0.001), while log(sSFR) and log(Age) contributed negligibly (0.0002 +/- 0.015 and 0.038 +/- 0.006, respectively). Cross-validation revealed that the mass-only model generalized better (CV R^2 = 0.028 vs -0.017), with the negative value for the multivariate model indicating overfitting. Contrary to our hypothesis, adding age and sSFR did not improve predictive performance. The low R^2 (0.115) indicated that most variance in cluster radius remained unexplained by these variables, suggesting other factors may play important roles. Among the variables tested, our findings were consistent with virial equilibrium predictions, with mass serving as a more fundamental parameter than evolutionary age or galaxy star formation rate.</description>

      <title>Down-bending Breaks in Galactic Disks Are an Intrinsic Byproduct of Inside-out Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential profile has long been hypothesized as the fundamental morphology of galactic disks. The IllustrisTNG simulations reproduce diverse surface-density profiles: Type I (single exponential), Type II (down-bending), and Type III (up-bending), consistent with observed mass-size relations and kinematics. Type II disks dominate the stellar-mass regime $M_\star &lt; 10^{10.6} M_\odot$ with a prevalence of about 40%, exhibiting systematically extended morphologies. Conversely, Type III and Type I galaxies are more compact while following the same mass-size scaling relation. Evolutionary histories show that Type II galaxies experience minimal external perturbations, suggesting that Type II disks represent an intrinsic disk form and challenging conventional single-exponential paradigms. We demonstrate that Type II breaks arise naturally via inside-out growth since $z=1$, governed by synchronized cold-gas accretion and localized peaks in specific star formation rate. This mechanism also produces the characteristic U-shaped age profiles of Type II disks. Stellar dynamical redistribution plays a minor role in their formation.</description>

      <title>Unifying the dynamical classification of early-type galaxies: kinematic deficits in IllustrisTNG versus observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comparative analysis of galaxy kinematics using IllustrisTNG simulations and integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) observations. We identify 2,342 early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the TNG100 simulation and 236 ETGs from the TNG50 simulation, comparing them with observations from MaNGA and ATLAS$^{3D}$. For these systems, we measure key kinematic parameters: the intrinsic spin parameter $\lambda_{R,\mathrm{intr}}$ (measured edge-on), the cylindrical rotational energy fraction $\kappa_{\mathrm{rot}}$, and structural mass ratios including the spheroid mass fraction $f_{\mathrm{spheroid}}$ and stellar halo mass fraction $f_{\mathrm{halo}}$. Our study reveals that standard classifiers--the $\lambda_{R}(R_e)=0.31\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ relation and $\overline{k_5}$ coefficient (higher-order Fourier term of velocity fields)--fail to align with observed kinematic bimodality. We propose revised thresholds: $\lambda_{R,\mathrm{intr}} \sim 0.4$, $\kappa_{\mathrm{rot}} \sim 0.5$, and $f_{\mathrm{spheroid}} \sim 0.6$, which classify galaxies into rotation-dominated (fast rotators) and random motion-dominated (slow rotators). Scaling relations from TNG enable observational estimates of $\kappa_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{spheroid}}$. The simulations exhibit a bimodality deficit, characterized by a lack of fast rotators and suppressed $\lambda_{R,\mathrm{intr}}$, attributed to excess galaxies with intermediate rotation and high spheroid/stellar halo mass. We introduce a novel method to estimate $f_{\mathrm{halo}}$ from IFS kinematics, though uncertainties remain.</description>

      <title>ATOMS-QUARKS survey: Inflow and infall in massive protocluster G318.049+00.086: Evidence of competitive accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a gas kinematic study of the massive protocluster G318.049+00.086. The protocluster is reported to contain 12 prestellar core candidates and 4 protostellar cores. Filamentary structures are identified using the 1.3 mm dust continuum map, with four of them converge into a dense central region, forming a hub-filament system (HFS). High velocity gradients (10 - 20 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$) derived from PV analysis of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ emission along three of those filaments are suggestive of mass inflow onto the central hub. A mass inflow rate higher than $10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ along the filaments is indicating that the central hub is capable of forming massive star(s). Investigation of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and CCH spectral profiles revealed the majority of the cores having the characteristic blue asymmetric line profiles, typical signature of gravitational collapse. The remaining few cores showed red asymmetric profiles, indicative of gas expansion. Also, the derived mass infall rates for the protostellar cores in hub-region is significantly higher in comparison to those located along the filaments. The mass-radius relationship of the cores revealed that the cores with red profiles reside in the massive star formation regime. However, the global velocity gradient along the filaments suggests that these particular cores are losing material to the hub. Our results are supporting a competitive accretion scenario of massive star formation where gas is expected to be funnelled from less gravitationally dominant cores to the cores located at the gravitationally favorable position.</description>

      <title>Galactic disc warps from $z = 2.5$ to modern epoch: ruling out observational effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of galaxies show warps in their discs, usually noticeable at its periphery. The exact origin of this phenomenon is not fully established, although multiple warp formation mechanisms are proposed. In this study, we create a sample of more than 1000 distant ($z \lesssim 2.5$) edge-on galaxies imaged by HST and JWST. For these galaxies, we measurd characteristics of warps and finally analyse how their parameters and frequency change with time. We focus on our main result that galaxies with strong warps were more prevalent in the past compared to the modern epoch. We check how selection effects and varying image quality between objects in our sample could influence our results and conclude that varying fraction of warped galaxies is not caused by observational effects, but represents a genuine evolution. Such a trend may be consistent with mergers and interactions between galaxies being the primary mechanism of warp formation, as number density of galaxies decreases with time, implying higher rate of mergers and interactions in the past.</description>

      <title>Ion-Neutral Drift Velocity as a Diagnostic of Dust Growth and Magnetic Field in Star-Forming Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed that the ion-neutral drift velocity in star-forming molecular clouds and dense cores is on the order of 100 m s^-1. Theoretical studies have shown that, in ambipolar diffusion, the process responsible for the differential motion between ions and neutrals, the dust size distribution has a significant impact on the magnetic resistivities. In this study, we perform simulations to investigate how dust growth through accretion and coagulation affects the ion-neutral drift velocity in molecular clouds and cores. We find that, on core scales, both dust growth and a magnetic field strength of 200 microgauss are required to reproduce the observed drift velocity. We suggest that measurements of ion-neutral drift velocity, particularly on core scales, may serve as a new diagnostic to constrain the dust size distribution and magnetic field strength in such environments.</description>

      <title>What Drives the Bimodal Distribution of Eddington-Scaled Radio Luminosity in Nearby Early-Type Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {Early-type galaxies host low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, traced by radio emission spanning parsec- to kiloparsec scales.} {We investigate the Eddington-scaled radio luminosity distribution of 117 nearby early-type galaxies to test for bimodality and assess the role of host-galaxy properties, extending results from a 62-galaxy sample \cite{Wojtowicz2023}.} {We compile galaxies with directly measured black hole masses and 1.4,GHz and 3,GHz flux densities. Statistical tests assess bimodality, while VLASS imaging, host-galaxy kinematics, and central stellar structure characterize radio-dim and -bright sources.} {Using the 117-galaxy sample, we confirm that $L_{\rm 1.4,GHz}/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ is bimodal, with an antimode at $\approx -8.6$, which disappears when black hole masses are inferred from the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_\star$ relation. Radio-bright galaxies host resolved jets, while radio-dim systems show compact nuclear emission often exceeding that expected from star formation (FIR-radio correlation). Radio-bright galaxies are mainly slow rotators with depleted cores; radio-dim galaxies are predominantly fast rotators.} {Nearby early-type galaxies show a clear bimodality in Eddington-scaled radio luminosity, separating compact, radio-dim nuclei from extended, radio-bright systems. The dichotomy correlates with host-galaxy kinematics and central structure, indicating that sustained jet production depends primarily on galaxy assembly history and feeding mode rather than black hole mass or accretion rate alone. Radio-dim emission likely reflects intermittent, stochastic delivery of magnetized gas, plausibly via tidal disruption of giant-branch stars near the SMBH.}</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshift PDFs via Neural Network Classification for DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and Pan-STARRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neural network classification (NNC) method for photometric redshift estimation that produces well-calibrated redshift probability density functions (PDFs). The method discretizes the redshift space into ordered bins and optimizes the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which respects the ordinal nature of redshift and naturally provides uncertainty quantification. Unlike traditional regression approaches that output single point estimates, our method can capture multi-modal posterior distributions arising from color-redshift degeneracies. We apply this method to the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10 (LSDR10) and Pan-STARRS Data Release 2 (PS1DR2), using an unprecedented spectroscopic training sample from DESI DR1 and SDSS DR19. Our method achieves $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.0153$ and $\eta = 0.50\%$ on LSDR10, and $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.0222$ and $\eta = 0.34\%$ on PS1DR2 combined with unWISE infrared photometry. The NNC method outperforms Random Forest, XGBoost, and standard neural network regression. We demonstrate that DESI DR1 significantly improves photo-$z$ performance at $z &gt; 1$, while the combination of deep optical photometry and mid-infrared coverage is essential for achieving high precision across the full redshift range. We provide a unified photometric redshift catalog combining LSDR10 and PS1DR2 with a hierarchical model selection strategy based on available photometry. The well-calibrated PDFs produced by our method are valuable for cosmological studies and can be extended to next-generation surveys such as CSST, Euclid, and LSST.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass Growth in the First Galaxies: Theory and Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the growth in stellar mass of galaxies in the $6&lt;z&lt;12$ epoch with predictions of a semi-analytic galaxy formation model - Galacticus. In contrast to diverse and controversial results that compare models and data for the \emph{luminosity} evolution of galaxies -- reported in an abundance of recent papers, we find very good, unambiguous agreement in the more fundamental quantity of stellar mass - measured from JWST observations - and Galacticus predictions. Specifically, we find good agreement for the shape of the integrated stellar mass as a function of redshift without any adjustment of parameters, and in \emph{amplitude} as well, when 'feedback' is lowered by a factor of 3 compared to that required to match later-universe models and data. This result emerged from detailed investigation of the claim by Dressler et al. that bursts of star formation dominated the growth in stellar mass, specifically, that half of the galaxies with stellar mass growth of $M_* &gt; 2\times10^8 \mathrm{M}_\odot$ in the epoch $8&lt;z&lt;6$ had less than $M_*&lt;\times10^8 \mathrm{M}_\odot$ prior to $z = 8$. Here too we find agreement between models and data, namely that these ~100 Myr 'bursts' had strong in situ growth at $z\le8$, or showed (in Galacticus) substantial stellar and/or gas-rich mergers, and 30-40 Myr 'starbursts' as are common in $z&lt;3$ galaxies. We note that, if a theoretical simulation is unable to pass the test of matching the growth of stellar mass, any success in reproducing the luminosity function is meaningless.</description>

      <title>MAUVE: Cold neutral gas in the outflow of NGC 4383 and evidence for a fountain flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiphase study of the star-formation-driven outflow in the Virgo galaxy NGC 4383, combining ALMA CO(2-1) data with deep MeerKAT HI imaging and MUSE spectroscopy obtained as part of the Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) program. Our previous work revealed a spectacular ionised outflow, but the effect of the outflow on the cold phase remained unclear. Our analysis shows that potentially outflowing molecular gas is detected only within the inner 1 kpc above the disc, where CO clouds exhibit disturbed kinematics and spatial correspondence with the ionisation cone. At larger heights, the CO surface brightness rapidly drops, indicating that the molecular phase contributes little to the mass of outflowing gas. In contrast, the HI distribution shows plumes a few kiloparsecs above the disc that are aligned with the ionised cone, and complex kinematics suggestive of parts of the atomic phase being entrained in the outflow. However, the extended and warped HI disc associated with NGC 4383 complicates the unambiguous identification of outflowing atomic gas and, most importantly, the quantification of outflowing mass and loading factor. Independent support for a cold component in the outflow comes from dust extinction features associated with the outflow and coincident with HI plumes. Despite significant uncertainties in the estimate of the mass of cold gas associated with the outflow, these results suggest that the atomic phase likely dominates the cold outflow above 1 kpc. The observed cold gas velocities remain below the velocities of the ionised phase, suggesting that NGC 4383 does not host a large-scale escaping wind but more likely a galactic fountain, in which feedback redistributes material within the halo and regulates ongoing and future star formation.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Cloud Collisions Induce Filament-Mediated Super Star Cluster Formation in the Antennae Overlap Region: Evidence from ALMA and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of super star clusters (SSCs) in galaxies remains a fundamental yet unresolved problem. Among the proposed mechanisms, cloud-cloud collisions (CCCs) have been suggested as a potential trigger, although observational validation has been limited. Here we present high-resolution ($0.12^{\prime\prime}$, $\sim14\,\mathrm{pc}$) ALMA observations of CO ($J=1\!-\!0$) emission toward a super giant molecular cloud (SGMC) in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxies. The data resolve the SGMC into two distinct velocity components separated by $\sim50\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. One component exhibits a ``U-shaped'' structure within a large filament likely shaped by ram pressure, while the other shows hub-filament morphology. Such a morphology is naturally interpreted as a CCC scenario. The 108\,GHz continuum emission detected at the apparent collision interface is dominated by free-free radiation, with an ionizing photon rate consistent with the stellar mass and age of the optically identified SSCs. Supplementary infrared imaging with JWST reveals emission spatially coincident with the inferred collision interface, further supporting the CCC scenario. These results provide compelling, multi-wavelength evidence that CCCs play a key role in triggering SSC formation in merging galaxies.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Modeling Galactic Gravitational Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a physics-informed neural framework for modeling static and time-dependent galactic gravitational potentials. The method combines data-driven learning with embedded physical constraints to capture complex, small-scale features while preserving global physical consistency. We quantify predictive uncertainty through a Bayesian framework, and model time evolution using a neural ODE approach. Applied to mock systems of varying complexity, the model achieves reconstruction errors at the sub-percent level ($0.14\%$ mean acceleration error) and improves dynamical consistency compared to analytic baselines. This method complements existing analytic methods, enabling physics-informed baseline potentials to be combined with neural residual fields to achieve both interpretable and accurate potential models.</description>

      <title>Two faces of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus: Mining the chemical abundance space with graph attention networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that chemical abundances hold the key to disentangling halo substructure, providing a more reliable tracer than dynamics alone. We aim to probe the Milky Way stellar halo using high-dimensional chemical abundances from GALAH DR4. By leveraging multiple nucleosynthesis channels in synergy with integrals of motion (IoM), we extract information hidden in the raw abundance space to perform chemical tagging. With a graph attention autoencoder, we reconstruct a dynamics-informed, denoised chemical space and identify coherent stellar substructures by applying ensemble clustering. Our method successfully recovers the three largest globular clusters hidden in the dataset, estimates the in-situ fraction to be approximately 41\%, and chemically characterizes several dynamical halo substructures. Strikingly, stars dynamically associated with Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) separate into two chemically distinct clusters. By examining their abundances, energy ($E$) and angular momentum ($L_z$) distributions, together with the metallicity trend with $E$, we connect these clusters to their birthplace within the progenitor by proposing a simple infall scenario: one cluster traces the metal-poor, less evolved outskirts, while the other traces the metal-rich, chemically evolved core.</description>

      <title>PRISMS. U37126, a very blue, ISM-naked starburst at z=10.255 with nearly 100% Lyman continuum escape fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present very deep (~11h) JWST/MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical emission of U37126, a UV-bright (M_UV ~ -20), mildly lensed ($\mu\simeq 2.2$) galaxy at z=10.255. The continuum emission is well detected in both NIRSpec and MIRI spectra, yet no nebular recombination or metal emission lines are observed (EW(Hbeta+[OIII])&lt;300A and EW(Halpha)&lt;400A, at 3sigma). Combined with the exceptionally blue UV continuum slope, beta_UV ~ -2.9, and weak/flat Balmer break, these constraints indicate a stellar population dominated by very young and massive stars with a strongly suppressed nebular contribution. Comparisons with synthetic stellar population models indicate that U37126 requires both a very high ionizing photon production efficiency, log(Xi_ion / Hz erg^-1) ~ 25.75, and a nearly unit LyC escape fraction, of fesc&gt;86% (3sigma) based on Halpha flux limit and fesc=0.94+/-0.06 derived independently from SED fitting. The best-fit SED yields a (de-lensed) stellar mass of Mstar ~ 10^7.8 Msun and a star-formation rate of SFR~10Msun/yr (sSFR~160 Gyr^-1), that along with its very compact size, reff~61pc, yields very high stellar mass and star-formation-rate surface densities, Sigma_M ~ 3x10^3 Msun/pc^2 and Sigma_SFR ~ 400 Msun/yr/kpc^2. Together with the lack of detectable nebular emission, these properties suggest that U37126 is undergoing an ``ISM-naked'' starburst phase, possibly driven by an extremely efficient gas-to-star conversion followed by strong feedback that has cleared the remaining gas from its stellar core, allowing most LyC photons to escape. Finally, we show that even a small fraction of galaxies like U37126 (~ 3%-6%), with extreme LyC production and escape, could contribute disproportionately (~ 50%-100%) to the ionizing photon budget during cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>PRISMS. UNCOVER-26185, a metal-poor SFG at z=10.05 with no evidence for a X-ray-luminous AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the first results of the PRImordial galaxy Survey with MIRI Spectroscopy (PRISMS), a JWST cycle 4 program (PID 8051) aimed at the characterization of a relatively large sample of ten galaxies about 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Here, we present deep (13.9 hours) spectroscopy with the MIRI LRS of the lensed galaxy UNCOVER-26185 at a redshift of z=10.054. It is a faint UV galaxy (UV absolut magnitude of -18.83 mag) previously identified as a X-ray luminous AGN. MIRI LRS detects the H$\beta$+[OIII]4960,5008 complex and H$\alpha$ emission line with a significance of 10$\sigma$ and 8$\sigma$, respectively, as well as the optical continuum emission at rest-frame 0.45 $\mu$m and 0.57 $\mu$m with a signal-to-noise ratio of 6-7. The UV-to-optical spectral energy distribution, combining continuum and emission lines, is compatible with: (i) a low stellar (A$_V$= 0.2) and nebular (A$_V$=0.0) extinction, (ii) a SFH composed by a young (7 Myr) starburst and an intermediate-age (65 Myr) stellar population, and (iii) a total stellar mass of 1.7$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. The H$\alpha$-derived star-formation rate is 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The low optical emission line ratios locate UNCOVER-26185 as the most metal-poor (Z = 0.04 Z$_{\odot}$), and as outlier with the lowest ionization (logU=-2.5) galaxy identified so far at redshifts above 9. With no evidence of an active galactic nuclei in the rest-frame UV-to-optical spectrum, UNCOVER-26185 has the properties of a metal-poor, main-sequence star-forming galaxy at redshift 10, with ISM and ionization properties very different than those of the already studied UV-bright galaxies at redshifts beyond 10. PRISMS is starting to explore the population of intermediate-UV luminosity galaxies at z=10, covering UV absolute magnitudes in the range of -17.9 to -20.5, fainter than those of UV-bright galaxies studied so far.</description>

      <title>DeepDive: Tracing the early quenching pathways of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$ from their star-formation histories and chemical abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chemical abundances and star-formation histories (SFH) of ten massive ($\mathrm{log}_{10} (M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})&gt;10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ using deep, medium-resolution spectroscopic data obtained as part of the \textit{JWST DeepDive} Cycle 2 GO program. Our \textit{DeepDive} sample demonstrates early formation and quenching times inferred from spectro-photometric fitting, with most galaxies having formed 50\% of their stellar mass by $z \sim 5$, and quenching by $z \sim 4$, showing good agreement across the various SFH parameterizations explored in this work. Though they differ slightly between SFH parameterizations, the inferred formation timescales for the {\it DeepDive} sample span both rapid ($\lesssim$ 100 Myr) and more extended ($\gtrsim$ 200 Myr) episodes, corresponding to star formation occurring over a few to several dynamical times given their compact sizes and high densities at $z\sim3-4$. On average, massive quiescent galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ are $\alpha$-enhanced ($\langle [\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\rangle$= $0.22^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$), although there is strong diversity ($\sim0.3$ dex in scatter) among individual [$\alpha$/Fe] values. Our results for $\alpha$-enhancement are consistent with lower-redshift studies, implying weak evolution in [$\alpha$/Fe] from $z \sim 4$ to $z\sim 1$. The SFH timescales associated with the low [$\alpha$/Fe] measurements suggest longer formation timescales, potentially pointing to earlier enrichment by Type Ia supernovae, or metals preferentially being removed via outflows driven either by powerful early active galactic nuclei or supernovae. Overall, this work represents the first, statistically representative combined study of the star-formation histories and chemical abundances of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Nested Fermi and eROSITA bubbles require very similar $\sim10^{55}$ erg collimated Galactic-center outbursts; their asymmetry indicates an eastern density gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations indicate two nested pairs of extended bipolar bubbles emanating from the Milky-Way center - the $|b|\sim80^\circ$ latitude eROSITA bubbles (RBs), encompassing the smaller, $|b|\sim 50^{\circ}$ Fermi bubbles (FBs) - and classify the edges of both bubble pairs as strong forward shocks. Identifying each bubble pair as driven by a distinct, collimated outburst, we evolve these bubbles and constrain their origin using a stratified 1D model verified by a suite of 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations which reproduce X-ray observations. While the RBs are at the onset of slowdown, the FBs are still expanding ballistically into the RB-shocked medium. Observational constraints indicate that both RB and FB outbursts had (up to factor $\sim2$-$3$ uncertainties) $\sim4^\circ$ half-opening angles and $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$ velocities $100$ pc from their base, carrying $\sim10^{55}$ erg. The FBs and RBs could thus arise from identical outbursts separated by $\sim10$ Myr; their longitudinal asymmetry favors an eastern ambient-density gradient over western wind suggestions.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Characterizing Companions with a Calibrated Gaia DR2, DR3, and Hipparcos Catalog (G23H)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia DR4 epoch astrometry will enable the detection of thousands of exoplanets through astrometric motion. Here, we present a composite catalog and modeling framework that extracts the maximum information from existing Hipparcos and Gaia data releases. We calibrate Gaia DR2 proper motions and DR3-DR2 scaled position differences against the Gaia DR3 reference frame, and combine these with the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations, the Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data, Gaia astrometric excess noise, and Gaia radial velocity variability constraints. We implement a joint likelihood model for these data in Octofitter that marginalizes over Gaia's unpublished observation epochs. This results in full orbit posteriors that can be computed uniformly for a large class of companions. We compare these posteriors to published orbital solutions for 25 stellar binaries from the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars, recovering all companions at high significance and broadly consistent orbital separations. We then recover independent evidence to support 94 of 120 tested Jovian exoplanetary systems from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (plus 3 known stellar companions, and one previously detected planet we now rule out). We demonstrate that in cases like 14 Her b, the posteriors confirm the planetary nature of a signal using only Gaia and Hipparcos data. We find no false positives among 25 RV-quiet standard stars without significant Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations. Our method can break degeneracies inherent to proper motion anomaly or excess noise modeling alone by resolving orbital curvature within the Gaia baseline. The catalog and updated Octofitter are made publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Carbon measurements in two ultra-faint dwarf galaxies: Grus II and Tucana IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are some of the oldest and most metal-poor environments in the Local Group. In particular, they are predicted to host the first stars (only H and He) that lit up in our Universe. No metal-free stars have been found to date, but their chemical products can be observed on the surfaces of the ancient second-generation stars such as the carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars (CEMP-no, [C/Fe]&gt;+0.7).} However, in each UFD there are only a few stars bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up, therefore it is crucial to study as many of these systems as possible. Here we follow up stars belonging to two recently discovered UFDs, Grus II and Tucana IV. The spectra analyzed were obtained with the multi-object spectrograph FLAMES/Giraffe at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). This includes spectra in two wavelength ranges: red spectra around the CaII triplet (8498 {\AA}, 8542 {\AA}, 8662 {\AA}) used to derive radial velocity and [Fe/H], and blue spectra covering the CH band at ~ 4300 {\AA}. In total, we analyzed 21 spectra of member candidates for Grus II and 17 for Tucana IV, including both Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Horizontal Branch (HB) stars. We identified 13 members in Grus II (thereof 8 RGB stars) and 7 members in Tucana IV (thereof 3 RGB stars). Among the RGB stars in Grus II, we found three CEMP-no stars at [Fe/H]~-3 and [C/Fe]&gt;+1 and two CEMP-no stars at slightly higher [Fe/H] and [C/Fe]&gt;+0.7. In Tucana IV, we found one CEMP-no star ([Fe/H]=-2.75 and [C/Fe] = +0.83). This project, along with future investigations of CEMP stars in UFDs, allows us to study the impact of the first stars in these ancient and primitive systems and consequently the first chemical enrichment that occurred in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Radial and Rotational Velocities of a Volume-Complete Sample of M Dwarfs with Masses 0.1-0.3 Msun within 15 parsecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results from a five-year campaign to gather multi-epoch, high-resolution spectra of a volume-complete sample of 413 M dwarfs with masses 10-30% that of the Sun that lie within 15 parsecs. We report weighted mean systemic radial velocities (RV) and rotational broadening measurements ($v \sin i$) for our targets. Our typical relative RV uncertainties are less than $50$ m/s for the isolated, slowly rotating targets in our sample, and increase but remain less than 1 km/s for more rapidly rotating stars. The majority of the single stars in our sample ($71\pm3$%) have rotational broadening below our detection limit of 3.4 km/s. When combined with astrometric data, our radial velocities allow us to calculate galactic space motions, which we use to assign thin or thick disk membership. We determine that 81% and 8% of our sample are highly probable thin and highly probable thick disk members, respectively. We report seven new multi-lined multiple systems and identify six additional targets with velocity variations indicative of long-period binaries, of which three are new detections. Finally, we find no significant difference in the stellar multiplicity rates of the thin disk ($22\pm2$%) and thick disk ($21\pm8$%) populations in our sample, implying that mid-M dwarfs are not significantly losing their companions at these relative ages. Our survey more than triples the number of these fully-convective stars with complete astrometric data and uniformly derived, multi-epoch, high-resolution RVs and rotational broadening measurements.</description>

      <title>Method on Using Shadow Altitude to Remove Geocoronal H$\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic surveys allow spatially resolved spectroscopy of galaxies to study their interstellar medium (ISM). However, observations of Galactic H$\alpha$ emission are contaminated by geocoronal H$\alpha$ emission. The latter is known to depend on the shadow altitude, a geometric parameter relating the line of sight to Earth's shadow cone. Using fibres on blank skys from the SDSS-IV/MaStar survey, we established an empirical relation between the geocoronal H$\alpha$ emission and the shadow altitude, with a root mean square fractional scatter of 23.52$\%$. This relation can be used to predict geocoronal H$\alpha$ emission so that it can be removed from observed spectra. This removal method is advantageous when the observed targets are extensive in the sky, and it does not require a large velocity separation between the observed target and the local standard of rest. This will enable reliable studies of Galactic H$\alpha$ in intermediate spectral resolution integral field spectroscopic surveys. We also find tentative evidences for the dependences of geocoronal emission on solar activity and the distance between the Earth and the Sun.</description>

      <title>Wigner Function Shapelets I : formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend shapelets for the analysis of galaxy images to be available in a phase space, introducing \textit{Wigner Function Shapelets (WFS)}. Whereas conventional shapelets expand images separately in configuration or Fourier space using Hermite-Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian modes, WFS represents images directly in the four-dimensional phase space with symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$, which is quantised by a phase-space cell $2\pi\lambdabar$ that determines a resolution limit of a telescope. WFS consists of a bilinear form of the cross-Wigner function of the Laguerre-Gaussian modes as an orthogonal and complete basis for the Wigner function of an image, carrying out $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ irreducible representations of the phase space with the Hopf tori. We introduce a scalar function $\mathcal{W}_{k\ell} (Q_0,Q_2)$ from the $\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$ - covariant tori to a two-dimensional space of constants of motion $(Q_0,Q_2)$ -- the harmonic energy and axial angular momentum -- thereby yielding a natural phase-space ``band structure'', given a pair of winding number $(k,\ell) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$. %
WFS leverage key properties of the Wigner function for image analysis: (i) it encodes full information of an image in a symmetry-preserving way; (ii) its trasport equation naturally involves with a Liouville equation at $\lambdabar \rightarrow 0$; (iii) it admits positive/negative oscillatory patterns on $(Q_0,Q_2)$ plane that can be sensitive spatial coherent structure of galaxy morphology and cosmological imprints; and (iv) systematics and noise can be manipulated as a quantum channel operation. This paper aims to bring all the formulae related to the Wigner function in the context of astrophysics and cosmology, formally organising in both terminologies of astronomy and of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>A Serendipitous NuSTAR Detection of a Giant Radio Source Harboring an Obscured Active Galactic Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant radio sources (GRSs) harbor the Universe's largest structures generated by individual galaxies, with projected source sizes exceeding 700 kpc. These enigmatic objects have been mainly studied at radio frequencies, and their physical properties in the high-energy domain are poorly understood. Here we present the results of a multiwavelength study focused on NuSTAR J112829+5831.8 (J1128+5831), the only known GRS serendipitously detected with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array. Being located in proximity to the famous interacting galaxy system, Arp 299, J1128+5831 has been serendipitously observed also by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, and XMM-Newton satellites. From radio observations with the Low Frequency Array, the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Very Large Array Sky Survey, we have determined that J1128+5831 has an overall steep radio spectrum ($\alpha=-0.86$; $F_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha$) and a low core dominance ($C_{\rm D}=-2.4$, in log-scale), indicating the source to be viewed at large angles. From the X-ray spectral analysis, we found J1128+5831 to harbor an obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) with neutral hydrogen column density exceeding $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Its optical spectrum, taken with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, exhibits prominent narrow emission lines but lacks broad components, thus confirming J1128+5831 to be a Type 2 AGN powered by a radiatively efficient accreting system. Overall, the broadband properties of J1128+5831 are consistent with those observed for the general GRS population.</description>

      <title>Two late-T dwarfs at kiloparsec distances revealed by JWST UNCOVER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a search for brown dwarf candidates in a James Webb Space Telescope deep field around A2744 to investigate the space density of these objects at kiloparsec distances. Our methodology employed an initial selection based on photometric colours, followed by spectral energy distribution fitting to both stellar atmospheric models and high-redshift galaxy templates. This approach yielded two robust T dwarf candidates and one possible L subdwarf candidate. The T dwarfs have estimated Galactic heights of 0.43 and 0.86 kpc, likely residing near the outer edges of the Galactic thin and thick discs, respectively. We measure a T dwarf surface number density of 0.094 per squared arcmin in the UNCOVER field, lower than previous predictions but consistent at the order-of-magnitude level. We also provide space number density estimates for T5-T8.9 dwarfs across different effective temperature and spectral type bins, finding that T5-T7 dwarfs out to 2 kpc have significantly lower densities than their solar neighbourhood counterparts, whilst T8 dwarfs within the thick disc exhibit densities comparable to local values. Our analysis demonstrates that broad-band near- to mid-infrared photometry provides high sensitivity to late-T dwarfs but is relatively less sensitive to L and early-T dwarfs. Spectroscopy is typically required to distinguish photometric candidates of L dwarfs, early-T subdwarfs, and high-redshift galaxies in JWST deep fields. This study demonstrates the potential for expanding our understanding of brown dwarf distributions and characteristics at unprecedented distances, offering new insights into substellar populations beyond the solar neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>Gravitational trapping and ram pressure trapping of ultracompact and hypercompact H II regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observationally, early H II regions are classified by size into ultracompact and hypercompact configurations. It remains unclear whether these phases are long-lived or transient. Understanding the physical processes that stall H II region growth may help to solve the so-called lifetime problem: the observation of more compact H II regions than expected from theory. Utilizing two-dimensional, axially symmetric radiation hydrodynamic simulations of young expanding H II regions, including the phase of early star and disk formation, we seek to better understand the trapping of H II regions. Trapping forces include gravity and ram pressure, which oppose forces such as thermal pressure expansion, radiation pressure, and centrifugal force. Without radiation pressure, the H II region remains gravitationally trapped in the ultracompact phase indefinitely. With radiation pressure, the H II region escapes gravitational trapping but experiences ram pressure trapping on larger scales. For initial mass reservoirs with high central density, no trapping occurs, while a less steep density gradient yields clear trapped phases. Hypercompact trapped phases exhibit a so-called flickering variation in H II region radius, in agreement with observations of stalling and even contraction over small time scales. With radiation pressure, low-density reservoirs experience both gravitational and ram pressure trapping, while high-mass reservoirs undergo only the latter.</description>

      <title>Clustering of emission line galaxies with IllustrisTNG -- II. cosmology challenge with anisotropic correlation functions and ELG-halo connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are the primary tracers of the large-scale structures of the Universe in ongoing Stage-IV cosmological spectroscopic surveys, which aim to measure the clustering statistics at higher redshifts $z \simeq 1.5 \text{--} 2$ with unprecedented precision. In this study, we construct realistic mock ELG samples with IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations and stellar population synthesis framework. In order to validate the modelling of clustering, we measure the anisotropic correlation functions of mock ELGs and infer the linear growth rate, which is one of key cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering. As a control sample, we construct the mass-limited subhalo samples with the same number density as ELGs. The isotropic correlation functions in real space for both samples do not differ significantly. However, the quadrupole moment of the anisotropic correlation function, which is sensitive to the velocity of galaxies, is suppressed for ELGs, potentially due to the infalling motion of ELGs towards the centre of the hosting halos. The smaller amplitude leads to the underestimation of the linear growth rate and implies the velocity bias between ELGs and dark matter. When the analysis is limited to large scales $(\gtrsim 15 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc})$, the parameter bias vanishes. Next, we investigate the ELG-halo connection through the phase-space distribution of satellite ELGs within hosting halos and galactic conformity of star formation activity. The infalling motion is further confirmed by the phase-space distribution relative to the host halo, and this dynamics of ELGs challenges the assumption that the radial distribution of satellites follows that of dark matter.</description>

      <title>X-ray counterparts to stellar MeerKAT Galactic-plane compact radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio emission from magnetically active stars arises mainly from non-thermal processes and complements high-energy X-ray emission. Sensitive, wide-field radio and X-ray surveys now allow identification of larger samples of active stars across the Galaxy. We aim to identify and characterise radio and X-ray-emitting stars in the Galactic plane by combining MeerKAT radio data with soft X-ray observations and assess their consistency with the canonical G\"udel-Benz relation, which links thermal coronal X-rays to non-thermal gyrosynchrotron radio emission. We cross-matched compact sources from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey with counterparts from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and the first release of SRG/eROSITA (eRASS1). We computed radio-brightness temperatures and radio-X-ray luminosities to test the relation. We identify 137 stars with both radio and X-ray detections. Their $T_B$ ranges from $10^7$ to $10^{12}$ K, except two outliers: AXJ1600.9-5142 ($4.8 \pm 1.5 \times 10^{12}$ K) and HD~124831 ($8 \pm 1 \times 10^{6}$ K). The remainder are consistent with incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission. The sample lies below the canonical G\"udel-Benz relation, driven by enhanced 1.3 GHz radio luminosities relative to the 5 GHz relation. This suggests the classical relation represents an upper envelope rather than a tight correlation. Additionally, eROSITA detections show early-type stars lie below the typical $\log (L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}) \sim -3$ relation.</description>

      <title>Noble gases Neon and argon: a role for the chemical patterns of multiple populations in globular clusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the sodium destruction in models reaching the high hot bottom burning temperatures needed to efficiently cycle oxygen to nitrogen in AGB models at the nominal [Fe/H] of the cluster NGC 2808. We increase the initial neon abundance by a factor 2-4 with respect to the "standard" abundances obtained by scaling the solar values down to the metallicity of this cluster, and explore the average abundances in the ejecta obtained by adopting smaller mass-loss rates. Higher neon produces higher sodium in the AGB envelope. Lowering the mass-loss rate allows both to keep reasonably large sodium abundances and to increase the depletion of oxygen and magnesium. A balance between the lower mass-loss rates and the necessity of not increasing too much the episodes of third dredge up gives a neon abundance larger by a factor two and a mass-loss rate smaller by a factor four as best compromise. Comparison with the abundances in NGC 2808 shows a better agreement than the standard models for all the patterns of abundances, but the extreme stars (group E) requires models slightly less rich in iron. t Thus, we propose that the extreme population in NGC 2808 is composed of stars having a slightly smaller metallicity, and sketch a possible scenario for its formation, in the framework of the hierarchical clusters assembly scenario. Abundances of potassium are larger by $\sim 0.2 dex$ in the E group, but the explanation in terms of burning of the initial argon requires a drastic increase of the relevant cross section. The abundances of neon and argon at low metallicities may be an important tool to better reproduce the abundances of light elements in the framework of the AGB model for globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Massive stellar cannibals: How stellar mergers drive mass-loss in extremely massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been theorized that the formation of extremely massive and supermassive stars ($&gt;10^3\ {\rm M}_\odot$) could plausibly be the outcome of stellar mergers in low metallicity ($Z&lt;10^{-1}$~Z$_\odot$) and dense ($\gtrsim10^3\ {\rm M}_\odot\ {\rm pc}^{-3}$) stellar environments. These objects remain relevant as they can serve as the progenitors of intermediate-mass black holes and they are also formidable chemical polluter candidates, as evidenced by the peculiar abundances seen across cosmic history. This work investigates merger-induced mass loss in extremely massive stars within a hydrodynamic framework and provides a prescription derived from the simulations to estimate both the mass loss and the outcome of the interaction. We adapted the 1D hydrodynamic, stellar structure, and evolution code MESA to simulate stellar inspirals. In our simulations, we considered stars of $&gt;1000\,\rm M_{\odot}$ with inspiraling companions of $&lt;100$ M$_\odot$; hence, with mass ratios of $&lt;0.1$. As the inspiral progresses, the orbital energy of the system is lost through the hydrodynamic and gravitational drag forces. This energy gets deposited as thermal energy in the extremely massive star's envelope. We find that the total ejected mass is $\sim$10-30$\%$ of the system's mass. Our results point out that most of the energy deposited by the inspiral is used to eject mass. These findings demonstrate that merger-induced mass loss is non-negligible for the considered configurations. Thus, it is an important process to account for when investigating the formation of extremely massive stars and predicting their possible role throughout cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Contribution of Active Galactic Nuclei to the Diffuse High-Energy Neutrino Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy neutrinos from NGC 1068 and TXS-0506+56 suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) may contribute significantly to the the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube. Using 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, we performed a systematic population analysis of X-ray-bright and gamma-ray-bright AGN to evaluate the extent to which this diffuse flux could originate from these sources. We find that gamma-ray-bright blazars can account for no more than 16\% of IceCube's total diffuse flux. Although we find no evidence of neutrino emission from gamma-ray-bright, non-blazar AGN, we cannot exclude the possibility that these sources contribute significantly to the diffuse flux. In contrast, we report (pre-trials) evidence of neutrino emission from several nearby, X-ray-bright, Seyfert-type AGN, including \mbox{NGC 1068} ($4.9\sigma$), SWIFT J1041.4-1740 ($2.6\sigma$), SWIFT J0202.4+6824A/B ($2.6\sigma$), SWIFT J0744.0+2914 (2.6$\sigma$), NGC 4151 ($2.5\sigma$), and NGC 3079 ($2.5\sigma$). Although not fully conclusive, these results suggest that IceCube may be detecting neutrinos from a larger population of Seyfert galaxies. The fact that these sources are not gamma-ray bright indicates that their neutrino production must be taking place in optically thick environments, such as in the coronae surrounding these galaxies' supermassive black holes. We also identify a $4.2\sigma$ correlation between the neutrinos detected by IceCube and members of the Swift-BAT catalog of X-ray-bright AGN, although this correlation is dominated by NGC 1068. We estimate that this class of sources contributes between 11.2\% and the entirety of IceCube's total diffuse neutrino flux. These results strengthen the emerging case for the prevalence of gamma-ray-obscured AGN as significant sources of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: Context. Distances to evolved massive stars in the Milky Way are not well constrained by Gaia parallaxes due to their brightness and variability. This makes it difficult to determine their fundamental stellar parameters, such as radius or luminosity, and infer their evolutionary states. Aims. We aim to improve the distance estimates of Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs) and Yellow Supergiants (YSGs) by identifying possible cluster and association memberships. Using these distances, we derived updated luminosities and revised their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Methods. We compiled from the literature a sample of 35 luminous yellow massive stars (YHGs and the most luminous YSGs). We used Gaia DR3 astrometry to identify possible membership in clusters and OB associations. We derived distances by combining the parallaxes of nearby co-moving stars. We independently validated these distances by comparing the stellar radial velocities to the Galactic H I kinematic map. We combined angular diameters and effective temperature values from the literature with the new distances to estimate luminosities. Results. We improved the distance estimates for 28 of the 35 stars through association with co-moving stellar groups. For an additional six stars, we provided distance estimates based on the H I kinematic map. For one star, the distance remains unclear. Most YSGs are members of young stellar populations, while the environments of the YHGs are more diverse, and for some of them, their origin populations remain unclear. We derived updated luminosities for a subset of 20 stars. Most YHGs have luminosities above log L/L = 5.4, while YSGs occupy a wider range of luminosities and the most luminous YSGs have luminosities similar to YHGs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>

Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ ($0.143_{-0.041}^{+0.068}$) for 8 (6) binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$ ($&lt;10^{-9.5}$) m\,s$^{-2}$ representing $&gt; 3.5\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton. However, one system (Stars HD189739 and HD189760) dominates the signal. Without it, the tension with Newton is significantly lessened with $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.041}^{+0.065}$. Thus, to verify the tentative signal, many such systems need to be discovered and their kinematic nature such as any possibility of hidden tertiary stars needs to be thoroughly addressed. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>MUSE Study of Two Giant Low-surface-brightness Galaxies with Compact Satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant low-surface-brightness disk galaxies (gLSBGs) are rare objects with disk radii up-to 160 kpc and dynamical masses of an order of up to 10$^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$. Their very existence challenges currently accepted theories of galaxy formation and evolution, as it is difficult to build such large, dynamically cold disks through mergers without destroying them. We present deep MUSE mosaic observations of two nearby gLSBGs with compact elliptical satellites: UGC 1382, which hosts a globally counter-rotating gaseous disk, and AGC 192040, which does not. We analyze properties of ionized gas and present spatially resolved kinematics and metallicity maps; as well as stellar population analysis for the central regions of the galaxies. The radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities are flat for both galaxies. Our estimates of the effective oxygen yield suggest 'passive' gas in the outskirts of both stellar systems that is not involved in star formation. Our observational data indicate that both galaxies experienced mergers several Gyrs ago. However, the scenarios of formation of giant disks appear to be slightly different for these two systems. For AGC 192040 we propose the gas accretion from the filament followed by the intermediate-mass ratio merger with the companion on a prograde orbit. For UGC 1382 multiple gas-rich mergers with companions on retrograde orbits are preferred by the data.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei Using Hydrodynamic Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional environments in the Universe. A nuclear star cluster like that of the Milky Way harbors a supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds ($\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside. Direct collisions occur in such high-density environments, where they can shape the stellar populations and influence the evolution of the cluster. We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\odot$ stars, at impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of ``hit-and-run'' collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters, while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for periapses $\gtrsim 0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks, for predicting collision outcomes. We find that the neural network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter space of initial conditions expands.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VIII: Spectroscopic detection of rare earth dysprosium, erbium, lutetium and thorium in Classical Cepheids</title>

Abstract: Classical Cepheids are among the most important distance calibrators thanks to the correlation between their period and luminosity, and play a crucial role in the calibration as the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder. Given their typical age, they also constitute an optimal tracer of the young population in the Galactic disc. We performed a complete spectroscopic analysis of 136 spectra obtained from three different high-resolution spectrographs, for a total of 60 DCEPs. More than half have pulsational periods longer than 15 days, up to 70 days, doubling the number of stars in our sample with P&gt;15d. We derived radial velocities, atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for up to 33 different species. We present an updated list of trusted spectroscopic lines for the detection and estimation of chemical abundances. We used this new set to revisit the abundances already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey and increase the number of available chemical species. For the first time (to our knowledge), we present the estimation of abundances for Cepheids for dysprosium, as well as a systematic estimation of erbium, lutetium, and thorium abundances. We calculated a galactic radial gradient for [Fe/H] with a slope of -0.064 pm 0.002 dex kpc-1, in good agreement with recent literature estimation. The other elements also exhibit a clear negative radial trend, with this effect diminishing and eventually disappearing for heavier neutron-capture elements. Depending on the proposed spiral arms model present in several literature sources, our most external stars agree on tracing either the Perseus, the Norma-Outer, or both the Outer and the association Outer-Scutum-Centaurus arms.</description>

      <title>Deuterium fractionation and CO depletion in Barnard 5</title>

Abstract: Deuterium fractionation provides a key diagnostic of the physical and chemical evolution of prestellar and protostellar cores, where it is strongly linked to CO depletion in cold, dense gas. We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\rm HCO^+}=0.09\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\pm0.03$ and $0.05\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\pm0.1$ to $5.0\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Non-universal Extinction Curve on the Wesenheit Function and Cepheid Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wesenheit function is widely used to reduce the effects of interstellar reddening in distance measurements. Its construction, however, relies on the assumption of a universal extinction curve and on fixed values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. Recent studies have shown that Rv varies significantly across the Milky Way and between different galaxies, raising concerns about systematic biases in Wesenheit magnitudes and period-Wesenheit relations. In this work, we discuss the impact of non-universal extinction on Wesenheit indices by combining the Rv-dependent extinction curve with a grid of stellar atmosphere models. We compute the integrated extinction in optical and near-infrared passbands, derive Rv-dependent R coefficients for multiple Wesenheit indices, and examine how changes in Rv propagate into Wesenheit magnitudes and Cepheid distances in our Galaxy. We find that the R coefficients in the Wesenheit functions vary strongly with Rv. For classical Cepheids in the Milky Way disk, variations of Rv within the typical observed range (2.6-3.6) can lead to substantial differences in the Wesenheit function, reaching +-0.7 mag from the mean for the Gaia-based Wesenheit index W_G and resulting in distance errors of almost 40%. Near-infrared Wesenheit indices are much less sensitive to Rv changes. Our results clearly show that accounting for variable Rv is essential when applying period-Wesenheit relations, particularly in the optical regime, or that near or mid infrared based distances should be used. While we present this effect for classical Cepheids, it applies to all pulsating stars for which period-Wesenheit relations are used to infer distances.</description>

      <title>Orbital classification in rotating bar potentials using an empirical proxy of the second integral of motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for classifying two-dimensional orbits in rotating bar potentials, based on an empirical proxy for the second integral of motion, Calibrated Angular Momentum (CAM), which is defined as the ratio of the time-averaged angular momentum ($\overline{L_z}$) to its temporal dispersion ($\sigma_{L_z}$) in the corotating frame. We show that CAM is determined by the ratio of the azimuthal to radial actions (${J_\phi}^\prime / {J_r}^\prime$) in the analytical Freeman bar model. We then construct a new parameter space defined by CAM versus the root-mean-square radius ($R_{RMS}$), and apply this framework to orbits in several representative rotating bar potentials. In the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane, periodic orbits generate well-defined branches separating distinct regions corresponding to different orbital families. Several of these branches enclose isolated areas that can be associated with specific orbital families, such as the the $x_2$ orbital family. We further validate the method using orbits from test-particle simulations, which show a well-ordered and non-overlapping distribution of orbital families in the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane. Since CAM is fundamentally linked to intrinsic orbital properties and readily applied to three-dimensional orbits in N-body simulations, our results establish the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane as a robust and efficient framework for orbit classification in rotating bars that complements conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: Braids are periodic solutions to the general N-body problem in gravitational dynamics. These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of ~9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo. If composed of compact objects, they potentially form interesting targets for gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Drivers of Disk Warps in Tilted and Tumbling TNG50 Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) halos in $\Lambda$ Cold DM cosmological simulations are triaxial. Most exhibit figure rotation. We study 40 isolated halos with stellar disks from the TNG50 simulation suite across $\sim 4$~Gyr to understand whether and how a triaxial halo's tumbling and orientation relative to the disk can drive warps. We measure a warp angle $\psi$ and find even our isolated disks are all at least slightly warped, with each galaxy's maximum $\psi &gt; 1.8^{\circ}$. We perform a modified cross-correlation analysis between $\psi$ and the figure rotation pattern speed, as well as the misalignment between the disk spin axis and (a) the figure rotation axis, (b) the halo minor axis, and (c) the gas angular momentum axis. We use snapshots spanning a lookback time $t_{lb} ~4$ Gyr with 25 linearly-spaced lags from $ 0 - 2.33$ Gyr. We do not find evidence for a consistent lag between the onset of a warp and any of the aforementioned factors on the population level. However, we find significant correlations between individual time-series at various lags. These maximum correlation coefficients were significantly offset from random chance at the population level, suggesting that several of these factors do correlate with disk warping in specific situations. By examining four case studies whose maximum correlation coefficients were significantly higher than random chance, we establish clear qualitative relationships between these factors and warps. While a non-warped galaxy typically shows minimal halo tilt and figure rotation, warped galaxies can have strong/weak tilts and/or strong/weak figure rotation.

Abstract: Using a sample of 126000 late-type galaxies from the SDSS, we analyzed stellar mass as a function of the dynamical mass. Stellar masses are estimated using eight stellar population synthesis (SPS) models with constant IMF, while dynamical masses are derived from seven formulations based on Newtonian dynamics and virial equilibrium, incorporating both stellar and gas velocity dispersions. We account for key factors affecting mass estimation, including inclination, color, concentration, and S\'ersic index. The difference between dynamical and stellar mass (Delta log(M)) ranges from nearly zero to 95% of the dynamical mass, depending on mass and redshift, decreasing with increasing redshift, exhibiting a saddlelike trend at low mass and low redshift -- especially in disk-dominated LTGs, and transitioning into a steep, linear trend at higher masses and redshifts. This trend is not discrete but follows a continuous transition between morphological regimes. In the high-mass regime, the behavior resembles that of early-type galaxies. More massive or higher-redshift LTGs seem to be increasingly baryon-dominated, likely reflecting efficient baryon aggregation in compact, gas-rich early-Universe galaxies, less concentrated dark matter halos at high redshift, and dynamic gas inflows that concentrate baryons in galaxy centers, diminishing the dynamical role of dark matter. Dark matter within LTGs is at most equal to Delta log(M), depending on the impact of the IMF and SPS on stellar mass estimation. Although SPS-based stellar masses do not include the gas component, previous studies have shown that galaxies with log(M_Stellar/M_Solar) &gt; 10 at z &lt;= 0.3 are predominantly stellar-mass dominated, indicating that our sample mass estimates have minimal impact from gas exclusion. The results provide insight into the role of dark matter in determining galaxies' structure and evolution in the nearby Universe.</description>

Abstract: Context: The dynamical evolution of binary populations in embedded star clusters shapes the statistical properties of binaries observed in the Galactic field. Accurately modelling this process requires resolving both early cluster dynamics and binary interactions.
  Aims: We aim to characterize the early dynamical evolution of primordial binaries in embedded clusters and identify the key parameters that govern binary survival and disruption.
  Methods: We perform a set of direct $N$-body simulations starting from 100\% primordial binaries in a time-varying gas potential of a gas-embedded cluster. To describe the evolution of binary orbital properties, we define empirical dynamical operators for period, binding energy, and mass ratio, and calibrate them across the simulated ensemble.
  Results:The binding energy and orbital period evolve in a consistent, sigmoidal fashion. Their dynamical operators reveal that hard binaries heat the cluster and suppress wide binary formation, while a small residual population of soft binaries survives. The evolution of the mass-ratio distribution is less directly linked to dynamical processing and more shaped by internal processes such as stellar physics process in the pre-main-sequence phase. High-$q$ systems tend to be enhanced, while low-$q$ systems are prone to disruption.
  Conclusions: The binary evolution in clusters is primarily governed by binding energy and orbital period. Our model improves over previous parameterizations of the dynamical operator by allowing for the existence of wide binaries and incorporating the embedded cluster phase. For individual clusters, direct $N$-body modelling remains the only reliable approach. On Galactic scales, population synthesis methods based on the stellar dynamical operator approach developed here remain essential.</description>

      <title>GW231123: Likely a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We test possible formation scenarios for GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH spin distributions, in light of population properties built on the previous (GWTC-3) data. Our analysis shows that GW231123 belongs to the high-spin subpopulation that is naturally interpreted as hierarchical BBH mergers. By comparing the spin magnitudes and component masses of GW231123 to those of the remnants of previous mergers, we show that both components of GW231123 are multi-generation ($&gt;$2G) merger remnants, and plausibly originated from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical friction in the disks of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Polarization of reflected X-ray emission from the Sgr A molecular complex: multiple flares, multiple sources?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended X-ray emission observed in the direction of several molecular clouds in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy exhibits spectral and temporal properties consistent with the X-ray echo scenario. This concept postulates that the observed signal is a light-travel-time delayed reflection of a short ($\delta t&lt;$1.5 yr) and bright ($L_{\rm X}&gt;10^{39} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$) flare that was most probably produced a few hundred years ago by Sgr A*. This scenario predicts a distinct polarization signature for the reflected X-ray continuum, with the polarization vector being perpendicular to the direction toward the primary source and the polarization degree being determined by the scattering angle. We report the results of two deep observations of the currently brightest (in reflected emission) molecular complex Sgr A taken with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer in 2022 and 2023. We confirm the previous polarization measurement for a large region encompassing the Sgr A complex with high significance. We reveal an inconsistent polarization pattern for the brightest reflection region in its center. The X-ray polarization from this region is almost perpendicular to the expected direction in the case of Sgr A* illumination and shows smaller degree of polarization compared to the large region. This could indicate the simultaneous propagation of several illumination fronts throughout the CMZ, with the origin of one of them not being Sgr A*. The primary source could be associated with the Arches stellar cluster or a currently unknown source located closer to the illuminated cloud, potentially lowering the required luminosity of the primary source. Although significantly deeper observations with IXPE would be required to unequivocally distinguish between the scenarios, a combination of high-resolution imaging and micro-calorimetric spectroscopy offers an additional promising path forward.</description>

      <title>Environmentally-induced chaos: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of rotating black holes in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks, and halos, which can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos for the first time, mapping how environmental effects interfere with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through the formation of resonant islands and chaotic layers around transient orbital resonances in phase space--features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability dictates that all geodesics inside the resonant island share the periodicity of the resonance. Thus, the lifespan of resonances around non-Kerr objects can be significantly enhanced beyond the predicted lifetime of Kerr resonances. Consequently, these effects can leave distinct imprints on gravitational-wave signals, with significant implications for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational lensing time delays with quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational fields of astrophysical bodies bend the light around them, creating multiple paths along which light from a distant source can arrive at Earth. Measuring the difference in photon arrival time along these different paths provides a means of determining the mass of the lensing system, which is otherwise difficult to constrain. This is particularly challenging in the case of microlensing, where the images produced by lensing cannot be individually resolved; existing proposals for detecting time delays in microlensed systems are significantly constrained due to the need for large photon flux and the loss of signal coherence when the angular diameter of the light source becomes too large.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach to measuring astrophysical time delays. Our method uses exponentially fewer photons than previous schemes, enabling observations that would otherwise be impossible. Our approach, which combines a quantum-inspired algorithm and quantum information processing technologies, saturates a provable lower bound on the number of photons required to find the time delay. Our scheme has multiple applications: we explore its use both in calibrating optical interferometric telescopes and in making direct mass measurements of ongoing microlensing events. To demonstrate the latter, we present a fiducial example of microlensed stellar flares sources in the Galactic Bulge. Though the number of photons produced by such events is small, we show that our photon-efficient scheme opens the possibility of directly measuring microlensing time delays using existing and near-future ground-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>X-ray panorama of the SS433/W50 complex by SRG/eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Galactic microquasar SS 433 and the radio nebula W50 surrounding it present a prototypical example of a hyper-Eddington binary system shaping its ambient interstellar medium via energetic outflows. In this paper, we present X-ray observations of the SS 433/W50 complex by the eROSITA telescope onboard the \textit{SRG} space observatory. These data provide images of the entire nebula characterized by a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray emission. In particular, these data illustrate a close connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of W50 on scales ranging from sub-parsecs, represented by narrow X-ray bright filaments, to the entire extent of $\gtrsim 100\,{\rm pc}$ of the nebula. These data also allowed us to fully characterize a pair of nearly symmetric, sharp-edged, elongated structures aligned with the orbital axis of the binary system, which lack radio counterparts but are prominent in very-high-energy gamma-ray emission. The resulting multifaceted picture of the interaction between energetic outflows and the surrounding medium paves the way for future focused multiwavelength observations and dedicated numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic galaxy alignments in CAMELS simulations and the significant impact of baryon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detection of the intrinsic galaxy alignments in the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the alignment amplitude depends significantly on cosmological and supernova feedback parameters - specifically $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $A_{\text{SN1}}$, $A_{\text{SN2}}$- while no dependence on AGN feedback is observed (due to the limited simulation volume $(25\,h^{-1}\,\text{Mpc})^3$). The dependence on $\sigma_8$ vanishes when projected correlation functions $w_{m+}$ are normalized by matter density correlations $w_{mm}$, consistent with predictions from linear alignment models. We find alignment amplitudes in quiescent galaxies to exceed those in star-forming galaxies by an order of magnitude. Moreover, examining orientation-only correlation functions from ellipticity-normalized galaxies $\tilde w_{m+}$, we confirm that alignment signals retain sensitivity to supernova feedback across full, star forming, quiescent, and ellipticity-normalized samples. Finally, we find evidence that supernova feedback impacts alignment signals differently in star-forming versus quiescent populations, suggesting that distinct alignment mechanisms operate across galaxy types. Our results offer key insights for understanding galaxy formation and alignment models for future weak gravitational lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical mass-loss rates for Very Massive Stars. I. Investigating the wind kink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation-driven winds are ubiquitous in massive stars, but in Very Massive Stars (VMSs), mass loss dominates their evolution, chemical yields, and ultimate fate. Theoretical predictions have often relied on extrapolations of O star prescriptions, likely underestimating true VMS mass-loss rates. In the first of a series of papers on VMS wind properties, we investigate a feature predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: a mass-loss `kink' or upturn where the single-scattering limit is breached and winds transition from optically thin to optically thick. We calculate hydrodynamically consistent non-LTE atmosphere models using the PoWR$^\mathrm{HD}$ code, with a grid spanning $40-135M_\odot$ and 12-50 kK at fixed $\log(L_\star/L_\odot) = 6.0$ and solar-like metallicity with $Z=0.02$. Our models confirm the existence of the kink, where the wind optical depth crosses unity and spectral morphology shifts from O star to WNh types. The predicted location of the kink coincides with the transition stars in the Galactic Arches cluster and reproduces the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of $\log(\dot{M}_\mathrm{trans}) \approx -5.16$ from Vink &amp; Gr\"afener (2012). For the first time, we locate the kink at $\Gamma_\mathrm{e} \approx 0.43$ ($M_\star \approx 60M_\odot$) without relying on uncertain stellar masses. Above the kink, mass-loss rates scale much more steeply with decreasing mass (slope ~ 10), in qualitative agreement with MC predictions. We additionally identify two bistability jumps in the mass loss driven by Fe ionisation shifts: the first from FeIV to FeIII near 25 kK and the second from FeIII to FeII near 15 kK. Our models thus provide the first comprehensive confirmation of the VMS mass-loss kink while establishing a mass-loss relation with complex mass and temperature dependencies with consequences for stellar evolution, chemical yields, and the black hole mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic collective excitations of Bose gases in modified Newtonian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations are fundamental in quantum many-body physics, yet their spectra have traditionally been studied within Newtonian dynamics. In this paper, we investigate collective excitations in Bose gases under Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive an anisotropic excitation spectrum in the MOND regime. This anisotropy arises directly from the intrinsic nonlinear structure of the MOND Poisson equation, forming a distinctive signature of the modified gravitational response. We then analyze the Jeans instability, obtaining analytic expressions for the direction-dependent critical wavelength and mass. These results advance our understanding of collective behavior in quantum systems under modified dynamics and establish clear theoretical signatures for testing MOND-like effects in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Stellar Disruption of Axion Minihalos and Consequences for Direct Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.
  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>
