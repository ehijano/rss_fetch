      <title>Limiting performance of graphene bilayer sub-terahertz detectors at large induced band gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrically induced $p-n$ junctions in graphene bilayer (GBL) have shown superior performance for detection of sub-THz radiation at cryogenic temperatures, especially upon electrical induction of the band gap $E_g$. Still, the upper limits of responsivity and noise equivalent power (NEP) at very large $E_g$ remained unknown. Here, we study the cryogenic performance of GBL detectors at $f=0.13$ THz by inducing gaps up to $E_g \approx 90$ meV, a value close to the limits observed in recent transport experiments. High value of the gap is achieved by using high-$\kappa$ bottom hafnium dioxide gate dielectric. The voltage responsivity, current responsivity and NEP optimized with respect to doping do not demonstrate saturation with gap induction up to its maximum values. The NEP demonstrates an order-of-magnitude drop from $\sim450$ fW/Hz$^{1/2}$ in the gapless state to $\sim30$ fW/Hz$^{1/2}$ at the largest gap. At largest induced band gaps, plasmonic oscillations of responsivity become visible and important for optimization of sub-THz response.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Ionic Physical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progresses in magnetoionics offer exciting potentials to leverage its non-linearity, short-term memory, and energy-efficiency to uniquely advance the field of physical reservoir computing. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the classification of temporal data using a magneto-ionic (MI) heterostructure. The device was specifically engineered to induce non-linear ion migration dynamics, which in turn imparted non-linearity and short-term memory (STM) to the magnetization. These capabilities, key features for enabling reservoir computing, were investigated, and the role of the ion migration mechanism, along with its history-dependent influence on STM, was explained. These attributes were utilized to distinguish between sine and square waveforms within a randomly distributed set of pulses. Additionally, two important performance metrics, short-term memory and parity check capacity (PC), were quantified, yielding promising values of 1.44 and 2, respectively, comparable to those of other state-of-the-art reservoirs. Our work paves the way for exploiting the relaxation dynamics of solid-state magneto-ionic platforms and developing energy-efficient magneto-ionic reservoir computing devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitter in a plasmonic field: an orientation generalised model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a quantum emitter (QE) is placed in close proximity to a plasmonic metal nanoparticle (MNP) within an external optical field, a dipole-dipole coupling arises, resulting in a highly tunable hybrid nanosystem that surpasses the optical manipulation capabilities of the individual components. These hybrid systems enable the exploration and manipulation of optical fields at the intersection between classical and quantum phenomena. Theoretical models of this interaction have typically been limited to the extreme orientations, where the QE and plasmonic dipoles are polarised either along or perpendicular to the inter-particle axis, for analytical tractability. In this work, we generalise the semi-classical optical dipole-dipole interaction model for a two-level quantum emitter in a plasmonic field for arbitrary polarisation angles. We show that the total field experienced by the quantum emitter at intermediate angles does not necessarily align with the external input field and discuss the implications of varying the polarisation angle of the external input field.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillation in Hopf-link semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the relation between the Chern number and quantum Hall effect, searching for observables of topological invariants has been an intriguing topic. Topological Hopf-link semimetals have attracted tremendous interest, in which the conduction and valence energy bands touch at linked nodal lines. However, it is challenging to identify this sophisticated topology. We propose to use the quantum oscillation in strong magnetic fields to probe the Hopf links. For a generic model of Hopf-link semimetal that captures the linked-trivial phase transition, we figure out the phase shifts of oscillation for all Fermi pockets in all magnetic-field directions, by presenting self-consistent results from the Fermi surface tomography, Landau fan diagram, and electrical resistivity. As the magnetic field is rotated, the phase shifts exhibit a unique pattern, which could help to identify Hopf links in real materials, such as those in Li$_2$NaN.</description>

      <title>Impurity effects in twisted carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transition in strongly correlated artificial graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of graphene has provided a bench-top laboratory for quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy excitations of graphene are two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions with opposite chiralities at the $\pm$K valleys of the graphene Brillouin zone. It has been speculated that the electron-electron interactions in graphene could spontaneously break the chiral symmetry to induce a finite mass for Dirac fermions, in analogue to dynamical mass generation in elementary particles. The phenomenon is also known as the relativistic Mott transition and has not been observed in pristine graphene because the interaction strength is insufficient. Here, we report the realization of strongly correlated artificial graphene and the observation of the relativistic Mott transition in twisted WSe2 tetralayers. Using magneto transport, we show that the first $\Gamma$-valley moir\'e valence band mimics the low-energy graphene band structure. At half-band filling, the system exhibits hallmarks of massless Dirac fermions, including an anomalous Landau fan originated from a $\pi$-Berry phase and a square-root density dependence of the cyclotron mass. We tune the interaction across the semimetal-insulator transition by reducing the twist angle below about 2.7 degrees. The emergent insulator is compatible with an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator. Our results open the possibility of studying strongly correlated Dirac fermions in a condensed matter system.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Lattice Manipulation with Electric Currents and Thermal Gradients in MnSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The skyrmion lattice (SkL) in MnSi was studied using small-angle neutron scattering and under the influence of a radial electric current in a Corbino geometry. In response to the applied current, the SkL undergoes an angular reorientation with respect to the MnSi crystal lattice. The reorientation is non-monotonic with increasing current, with the SkL rotating first in one direction and then the other. The SkL reorientation was studied at different sample locations and found to depend on the local current density as inferred from a finite element analysis. The non-monotonic response indicates the presence of two competing effects on the SkL, most likely due to the presence of both radial electric and thermal currents. Such a scenario is supported by micromagnetic simulations, which show how these effects can act constructively or destructively to drive the SkL rotation, depending on the direction of the electric current. In addition, the simulations also suggest how the direction of the skyrmion flow may affect the SkL orientation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Device Resistances in the Performance of Graphene-based Terahertz Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, graphene Field-Effect-Transistors (GFETs) have demonstrated an outstanding potential for Terahertz (THz) photodetection due to their fast response and high-sensitivity. Such features are essential to enable emerging THz applications, including 6G wireless communications, quantum information, bioimaging and security. However, the overall performance of these photodetectors may be utterly compromised by the impact of internal resistances presented in the device, so-called access or parasitic resistances. In this work, we provide a detailed study of the influence of internal device resistances in the photoresponse of high-mobility dual-gate GFET detectors. Such dual-gate architectures allow us to fine tune (decrease) the internal resistance of the device by an order of magnitude and consequently demonstrate an improved responsivity and noise-equivalent-power values of the photodetector, respectively. Our results can be well understood by a series resistance model, as shown by the excellent agreement found between the experimental data and theoretical calculations. These findings are therefore relevant to understand and improve the overall performance of existing high-mobility graphene photodetectors.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum spin Hall semimetal or Fermi liquid characterized with a Z2 topological invariant, measurable through circularly polarized light. We propose its engineering through two topological metallic band structures in crystals on the honeycomb lattice, with spin-orbit interaction, realizable through the interplay of a charge or spin density wave substrate and Zeeman effects, in between a quantum spin Hall and a quantum anomalous Hall insulator. These systems show topologically protected helical edge or photo-induced currents.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian learning quantum magnets with non-local impurity tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>BATIS: Bootstrapping, Autonomous Testing, and Initialization System for Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. As the complexity of QD devices grows, manual tuning becomes increasingly infeasible, necessitating robust and scalable autotuning solutions. Tuning large arrays of QD qubits depends on efficient choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS), an automated framework designed to streamline QD device testing and initialization. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing and gate characterization. The current channel formation protocol follows a novel and scalable approach that requires a single measurement regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

Abstract: Photoinduced modification of second-harmonic generation mediated by nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in a diamond cavity is observed. Excitation of NV centres quenches the device's second-harmonic emission, and is attributed to modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ by photoionisation from the negative (NV$^-$) to neutral (NV$^0$) charge states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Flat bands on spherical surface: from Landau levels to giant-quantum-number orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands result in a divergent density of states and high sensitivity to interactions in physical systems. In this work, we compare the behavior of electrons confined to a single flat band on the surface of a sphere to those in flat bands under a magnetic field.Notably, the zero-field flat band exhibits an additional $C(2)$ symmetry, which causes electrons to symmetrically cluster on opposite sides of the sphere's center when a trapping potential is introduced, resulting in a unique form of long-range "entanglement". Moreover, the rotational symmetry of the system with zero field displays different characteristics. Our findings emphasize the distinctive role of zero-field conditions, where interactions that are short-range in real space manifest as highly long-range within the flat band, and the modifications introduced by band mixing are particularly pronounced. Importantly, We propose a preliminary experimental setup to explore the unique properties of zero-field flat bands on spherical substrates.While this approach remains hypothetical, the parameters involved are within current technological reach, suggesting the potential feasibility of realizing such a system.</description>

      <title>Charge asymmetry in the Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supplementing the Heisenberg model with a Hubbard-commuting kinetic of electrons adds to its spectrum without interference. One consequence is the precise incorporation of canonical linear spin wave theory within the time-dependent Hartree-Fock framework, as pure localization emerges from itinerant dynamics. This embedding method generalizes to all spin-1/2 models and is expected to extend to multi-orbital systems. Away from half-filling, differential tuning of doublon and holon motion imparts asymmetry to ordering and fluctuations. This suggests that, in effective electronic theories, kinetic interaction couplings are as significant as underlying band parameters when modeling asymmetric phenomena near the Mott insulator.</description>

      <title>Disordered quantum antiferromagnetism in doped semiconductors: Density of states approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the exchange interaction in a system of spatially disordered magnetic moments. A typical example of such a system is an impurity semiconductor, whose magnetic properties are associated with the exchange interaction of the impurity atoms. In this study, we consider the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which we describe by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. To calculate the magnetic properties of the disordered system, we employ the density of states method. Our calculations demonstrate a good quantitative agreement with the dependence of the Si:P magnetic susceptibility on temperature in a wide range of impurity concentrations and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Bending-strain effects in conventional superconductors and superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of bending-strain in thin films of clean, conventional superconductors (S), and the proximity-induced effect of this strain in SN bilayers with a normal metal (N), and SNS junctions with equal curvatures in each superconductor. We find that the effective spin-orbit coupling due to strain in the superconductor induces both spin-polarized and unequal-spin even-frequency p-wave triplet pairings throughout the superconductor. When interfaced with a normal metal, additional odd-frequency pairings are induced, and their magnitudes can be tuned with the strain. In SNS junctions, the strain alone can induce a superconducting spin current in the junction. The spin-polarized current can undergo a $0-\pi$-transition, resulting in an in-plane, strain-induced magnetization that switches sign as a function of the strain. We discuss the underlying physics and its implications for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission in an exponential model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of spontaneous emission can lead to the creation of an imaginary coupling and a shift. To explore this, we utilized the renormalized first Nikitin model, revealing an exponential detuning variation with a phase and an imaginary coupling along with the shift. By employing the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we investigated the behavior of our system. Our findings indicate that the imaginary coupling provides specific information, while the shift generates allowed and forbidden zones in the energy diagram of the real part of the energy. In the diagram of the imaginary part of the energy, time dictates order or chaos in the system and identifies the information transmission zone. Notably, the first Nikitin model exhibits similarities to the Rabi model in the short-time approximation. Our theoretical conclusions are consistent with numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>All-optical polarization control and routing by nonlinear interferometry at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07714v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are rapidly establishing as key-enabling platforms for nanophotonics applications. Along with the ability of taming light in subwavelength thicknesses, they can feature multiple functionalities in one device. The generation and control of light polarization by metasurfaces already provided a route towards ultracompact polarimetry devices in the linear regime. If translated to the nonlinear optical regime it may become a key-enabling tool in nonlinear imaging, optical holography and sensing. Here, we report the experimental ultrafast all-optical polarization modulation of upconverted light by all-dielectric metasurfaces via nonlinear interferometry. By controlling the relative phase between a pump beam at $\omega$ and its frequency-double replica at 2$\omega$, we can set the phase relation between two frequency-degenerate upconverted processes at 3$\omega$ $-$ Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) and Third-Harmonic Generation (THG) $-$ stemming from an AlGaAs metasurface. By exploiting the opposite parity of the two nonlinear process and tuning their relative powers, we can achieve modulation of the polarization states of the light emitted at 3$\omega$ between linear and circular states with a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) up to 83$\%$. In particular, circularly polarized light features opposite handedness symmetrically located in the Fourier space, at coincidence with the first diffraction orders of the metasurface. Moreover, by toggling the phase delay by $\pi$, the handedness can be fully switched between the diffraction. Our work adds an additional layer of modulation in polarization beyond intensity to all-optical routing with precise phase control. The capability to route circular polarization states in the k-space holds significant potential for chiral sensing and advanced imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Structural, Electronic, and Li-ion Adsorption Properties of PolyPyGY Explored by First-Principles and Machine Learning Simulations: A New Multi-Ringed 2D Carbon Allotrope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon materials have been intensively investigated because of their distinctive structural framework and electronic behaviors as alternatives in energy conversion and storage applications. This study proposes a novel 2D carbon allotrope, Polymerized Pyracyclene Graphyne (PolyPyGY), characterized by a multi-ringed structure with 4-, 5-, 6-, 8-, and 16-membered rings comprising a porous structure. Using first-principles calculations and machine-learning techniques, we explore its structural, electronic, mechanical, optical, and lithium-ion storing properties. The vibrational properties assessed through the density functional perturbation theory framework confirm its structural stability. Moreover, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at 1000 K demonstrate its thermal resilience, with no bond breaking or reconfiguration observed. The electronic band structure reveals a metallic nature, and the material exhibits anisotropic elastic properties, with Young's modulus varying between 421 and 664 GPa, suggesting good mechanical stability. Furthermore, lithium diffusion studies indicate low energy barriers (0.05-0.9 eV) and a high diffusion coefficient ( $&gt;$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ cm$^{2}$/s), along with a stable open circuit voltage of 1.2 V. These results highlight PolyPyGY's potential as a highly effective and durable anode material for lithium-ion batteries, featuring rapid Li-ion diffusion, stable intercalation, and consistent performance during charge and discharge cycles.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons and the manipulation of magnetisation via spin currents in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a maximum normalised coupling strength of 0.89. Our investigation shows the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. We compare coupling strength values derived from gap size with those calculated directly through the coupling parameter, showing that gap size as a measure of coupling strength is limited when intrinsic symmetry breaking induced magnon mode coupling is present. Additionally, analytical calculations show the possibility to reach the deep-strong coupling regime, with normalised coupling strengths greater than 1 by tuning the anisotropy values. Finally, we report on spin Hall magnetoresistance in a vdW AFM-based device and study the field and temperature dependence. These findings highlight the transformative potential of vdW AFMs in advancing the field of spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Identifying the topological order of quantized half-filled Landau levels through their daughter states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states at a half-filled Landau level are believed to carry an integer number $\mathcal{C}$ of chiral Majorana edge modes, reflected in their thermal Hall conductivity. We show that this number determines the primary series of Abelian fractional quantum Hall states that emerge above and below the half-filling point. On a particular side of half-filling, each series may originate from two consecutive values of $\mathcal{C}$, but the combination of the series above and below half-filling uniquely identifies $\mathcal{C}$. We analyze these states both by a hierarchy approach and by a composite fermion approach. In the latter, we map electrons near a half-filled Landau level to composite fermions at a weak magnetic field and show that a bosonic integer quantum Hall state is formed by pairs of composite fermions and plays a crucial role in the state's Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian theory of valley excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-hole exchange interaction in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is extremely strong due to the dimension reduction, which promises valley-superposed excitonic states with linearly polarized optical emissions. However, strong circular polarization reflecting valley-polarized excitonic states is commonly observed in helicity-resolved optical experiments. Here we present a non-Hermitian theory of valley excitons by incorporating optical pumping and intrinsic decay, which unveils an anomalous valley-polarized excitonic state with elliptically polarized optical emission. This novel state arises from the non-Hermiticity induced parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetry breaking, which impedes the experimental observation of intervalley excitonic coherence effect. At large excitonic center-of-mass momenta, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is restored and the excitonic states recover their valley coherence. Interestingly, the linear polarization directions in optical emissions from these valley-superposed excitonic states are non-orthogonal and even become parallel at exceptional points. Our non-Hermitian theory also predicts a non-zero Berry curvature for valley excitons, which admits a topological excitonic Hall transport beyond the Hermitian predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the microscopic details of the proximity effect is crucial for both key experimental applications and fundamental inquiries into nanoscale devices featuring superconducting elements. In this work, we develop a framework motivated by experiments to study induced superconducting correlations in hybrid nanoscale devices featuring layered superconductor-normal heterostructures using the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's functions. Following a detailed method for analyzing the induced pair amplitude in a prototypical one-dimensional hybrid, we provide insights into the proximity effect within and outside the Andreev approximation. Our analysis also uncovers a disorder-induced crossover in the correlation patterns of the system. By elucidating the spectral distribution of the induced pair amplitude, we investigate the pair correlations established in a recent experiment [Phys.Rev.Lett.128,127701], providing a theoretical basis for the enhanced Cooper pair injection demonstrated through the lens of the induced pair correlations, thereby establishing the promise of our methods in guiding new experiments in hybrid quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the linearly vanishing density of states, emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles resulting from the free fermion motion in a family of two-dimensional half-filled bipartite hyperbolic lattices feature dynamic mass generation through quantum phase transitions only for sufficiently strong finite-range Coulomb repulsion. As such, strong nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion ($V$) favors the nucleation of a charge-density-wave (CDW) order with a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between two sublattices of bipartite hyperbolic lattices. Considering a collection of spinless fermions (for simplicity), here we show that application of strong external magnetic fields by virtue of producing a \emph{finite} density of states near the zero energy triggers the condensation of the CDW order even for \emph{infinitesimal} $V$. The proposed curved space magnetic catalysis mechanism is operative for uniform and inhomogeneous (bell-shaped) magnetic fields. We present scaling of the CDW order with the total flux enclosed by hyperbolic Dirac materials for a wide range of (especially subcritical) $V$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing tunable functional materials with built-in nanoscale heat flow directionality represents a significant challenge that could advance thermal management strategies. Here we use spatiotemporally-resolved thermoreflectance to visualize lateral thermal transport anisotropy in self-assembled supercrystals of anisotropic Au nanocrystals. Correlative electron and thermoreflectance microscopy reveal that nano- to meso-scale heat predominantly flows along the long-axis of the anisotropic nanocrystals, and does so across grain boundaries and curved assemblies while voids disrupt heat flow. We finely control the anisotropy via the aspect ratio of constituent nanorods, and it exceeds the aspect ratio for nano-bipyramid supercrystals and certain nanorod arrangements. Finite element simulations and effective medium modeling rationalize the emergent anisotropic behavior in terms of a simple series resistance model, further providing a framework for estimating thermal anisotropy as a function of material and structural parameters. Self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals promises an interesting route to direct heat flow in a wide range of applications that utilize this important class of materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.</description>
