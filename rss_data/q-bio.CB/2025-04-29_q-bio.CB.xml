      <title>How different are self and nonself?</title>

Abstract: Biological and artificial networks routinely make reliable distinctions between similar inputs, and the rules for making these distinctions are learned. In some ways, self/nonself discrimination in the immune system is similar, being both reliable and (partly) learned through thymic selection. In contrast to other examples, we show that the distributions of self and nonself peptides are nearly identical but strongly inhomogeneous. Reliable discrimination is possible only because self-peptides are a particular finite sample drawn out of this distribution, and T cells can target the spaces in between these samples. In conventional learning problems, this would constitute overfitting and lead to disaster. Here, the strong inhomogeneities imply instead that the immune system gains by targeting peptides which are similar to self, with maximum sensitivity for sequences just one or two substitutions away. This prediction from the structure of the underlying distribution in sequence space agrees, for example, with the observed responses to mutation derived cancer neoantigens.</description>

      <title>Phenotype-structuring of non-local kinetic models of cell migration driven by environmental sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capability of cells to form surface extensions to non-locally probe the surrounding environment plays a key role in cell migration. The existing mathematical models for migration of cell populations driven by this non-local form of environmental sensing rely on the simplifying assumption that cells in the population share the same cytoskeletal properties, and thus form surface extensions of the same size. To overcome this simplification, we develop a kinetic modelling framework wherein a population of migrating cells is structured by a continuous phenotypic variable that captures variability in structural properties of the cytoskeleton. This framework provides a multiscale representation of cell migration, from single-cell dynamics to population-level behaviours, as we start with a microscopic model that describes the dynamics of single cells in terms of stochastic processes. Next, we formally derive the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which consists of a phenotype-structured kinetic equation that features a phenotype-dependent non-locality. Then, considering an appropriately rescaled version of this kinetic equation, we formally derive the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a partial differential equation for the cell number density. To validate the formal procedures employed to derive the macroscopic model from the microscopic model, through the mesoscopic one, we first compare the results of numerical simulations of the two models. We then compare numerical solutions of the macroscopic model with the results of cell locomotion assays, to test the ability of the model to recapitulate qualitative features of experimental observations.</description>
