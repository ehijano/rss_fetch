      <title>Binding groups for algebraic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binding group theorem is proved in the context of quantifier-free internality to the fixed field in difference-closed fields of characteristic zero. This is articulated as a statement about the birational geometry of isotrivial algebraic dynamical systems, and more generally isotrivial $\sigma$-varieties. It asserts that if $(V,\phi)$ is an isotrivial $\sigma$-variety then a certain subgroup of the group of birational transformations of $V$, namely those that preserve all the relations between $(V,\phi)$ and the trivial dynamics on the affine line, is in fact an algebraic group. Several application are given including new special cases of the Zariski Dense Orbit Conjecture and the Dixmier-Moeglin Equivalence Problem in algebraic dynamics, as well as finiteness results about the existence of nonconstant invariant rational functions on cartesian powers of $\sigma$-varieties. These applications give algebraic-dynamical analogues of recent results in differential-algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Uniform local weak o-minimality and $*$-local weak o-minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the notions of uniform local weak o-minimality and $*$-local weak o-minimality. Local monotonicity theorems hold in definably complete locally o-minimal structures and uniformly locally o-minimal structures of the second kind. In this paper, we demonstrate new local monotonicity theorems for uniformly locally weakly o-minimal structures of the second kind and for locally o-minimal structures under the assumption called the univariate $*$-continuity property. We also prove that several formulas for dimension of definable sets which hold in definably complete locally o-minimal structures also hold in $*$-locally weakly o-minimal structures possessing the univariate $*$-continuity property.</description>

      <title>On the logical Janus-face of weak continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuity is one of the most central notions in mathematics and related areas. An interesting related topic is decompositions of continuity, where continuity is shown to be equivalent to the combination of two or more weak continuity notions. Now, from a logical viewpoint, continuity is fairly tame in that its basic properties are readily established in rather weak logical systems. It is then a natural question whether the same holds for the aforementioned weak continuity notions. In this paper, we establish the Janus-face nature of weak continuity notions: we identify numerous weak continuity notions that are as tame as continuity, but also list a number of extremely wild weak continuity notions for which basic properties, like finding the supremum or evaluating the Riemann integral, are extremely hard to prove. To make our heuristic notions (tame, wild, weak) precise, we adopt Reverse Mathematics, a program in the foundation of mathematics that seeks to identify the minimal axioms that prove a given theorem. Particularly surprising and novel is that our `wild' theorems exist at the outer edges of Reverse Mathematics, i.e. while rather basic, they imply full second-order arithmetic.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Elementary Proof of Zorn's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zorn's Lemma is a well-known equivalent of the Axiom of Choice. It is usually regarded as a topic in axiomatic set theory, and its historically standard proof (from the Axiom of Choice) relies on transfinite recursion, a non-elementary set-theoretic machinery. However, the statement of Zorn's Lemma itself uses only elementary terminology for partially ordered sets. Therefore, it is worthy to establish a proof using only such elementary terminology. Following this line of study, we give a new simple proof of Zorn's Lemma, which does not even use the notion of a well-ordered set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple proof that the first-order theory of well orders is axiomatized by transfinite induction, and that it is decidable.</description>
