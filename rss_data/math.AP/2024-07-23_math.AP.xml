      <title>Analytic Structure of Stationary Flows of an Ideal Fluid with a Stagnation Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of an ideal fluid possesses a remarkable property: despite limited regularity of the velocity field, its particle trajectories are analytic curves. In our previous work, this fact was used to introduce the structure of an analytic Banach manifold in the set of 2D stationary flows having no stagnation points. The main feature of our description was to regard the stationary flow as a collection of its analytic flow lines, parameterized non-analytically by values of the stream function $\psi$.
  In this work, we adapt this description to the case of 2D stationary flows which have a single elliptic stagnation point. Namely, we consider flows in a domain bounded by the graph of analytic function $\rho = b(\varphi)$, where $(\rho,\varphi)$ are polar coordinates centred at the origin. The position $p$ of the stagnation point is an unknown and must be included in the solution. In polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ centred at $p$, the flow lines are described by graphs of $r=a(\psi,\theta)$, where $a$ is a `partially-analytic' function (analytic in $\theta$, of finite regularity in $\psi$). The equation of stationary flow $\Delta \psi = F(\psi)$ is transformed to the quasilinear elliptic equation $\Xi(a) = F(\psi)$ for the flow lines. The analysis is complicated by the fact that the ellipticity of $\Xi$ degenerates at the stagnation point.
  We introduce function spaces for the partially-analytic family of flow lines, modelled on the weighted Kondratev spaces, appropriate for the degenerate setting. The equation of stationary flow is thus regarded as an analytic operator equation in complex Banach spaces, with local solution given by the implicit function theorem. In particular, we show that near the circular flow of constant vorticity, the equation has unique solution $p, a(\psi,\theta)$ depending analytically on parameters $b(\varphi)$ and $F(\psi)$.</description>

      <title>Conditional regularity for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with potential temperature transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conditional regularity for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with potential temperature transport in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in\{2,3\}$, with no-slip boundary conditions. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of local-in-time strong solutions. Further, we prove a blow-up criterion for the strong solution in terms of $L^\infty$-norms for the density and the velocity.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Interface Model for Two-Phase Flows on Evolving Surfaces with Different Densities: Local Well-Posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system for two-phase flow on an evolving surface with non-matched densities is derived using methods from rational thermodynamics. For a Cahn-Hilliard energy with a singular (logarithmic) potential short time well-posedness of strong solutions together with a separation property is shown, under the assumption of a priori prescribed surface evolution. The problem is reformulated with the help of a pullback to the initial surface. Then a suitable linearization and a contraction mapping argument for the pullback system are used. In order to deal with the linearized system, it is necessary to show maximal $L^2$-regularity for the surface Stokes operator in the case of variable viscosity and to obtain maximal $L^p$-regularity for the linearized Cahn-Hilliard system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global well-posedness of strong solutions to the nonhomogeneous magnetic B\'enard system with positive density at infinity in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^2$. More precisely, we obtain the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for general large initial data. Our method relies on dedicate energy estimates and a logarithmic interpolation inequality.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for random nonlinear wave equations: weak dissipation and localized control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new criterion for exponential mixing of random dynamical systems. Our criterion is applicable to a wide range of systems, including in particular dispersive equations. Its verification is in nature related to several topics, i.e., asymptotic compactness in dynamical systems, global stability of evolution equations, and localized control problems.
  As an initial application, we exploit the exponential mixing of random nonlinear wave equations with degenerate damping, critical nonlinearity, and physically localized noise. The essential challenge lies in the fact that the weak dissipation and randomness interact in the evolution.</description>

We adapt the atomic spaces framework in the context of the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and employ probabilistic perturbation arguments in the context of stochastic PDEs, establishing the global well-posedness of the defocusing energy-critical quintic SNLS in $H^1(\mathbb{T}^3)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the fractional Hardy inequality on polarisable metric measure spaces. The integral Hardy inequality for $1&lt;p\leq q&lt;\infty$ is playing a key role in the proof. Moreover, we also prove the fractional Hardy-Sobolev type inequality on metric measure spaces. In addition, logarithmic Hardy-Sobolev and fractional Nash type inequalities on metric measure spaces are presented. In addition, we present applications on homogeneous groups and on the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>On the boundary branching set of the one-phase problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider minimizers of the one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problem in domains with analytic fixed boundary. In any dimension $d$, we prove that the branching set at the boundary has Hausdorff dimension at most $d-2$. As a consequence, we also obtain an analogous estimate on the branching set for solutions to the symmetric two-phase problem. The approach we use is based on the (almost-)monotonicity of a boundary Almgren-type frequency function, obtained via regularity estimates and a Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition in the spirit of Almgren-De Lellis-Spadaro.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Li and Zhao [5] (Bull. Math. Biol., 83(5), 43, 25 pp (2021)) proposed and studied a periodic reaction-diffusion model of Zika virus with seasonality and spatial heterogeneous structure in host and vector populations. They found the basic reproduction ratio R0, which is a threshold parameter. In this short paper we shall use the upper and lower solutions method to study the model of [5] with Neumann boundary conditions replaced by general boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A discrete crystal model in three dimensions: the line-tension limit for dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a discrete lattice model of the energy of dislocations in three-dimensional crystals which properly accounts for lattice symmetry and geometry, arbitrary harmonic interatomic interactions, elastic deformations and discrete crystallographic slip on the full complement of slip systems of the crystal class. Under the assumption of diluteness, we show that the discrete energy converges, in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence, to a line-tension energy defined on Volterra line dislocations, regarded as integral vector-valued currents supported on rectifiable curves. Remarkably, the line-tension limit is of the same form as that derived from semi-discrete models of linear elastic dislocations based on a core cutoff regularization. In particular, the line-tension energy follows from a cell relaxation and differs from the classical ansatz, which is quadratic in the Burgers vector.</description>

      <title>Reduced theory of symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions in nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of minimizers of perturbed Dirichlet energies supported on a wire generated by a regular simple curve $\gamma$ and defined in the space of $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued functions. The perturbation $K$ is represented by a matrix-valued function defined on $\mathbb{S}^2$ with values in $\mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$. Under natural regularity conditions on $K$, we show that the family of perturbed Dirichlet energies converges, in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence, to a simplified energy functional on $\gamma$. The reduced energy unveils how part of the antisymmetric exchange interactions contribute to an anisotropic term whose specific shape depends on the curvature of $\gamma$.
  We also discuss the significant implications of our results for studies of ferromagnetic nanowires when Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is present.</description>

      <title>Cross-diffusion systems coupled via a moving interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a one-dimensional model which consists of two cross-diffusion systems coupled via a moving interface. The motivation stems from the modelling of complex diffusion processes in the context of the vapor deposition of thin films. In our model, cross-diffusion of the various chemical species can be respectively modelled by a size-exclusion system for the solid phase and the Stefan-Maxwell system for the gaseous phase. The coupling between the two phases is modelled by linear phase transition laws of Butler-Volmer type, resulting in an interface evolution. The continuous properties of the model are investigated, in particular its entropy variational structure and stationary states. We introduce a two-point flux approximation finite volume scheme. The moving interface is addressed with a moving-mesh approach, where the mesh is locally deformed around the interface. The resulting discrete nonlinear system is shown to admit a solution that preserves the main properties of the continuous system, namely: mass conservation, nonnegativity, volume-filling constraints, decay of the free energy and asymptotics. In particular, the moving-mesh approach is compatible with the entropy structure of the continuous model. Numerical results illustrate these properties and the dynamics of the model.</description>

      <title>Ground states of a coupled pseudo-relativistic Hartree system: existence and concentration behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the ground states of a coupled pseudo-relativistic Hartree system in $\mathbb{R} ^{3} $ with trapping potentials, where the intraspecies and the interspecies interaction are both attractive. By investigating an associated constraint minimization problem, the existence and non-existence of ground states are classified completely. Under certain conditions on the trapping potentials, we present a precise analysis on the concentration behavior of the minimizers as the coupling coefficient goes to a critical value, where the minimizers blow up and the maximum point sequence concentrates at a global minima of the associated trapping potentials. We also identify an optimal blowing up rate under polynomial potentials by establishing some delicate estimates of energy functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the general space-time fractional diffusion equation for left-invariant hypoelliptic homogeneous operators on graded Lie groups. Our study covers important examples such as the time-fractional diffusion equation, the space-time fractional diffusion equation when diffusion is under the influence of sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group, or general stratified Lie groups. We establish the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the general space-time fractional diffusion equation for the Rockland operator on a graded Lie group in the associated Sobolev spaces. More precisely, we establish the existence and uniqueness results for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fractional diffusion equations. In addition, we also develop some regularity estimates.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Stokes equations on a wedge with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the incompressible and stationary Stokes equations on an infinite two-dimensional wedge with non-scaling invariant Navier-slip boundary conditions. We prove well-posedness and higher regularity of the Stokes problem in a certain class of weighted Sobolev spaces.
  The novelty of this work is the occurrence of two different scalings in the boundary condition, which is not treated so far for the Stokes system in unbounded wedge-type domains. These difficulties are overcome by first constructing a variational solution in a second order weighted Sobolev space and subsequently proving higher regularity up to the tip of the wedge by employing an iterative scheme. We believe that this method can be used for other problems with variational structure and multiple scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear, higher-order dispersive equations with measure (or even less regular) potentials and initial data with low regularity. Our approach is of distributional nature and relies on the phase space analysis (via Gabor wave packets) of the corresponding fundamental solution - in fact, locating the modulation/amalgam space regularity of such generalized Fresnel-type oscillatory functions is a problem of independent interest in harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>Sharp commutator estimates of all order for Coulomb and Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove functional inequalities in any dimension controlling the iterated derivatives along a transport of the Coulomb or super-Coulomb Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the second author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where control of such derivatives by the energy itself is an essential ingredient. In this paper, we extend and improve such functional inequalities, proving estimates which are now sharp in their additive error term, in their density dependence, valid at arbitrary order of differentiation, and localizable to the support of the transport. Our method relies on the observation that these iterated derivatives are the quadratic form of a commutator. Taking advantage of the Riesz nature of the interaction, we identify these commutators as solutions to a degenerate elliptic equation with a right-hand side exhibiting a recursive structure in terms of lower-order commutators and develop a local regularity theory for the commutators, which may be of independent interest.
  These estimates have applications to obtaining sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and in proving central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases. In particular, we show here the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Delta-shock for the pressureless Euler-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study singularity formation for the pressureless Euler-Poisson system of cold ion dynamics. In contrast to the Euler-Poisson system with pressure, when its smooth solutions experience $C^1$ blow-up, the $L^\infty$ norm of the density becomes unbounded, which is often referred to as a delta-shock. We provide a constructive proof of singularity formation to obtain an exact blow-up profile and the detailed asymptotic behavior of the solutions near the blow-up point in both time and space. Our result indicates that at the blow-up time $t=T_\ast$, the density function is unbounded but is locally integrable with the profile of $\rho(x,T_\ast) \sim (x-x_*)^{-2/3}$ near the blow-up point $x=x_\ast$. This profile is not yet a Dirac measure. On the other hand, the velocity function has $C^{1/3}$ regularity at the blow-up point. Loosely following our analysis, we also obtain an exact blow-up profile for the pressureless Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Inverse random potential scattering for the polyharmonic wave equation using far-field patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse scattering problem of a random potential associated with the polyharmonic wave equation in two and three dimensions. The random potential is represented as a centered complex-valued generalized microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field, where its covariance and relation operators are characterized as conventional pseudo-differential operators. Regarding the direct scattering problem, the well-posedness is established in the distribution sense for sufficiently large wavenumbers through analysis of the corresponding Lippmann--Schwinger integral equation. Furthermore, in the context of the inverse scattering problem, the uniqueness is attained in recovering the microlocal strengths of both the covariance and relation operators of the random potential. Notably, this is accomplished with only a single realization of the backscattering far-field patterns averaged over the high-frequency band.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao Gradient Flow: Geodesic Convexity and Functional Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of probability density functions has been extensively studied in science and engineering to understand physical phenomena and facilitate algorithmic design. Of particular interest are dynamics that can be formulated as gradient flows of energy functionals under the Wasserstein metric. The development of functional inequalities, such as the log-Sobolev inequality, plays a pivotal role in analyzing the convergence of these dynamics. The goal of this paper is to parallel the success of techniques using functional inequalities, for dynamics that are gradient flows under the Fisher-Rao metric, with various $f$-divergences as energy functionals. Such dynamics take the form of a nonlocal differential equation, for which existing analysis critically relies on using the explicit solution formula in special cases. We provide a comprehensive study on functional inequalities and the relevant geodesic convexity for Fisher-Rao gradient flows under minimal assumptions. A notable feature of the obtained functional inequalities is that they do not depend on the log-concavity or log-Sobolev constants of the target distribution. Consequently, the convergence rate of the dynamics (assuming well-posed) is uniform across general target distributions, making them potentially desirable dynamics for posterior sampling applications in Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for coupled nonlocal nonlinear systems arising in mathematical biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and study several inverse problems of determining unknown parameters in nonlocal nonlinear coupled PDE systems, including the potentials, nonlinear interaction functions and time-fractional orders. In these coupled systems, we enforce non-negativity of the solutions, aligning with realistic scenarios in biology and ecology. There are several salient features of our inverse problem study: the drastic reduction in measurement/observation data due to averaging effects, the nonlinear coupling between multiple equations, and the nonlocality arising from fractional-type derivatives. These factors present significant challenges to our inverse problem, and such inverse problems have never been explored in previous literature. To address these challenges, we develop new and effective schemes. Our approach involves properly controlling the injection of different source terms to obtain multiple sets of mean flux data. This allows us to achieve unique identifiability results and accurately determine the unknown parameters. Finally, we establish a connection between our study and practical applications in biology, further highlighting the relevance of our work in real-world contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Lane-Emden problem on planar domains. When the exponent is large, the existence and multiplicity of solutions strongly depend on the geometric properties of the domain, which also deeply affect their qualitative behavior. Remarkably, a wide variety of solutions, both positive and sign-changing, have been found when the exponent is sufficiently large. In this paper, we focus on this topic and fine new sign-changing solutions that exhibit an unexpected concentration phenomenon as the exponent approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>A Hamilton-Jacobi approach to road-field reaction-diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the road-field reaction-diffusion model introduced by Berestycki, Roquejoffre, and Rossi. By performing a "thin-front limit," we are able to deduce a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a suitable effective Hamiltonian on the road that governs the front location of the road-field model. Our main motivation is to apply the theory of strong (flux-limited) viscosity solutions in order to determine a control formulation interpretation of the front location. In view of the ecological meaning of the road-field model, this is natural as it casts the invasion problem as one of finding optimal paths that balance the positive growth rate in the field with the fast diffusion on the road.
  Our main contribution is a nearly complete picture of the behavior on two-road conical domains. When the diffusivities on each road are the same, we show that the propagation speed in each direction in the cone can be computed via those associated with one-road half-space problem. When the diffusivities differ, we show that the speed along the faster road is unchanged, while the speed along the slower road can be enhanced. Along the way we provide a new proof of known results on the one-road half-space problem via our approach.</description>

      <title>On the stability of blowup solutions to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in R^d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the idea in \cite{HNWarXiv24}, we establish stability of the type-I blowup with log correction for the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. In the amplitude-phase representation, a generalized dynamic rescaling formulation is introduced, with modulation parameters capturing the spatial translation and rotation symmetries of the equation and novel additional modulation parameters perturbing the scaling symmetry. This new formulation provides enough degrees of freedom to impose normalization conditions on the rescaled solution, completely eliminating the unstable and neutrally stable modes of the linearized operator around the blowup profile. It enables us to establish the full stability of the blowup by enforcing vanishing conditions via the choice of normalization and using weighted energy estimates, without relying on a topological argument or a spectrum analysis. The log correction for the blowup rate is captured by the energy estimates and refined estimates of the modulation parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems driven by non-linear parabolic partial differential equations with initial condition $\theta$ modelled by a Gaussian process `prior' probability measure. Given discrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains updated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible trajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these non-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance for the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We demonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction diffusion equations \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u - \Delta u &amp;= f(u) \\ u(0) &amp;= \theta \end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly supported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be characterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with `rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>

      <title>Stationary Solitons in discrete NLS with non-nearest neighbour interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a construction of stationary discrete solitons in an extended one-dimensional Discrete NLS model with non-nearest neighbour interactions. These models, models of the type with long-range interactions were studied in various other contexts. In particular, it was shown that, if the interaction strength decays sufficiently slowly as a function of distance, it gives rise to bistability of solitons, which may find applications in their controllable switching. Dynamical lattices with long-range interactions also serve as models for energy and charge transport in biological molecules. Using a dynamical systems method we are able to construct, with great accuracy, stationary discrete solitons for our model, for a large region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>On local solubility of Bao--Ratiu equations on surfaces related to the geometry of diffeomorphism group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the existence of asymptotic directions for the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of a closed 2-dimensional surface $(\Sigma,g)$ within the full diffeomorphism group, described by the Bao--Ratiu equations, a system of second-order PDEs introduced in [On a non-linear equation related to the geometry of the diffeomorphism group, Pacific J. Math. 158 (1993); On a non-linear equation related to the geometry of the diffeomorphism group, Pacific J. Math. 158 (1993)]. It is known [The Bao--Ratiu equations on surfaces, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 449 (1995)] that asymptotic directions cannot exist globally on any $\Sigma$ with positive curvature. To complement this result, we prove that asymptotic directions always exist locally about a point $x_0 \in \Sigma$ in either of the following cases (where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature on $\Sigma$): (a), $K(x_0)&gt;0$; (b) $K(x_0)&lt;0$; or (c), $K$ changes sign cleanly at $x_0$, i.e., $K(x_0)=0$ and $\nabla K(x_0) \neq 0$. The key ingredient of the proof is the analysis following Han [On the isometric embedding of surfaces with Gauss curvature changing sign cleanly, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 58 (2005)] of a degenerate Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation -- which is of the elliptic, hyperbolic, and mixed types in cases (a), (b), and (c), respectively -- locally equivalent to the Bao--Ratiu equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of stabilization of $1$-D parabolic equations with destabilizing terms and Dirichlet boundary disturbances. By using the method of backstepping and the technique of splitting, a boundary feedback controller is designed to ensure the input-to-state stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system with Dirichlet boundary disturbances, while preserving fixed-time stability (FTS) of the corresponding disturbance-free system, for which the fixed time is either determined by the Riemann zeta function or freely prescribed. To overcome the difficulty brought by Dirichlet boundary disturbances, the ISS and FTS properties of the involved systems are assessed by applying the generalized Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme of control design.</description>

      <title>Voltage mapping in subcellular nanodomains using electro-diffusion modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voltage distribution in sub-cellular micro-domains such as neuronal synapses, small protrusions or dendritic spines regulates the opening and closing of ionic channels, energy production and thus cellular homeostasis and excitability. Yet how voltage changes at such a small scale in vivo remains challenging due to the experimental diffraction limit, large signal fluctuations and the still limited resolution of fast voltage indicators. Here, we study the voltage distribution in nano-compartments using a computational approach based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for the electro-diffusion motion of ions, where inward and outward fluxes are generated between channels. We report a current-voltage (I-V) logarithmic relationship generalizing Nernst law that reveals how the local membrane curvature modulates the voltage. We further find that an influx current penetrating a cellular electrolyte can lead to perturbations from tens to hundreds of nanometers deep depending on the local channels organization. Finally, we show that the neck resistance of dendritic spines can be completely shunted by the transporters located on the head boundary, facilitating ionic flow. To conclude, we propose that voltage is regulated at a subcellular level by channels organization, membrane curvature and narrow passages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following advances in the theory of composites we develop rapidly converging series expansions about $z=\infty$ for the resolvent ${\bf R}(z)=[z{\bf I}-{\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}]^{-1}$ where ${\bf Q}$ is an orthogonal projection and ${\bf P}$ is such that ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf P}={\bf I}$ while $\Gamma={\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ is an orthogonal projection. It is assumed that the spectrum of ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}$ lies within the interval $[z^-,z^+]$ for some known $z^+\leq 1$ and $z^-\geq 0$. The series converges in the entire $z$-plane excluding the cut $[z^-,z^+]$. It is obtained using subspace substitution, where the desired resolvent is tied to a resolvent in a larger space and ${\bf Q}$ gets replaced by a projection $\underline{\bf Q}$ that is no longer orthogonal.</description>

      <title>Infectious Diseases Spreading Fought by Multiple Vaccines Having a Prescribed Time Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for the description of the effects of vaccinations on the spreading of an epidemic disease. Different vaccines can be dosed, each providing different immunization times and immunization levels. Differences due to individuals' ages are accounted for through the introduction of either a continuous age structure or a discrete set of age classes. Extensions to gender differences or to distinguish fragile individuals can also be considered. Within this setting, vaccination strategies can be simulated, tested and compared, as is explicitly described through numerical integrations.</description>

      <title>Approximate boundary controllability for parabolic equations with inverse square infinite potential wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heat operators on a bounded domain $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, with a critically singular potential diverging as the inverse square of the distance to $\partial \Omega$. While null boundary controllability for such operators was recently proved in all dimensions in arXiv:2112.04457, it crucially assumed (i) $\Omega$ was convex, (ii) the control must be prescribed along all of $\partial \Omega$, and (iii) the strength of the singular potential must be restricted to a particular subrange. In this article, we prove instead a definitive approximate boundary control result for these operators, in that we (i) do not assume convexity of $\Omega$, (ii) allow for the control to be localized near any $x_0 \in \partial \Omega$, and (iii) treat the full range of strength parameters for the singular potential. Morever, we lower the regularity required for $\partial \Omega$ and the lower-order coefficients. The key novelty is a local Carleman estimate near $x_0$, with a carefully chosen weight that takes into account both the appropriate boundary conditions and the local geometry of $\partial \Omega$.</description>

      <title>A Payne-Whitham model of urban traffic networks in the presence of traffic lights and its application to traffic optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban road transport is a major civilisational and economic challenge, affecting the quality of life and economic activity. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach and sustainable urban planning strategies to mitigate the negative effects of traffic in cities. In this paper, we introduce an extension of one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation models, the Payne-Whitham model. We investigate how this model, originally designed to model highway traffic on straight road segments, can be adapted to more realistic conditions with arbitrary road network graphs and multiple intersections with traffic signals. Furthermore, we showcase the practical application of this extension in experiments aimed at optimising traffic signal settings. For computational reasons, these experiments involve the adoption of surrogate models for approximating our extended Payne-Whitham model, and subsequently, we utilise the Differential Evolution optimization algorithm, resulting in the identification of traffic signal settings that enhance the average speed of cars and decrease the total length of queues, thereby facilitating smoother traffic flow.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard system with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general class of bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard systems with dynamic boundary conditions. In contrast to classical Neumann boundary conditions, the dynamic boundary conditions of Cahn--Hilliard type allow for dynamic changes of the contact angle between the diffuse interface and the boundary, a convection-induced motion of the contact line as well as absorption of material by the boundary. The coupling conditions for bulk and surface quantities involve parameters $K,L\in[0,\infty]$, whose choice declares whether these conditions are of Dirichlet, Robin or Neumann type. We first prove the existence of a weak solution to our model in the case $K,L\in (0,\infty)$ by means of a Faedo--Galerkin approach. For all other cases, the existence of a weak solution is then shown by means of the asymptotic limits, where $K$ and $L$ are sent to zero or to infinity, respectively. Eventually, we establish higher regularity for the phase-fields, and we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions given that the mobility functions are constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a one dimensional porous media equation with a spatially periodic reaction. We first construct a periodic traveling wave whose profile tends to a positive steady state at left infinity and takes zero on the right half line, with a free boundary satisfying the Darcy's law. Our method is to take the limit for a sequence of normalized solutions starting at Heaviside type of initial data. The main difficulty is to give a uniform positive lower bound for the instantaneous speed of the free boundary.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Gaussian Minkowski Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article delves into the $L_p$ Minkowski problem within the framework of generalized Gaussian probability space. This type of probability space was initially introduced in information theory through the seminal works of Lutwak, Yang, and Zhang [49,50], as well as by Lutwak, Lv, Yang, and Zhang [45]. The primary focus of this article lies in examining the existence of this problem. While the variational method is employed to explore the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the normalized Minkowski problem when $p \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, our main emphasis is on the existence of the generalized Gaussian Minkowski problem without the normalization requirement, particularly in the smooth category for $p \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Linearized Boltzmann collision operator for a mixture of monatomic and polyatomic chemically reacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At higher altitudes, for high temperature gases, for instance near space shuttles moving at hypersonic speed, not only mechanical collisions are affecting the gas flow, but also chemical reactions have an impact on such hypersonic flows. In this work we insert chemical reactions, in form of dissociations and recombinations (associations), in an existing model for a mixture of mono- and polyatomic (non-reacting) species. More general chemical reactions, e.g., bimolecular ones, can be obtained by instant combinations of associations and dissociations. The polyatomicity is modelled by a continuous internal energy variable and the evolution of the gas is described by a Boltzmann equation.
  In, e.g., the Chapman-Enskog process - and related half-space problems - the linearized Boltzmann collision operator plays a central role. Here we extend some important properties of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator to the introduced model with chemical reactions. A compactness result, stating that the linearized operator can be decomposed into a sum of a positive multiplication operator - the collision frequency - and a compact integral operator, is proven under reasonable assumptions on the collision kernel. The strategy is to show that the terms of the integral operator are (at least) uniform limits of Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators and therefore also compact operators. Self-adjointness of the linearized operator is a direct consequences. Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the collision frequency are obtained for hard sphere like, as well as hard potentials with cutoff like models. As consequence, Fredholmness, as well as, the domain, of the linearized collision operator are obtained</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonlinear stability for the 3-D planar helical flow $(\delta^2\sin(m_0 y),\delta^2\cos(m_0 y),0)$ on torus $\mathbb{T}^3=\{(x_1,x_2,y)\big|x_1,x_2\in \mathbb{T}_{2\pi}, y\in \mathbb{T}_{2\pi \delta}, \delta\geq1\}$ for high Reynolds number $Re$. We prove that if the initial velocity $U_0$ satisfies $$ \left\|U_0-(\delta^2\sin(m_0 y),\delta^2\cos(m_0 y),0)\right\|_{X_0}\leq c_0 Re^{-7/4} $$ for some $c_0&gt;0$ independent of $Re$, then the solution of 3-D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is global in time and does not transit away from the planar helical flow. Here $\delta&gt;1, m_0=\delta^{-1}$ and the norm $\|\cdot\|_{X_0}$ is defined in (1.8). This is a nonlinear stability result for 3-D non-shear flow and the transition threshold is less than $7/4$.</description>

      <title>Concavity and perturbed concavity for $p$-Laplace equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study convexity properties for quasilinear Lane-Emden-Fowler equations of the type $$ \begin{cases} -\Delta_p u = a(x) u^q &amp; \quad \hbox{ in $\Omega$},\\ u &gt;0 &amp; \quad \hbox{ in $\Omega$}, \\ u =0 &amp; \quad \hbox{ on $\partial \Omega$}, \end{cases} $$ when $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a convex domain. In particular, in the subhomogeneous case $q \in [0,p-1]$, the solution $u$ inherits concavity properties from $a$ whenever assumed, while it is proved to be concave up to an error if $a$ is near to a constant. More general cases are also taken into account, including a wider class of nonlinearities. These results generalize some contained in [Kennington, Indiana Univ. Math. J., 1985] and [Sakaguchi, Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa, 1987].
  Additionally, some results for the singular case $q \in [-1,0)$ and the superhomogeneous case $q&gt;p-1$, $q \approx p-1$ are obtained. Some properties for the $p$-fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s_p$, $s\in (0,1)$, $s \approx 1$, are shown as well.
  We highlight that some results are new even in the semilinear case $p=2$; in some of these cases, we deduce also uniqueness (and nondegeneracy) of the critical point of $u$.</description>

Abstract: We give a partial negative answer to a question left open in a previous work by Brasco and the first and third-named authors concerning the sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality on convex sets. Our approach has a geometrical flavor and equivalently reformulates the sharp constant in the limit case $p=1$ as the Cheeger constant for the fractional perimeter and the Lebesgue measure with a suitable weight. As a by-product, we obtain new lower bounds on the sharp constant in the $1$-dimensional case, even for non-convex sets, some of which optimal in the case $p=1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Boltzmann equation for a polyatomic gas. We establish that the mild solution to the Boltzmann equation on the torus is globally well-posed, provided the initial data that satisfy bounded velocity-weighted $L^{\infty}$ norm and the smallness condition on the initial relative entropy. Furthermore, we also study the asymptotic behavior of solutions, converging to the global Maxwellian with an exponential rate. A key point in the proof is to develop the pointwise estimate on the gain term of non-linear collision operator for Gr\"{o}nwall's argument.</description>

Abstract: Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous equilibrium that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and non linear stability of a kinetic sheath equilibrium for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller that the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we prove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We adapt and extend the Montiel-Ros methodology to compact manifolds with boundary, allowing for mixed (including oblique) boundary conditions and also accounting for the action of a finite group $G$ together with an additional twisting homomorphism $\sigma\colon G\to\operatorname O(1)$. We then apply this machinery in order to obtain quantitative lower and upper bounds on the growth rate of the Morse index of free boundary minimal surfaces with respect to the topological data (i. e. the genus and the number of boundary components) of the surfaces in question. In particular, we compute the exact values of the equivariant Morse index and nullity for two infinite families of examples, with respect to their maximal symmetry groups, and thereby derive explicit two-sided linear bounds when the equivariance constraint is lifted.</description>

      <title>An analytic approach to Lefschetz and Morse theory on stratified pseudomanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic framework for Lefschetz fixed point theory and Morse theory for Hilbert complexes on stratified pseudomanifolds. We develop formulas for both global and local Lefschetz numbers and Morse, Poincar\'e polynomials as (polynomial) supertraces over cohomology groups of Hilbert complexes, developing techniques for relating local and global quantities using heat kernel and Witten deformation based methods. We focus on the case where the metric is wedge and the Hilbert complex is associated to a Dirac-type operator and satisfies the Witt condition, constructing Lefschetz versions of Bismut-Cheeger $\mathcal{J}$ forms for local Lefschetz numbers of Dirac operators, with specialized formulas for twisted de Rham, Dolbeault and spin$^{\mathbb{C}}$ Dirac complexes as supertraces of geometric endomorphisms on cohomology groups of local Hilbert complexes. We construct geometric endomorphisms to define de Rham Lefschetz numbers for some self-maps for which the pullback does not induce a bounded operator on $L^2$ forms. A de Rham Witten instanton complex is constructed for Witt spaces with stratified Morse functions, proving Morse inequalities related to other results in the literature including Goresky and MacPherson's in intersection cohomology. We also prove a Lefschetz-Morse inequality for geometric endomorphisms on the instanton complex that is new even on smooth manifolds. We derive $L^2$ Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch formulas, which we compare and contrast with algebraic versions of Baum-Fulton-Quart. In the complex setting, we derive Lefschetz formulas for spin Dirac complexes and Hirzebruch $\chi_y$ genera which we relate to signature, self-dual and anti-self-dual Lefschetz numbers, studying their properties and applications including instanton counting. We compute these invariants in various examples with different features, comparing with versions in other cohomology theories.</description>

Abstract: A level orbit of a mechanical Hamiltonian system is a solution of Newton equation that is contained in a level set of the potential energy. In 2003, Mark Levi asked for a characterization of the smooth potential energy functions on the plane with the property that any point on the plane lies on a level orbit; we call such functions Levi potentials. The basic examples are the radial monotone increasing smooth functions. In this paper we show that any Levi potential that is analytic or has totally path-disconnected critical set must be radial. Nevertheless, we show that every compact convex subset of the plane is the critical set of a Levi potential. A crucial observation for these theorems is that, outside the critical set, the family of level sets of a Levi potential forms a solution of the inverse curvature flow.</description>

Abstract: We set up, at the abstract Hilbert space setting, the general question on when an inverse linear problem induced by an operator of Friedrichs type admits solutions belonging to (the closure of) the Krylov subspace associated to such operator. Such Krylov solvability of abstract Friedrichs systems allows to predict when, for concrete differential inverse problems, truncation algorithms can or cannot reproduce the exact solutions in terms of approximants from the Krylov subspace.</description>
