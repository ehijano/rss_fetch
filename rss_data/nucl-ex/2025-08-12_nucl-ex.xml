      <title>Ultra-pure Nickel for Structural Components of Low-Radioactivity Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of rare-event search experiments in nuclear and particle physics demand structural materials combining exceptional mechanical strength with ultra-low levels of radioactive contamination. This study evaluates chemical vapor deposition (CVD) nickel as a candidate structural material for such applications. Manufacturer-supplied CVD Ni grown on aluminum substrates underwent tensile testing before and after welding alongside standard Ni samples. CVD Ni exhibited a planar tensile strength of ~600 MPa, significantly surpassing standard nickel. However, welding and heat treatment were found to reduce the tensile strength to levels comparable to standard Ni, with observed porosity in the welds likely contributing to this reduction. Material assay via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) employing isotope-dilution produced measured bulk concentration of 232-Th, 238-U, and nat-K at the levels of ~70 ppq, &lt;100 ppq, and ~900 ppt, respectively, which is the lowest reported in nickel. Surface-etch profiling uncovered higher concentrations of these contaminants extending ~10 micrometer beneath the surface, likely associated with the aluminum growth substrate. The results reported are compared to the one other well documented usage of CVD Ni in a low radioactive background physics research experiment and a discussion is provided on how the currently reported results may arise from changes in CVD fabrication or testing process. These results establish CVD Ni as a promising low-radioactivity structural material, while outlining the need for further development in welding and surface cleaning techniques to fully realize its potential in large-scale, low radioactive background rare-event search experiments.</description>

      <title>Half-life Measurements of Highly Charged Radioisotopes by Nuclear Recoil in a Penning Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the half-life of highly charged radioisotopes by non-destructive nuclear recoil detection in a Penning ion trap. A specific emphasis is placed on $\rm ^7Be^{3+}$, which plays a crucial role in stellar evolution and the production of solar neutrinos. The determination of the half-life is necessary to constrain the free electron capture rate in the solar environment, but is difficult to measure by existing techniques. Simulations of the sympathetic cooling of the recoiled daughter nuclei ($\rm ^7Li^{3+}$) with the trapped cloud of $\rm ^7Be^{3+}$ demonstrate a decay detection efficiency of $99.5\%$. A statistical analysis of half-life measurements on ensembles containing hundreds of ions shows that a final statistical uncertainty of less than $5\%$ is achieved with only 500 measured decays. By coherent control of hyperfine populations in trapped ions, the fidelity of the technique we describe enables the direct measurement and manipulation of state-dependent decay branching ratios for the first time.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Silicon Tracker in sPHENIX at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sPHENIX collaboration has been taking data since 2023 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in BNL to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma and cold Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The tracking system of sPHENIX consists of a time projection chamber, a MAPS-based vertex detector, and an intermediate silicon tracker (INTT). Together with the sPHENIX full barrel calorimeter system, the measurement of the heavy-flavor jets and the upsilon-state identification are enabled. INTT, surrounding the collision point azimuthally at approximately 10 cm away with two layers of silicon strip sensors, detects hit points in the intermediate area of the tracking system to enhance tracking precision. Thanks to the good timing resolution of INTT, it also provides timing information to corresponding hits of other tracking detectors. This capability eliminates pile-up events due to misidentifying bunch crossings. This proceeding discusses the achievements of INTT using Au+Au collision data taken in 2023, and the status of INTT commissioning with proton+proton collisions in 2024.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for 3D Characterization of AGATA Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise localization of gamma-ray interactions is crucial for the performance of AGATA. The Pulse Shape Analysis (PSA) method used for the position estimation relies on simulated signals database. The Pulse Shape Comparison Scanning (PSCS) method was used to scan AGATA crystals in order to produce an experimental database. This paper presents a novel approach using LSTM neural networks to determine the 3D interaction position of gamma rays within AGATA crystals, trained on data from the Strasbourg scanning tables, allowing for constructing experimental database. A custom masked loss function is introduced to enable training with incomplete position information. The database generated by this new method outperforms the simulated database used so far, and the experimental database obtained from the conventional PSCS algorithm. Crucially, the neural network approach effectively generalizes even when trained with only one known coordinate per interaction, paving the way for simplified 1D scanning procedures.</description>

      <title>Radiation-tolerant polarized solid target</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized targets evolved into indispensable tools in particle and nuclear physics. However, the polarized solid target is degraded by high-intense beam irradiation, known as radiation damage due to target heating and radical generation. We demonstrated a radiation-tolerant polarized solid target operating at room temperature. An annealing allows the spontaneous repair of the damage by reducing unwanted radicals. Using a single crystal of $\it p$-terphenyl doped with 0.01 mol\% pentacene-$\it d$$_{14}$, Dynamic Nuclear Polarization using photoexcited triplet electrons (Triplet-DNP) was applied to proton spins at room temperature and in 0.39 T. For the proof of concept, a deuteron beam with an energy of 135 MeV/u and the intensities of 10$^7$-10$^9$ counts per second (cps) was irradiated. The proton polarization was determined to be 3.0\% $\pm$0.2\%$\rm{{(stat.)}}$ $\pm$0.1\%$\rm {{(sys.)}}$ from a scattering asymmetry. The polarization was almost not attenuated up to 10$^9$ cps, but the target crystal was yellowed. The visible-light absorption spectroscopy suggested irreversible radiation damage due to missing protons by the knock-out reaction. The room-temperature polarized solid target allows impractical experiments with the conventional target system, leading to a next-generation spin-dependent accelerator science.</description>

      <title>Experimental Scheme for Polarizing the Boron Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unravelling the internal structure of hadrons and nuclei in terms of the quarks and gluons of Quantum Chromodynamics is a central focus of current nuclear physics research. Directly observing gluonic states in the nucleus would be groundbreaking and is an objective of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Over thirty years ago, Jaffe and Manohar identified a new double-helicity flip structure function, directly sensitive to exotic gluons. They pointed out that this could be measured in inclusive high-energy electron scattering from a transversely polarized nuclear target with spin $I \ge 1$. Here, we identify the spin-3 nucleus boron-10 as a particularly interesting system to search for exotic gluons. Leveraging technical advances in atomic physics over the past decade, we outline an experimental scheme to directly optically pump a beam of stable boron atoms to polarize the nuclear spin. Technical challenges to realize a spin-polarized beam of boron-10 in the EIC are discussed. The proposed scheme will also polarize the $^{11}$B nucleus, which could significantly enhance the pB fusion cross section.</description>

      <title>Puzzle for the Vector Meson Threshold Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-statistics total cross sections for the vector meson photoproduction at the threshold: $\gamma p\to\omega p$ (from A2 at MAMI, ELPH, and CBELSA/TAPS), $\gamma p\to \phi p$ (from CLAS and LEPS), and $\gamma p\to J/\psi p$ (from GlueX) allow one to extract the absolute value of vector meson nucleon scattering length using Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) model. The ``young'' vector meson hypothesis may explain the fact that the obtained scattering length value for the nucleon $\phi$-meson compared to the typical hadron size of approximately $\sim1~\mathrm{fm}$ indicates that the proton is more transparent for the $\phi$-meson compared to the $\omega$-meson and is much less transparent than the $J/\psi$-meson. The extended analysis of $\Upsilon$-meson photoproduction using quasi-data from the QCD approach is in perfect agreement with the light-meson findings using experimental data.
  Future high-quality experiments by EIC and EicC will have the opportunity to evaluate cases for $J/\psi$- and $\Upsilon$-mesons. It allows one to understand the dynamics of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ production at the threshold. The ability of J-PARC to measure $\pi^- p\to \phi n$ and $\pi^-p\to J/\psi n$, which are free from the VMD model, is considered.</description>

      <title>Partial pressure and susceptibilities of charmed sector in the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the general susceptibilities in the charm sector by using the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model (VDWHRG). We argue that the ideal hadron resonance gas (HRG), which assumes no interactions between hadrons, and the excluded volume hadron resonance gas (EVHRG), which includes only repulsive interactions, fail to explain the lQCD data at very high temperatures. In contrast, the VDWHRG model, incorporating both attractive and repulsive interactions, extends the degree of agreement with lQCD up to nearly 180 MeV. We estimate the partial pressure in the charm sector and study charm susceptibility ratios in a baryon-rich environment, which is tricky for lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) due to the fermion sign problem. Our study further solidifies the notion that the hadrons shouldn't be treated as non-interacting particles, especially when studying higher order fluctuations, but rather one should consider both attractive and repulsive interactions between the hadrons.</description>

      <title>Vector meson dominance in photon structure functions at small $x$ from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the photon structure functions via the photon-photon and photon-vector meson scattering within the framework of holographic QCD, focusing on the small Bjorken $x$ region and assuming that the Pomeron exchange dominates. The quasi-real photon structure functions are formulated as the convolution of the known U(1) vector field wave function with the Brower-Polchinski-Strassler-Tan (BPST) Pomeron exchange kernel in the five-dimensional AdS space. Assuming the vector meson dominance, the photon structure functions can be calculated in a different way with the BPST kernel and vector meson gravitational form factor, which can be obtained in a bottom-up AdS/QCD model, for the Pomeron-vector meson coupling. It is shown that the obtained $F_2$ structure functions in the both ways agree with the experimental data, which implies the realization of the vector meson dominance within the present model setup. Calculations for the longitudinal structure function and the longitudinal-to-transverse ratio are also presented.</description>

      <title>Convergence on the Proton Drip-Line in Thulium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10259v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct observation of proton emission for very small Q-values is often unfeasible due to the long partial half-lives of the proton emission channel associated with tunneling through the Coulomb barrier. Therefore, proton emitters with very small decay energies may require the masses of both parent and daughter nuclei in order to establish them as proton unbound. Nuclear mass models have been used to predict the proton drip-line of the thulium (Tm) isotopic chain ($Z=69$), but until now the proton separation energy has not been experimentally tested. Mass measurements were performed using a Multiple Reflection Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (MR-TOF-MS) at TRIUMF's TITAN facility to conclusively map the limit of proton-bound Tm. The masses of neutron-deficient, $^{149}$Tm and $^{150}$Tm, combined with measurements of $^{149m,g}$Er (which were found to deviate from literature by $\approx$150 keV), provide the first experimental confirmation that $^{149}$Tm is the first proton-unbound nuclide in the Tm chain. Our measurements also enable the strength of the $N=82$ neutron shell gap to be determined at the Tm proton drip-line, providing evidence supporting its continued existence.</description>

      <title>Exploring $\beta$ decay and $\beta$-delayed neutron emission in exotic $^{46,47}$Cl isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, $\beta^-$ and $\beta$-delayed neutron decays of $^{46,47}$Cl are reported from an experiment carried out at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory using the Beta Counting System. The half-lives of both $^{46}$Cl and $^{47}$Cl were extracted. Based on the delayed $\gamma$-ray transitions observed, the level structure of $N = 28$ $^{46}$Ar was determined. Completely different sets of excited states above the first $2^+$ state in $^{46}$Ar were populated in the $^{46}$Cl $\beta0n$ and $^{47}$Cl $\beta1n$ decay channels. Two new $\gamma$-ray transitions in $^{47}$Ar were identified from the very weak $^{47}$Cl $\beta0n$ decay. Furthermore, $^{46}$Cl $\beta1n$ and $^{47}$Cl $\beta2n$ were also observed to yield different population patterns for levels in $^{45}$Ar, including states of different parities. The experimental results allow us to address some of the open questions related to the delayed neutron emission process. For isotopes with large neutron excess and high $Q_{\beta}$ values, delayed neutron emission remains an important decay mode and can be utilized as a powerful spectroscopic tool. Experimental results were compared with shell-model calculations using the FSU and $V_{MU}$ effective interactions.</description>

      <title>Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory</title>

Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced production of the exotic charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ off nuclear targets and its internal structure</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility to study the famous charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ production off nuclear targets and its properties in inclusive photon-induced reactions near the kinematic threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for its charged components $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production in direct photon-nucleon interactions as well as three different popular scenarios for their internal structures: compact tetraquarks, molecules of the two open-charm mesons and mixtures of both of them. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at initial photon energies of 9.0-17.5 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections and their ratios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$-10$^{\circ}$ and at photon energy of 14 GeV as well as the A-dependences of the ratios of the total cross sections for $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production at photon energy of 14 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures which are by far the best known. Hence, they might be useful for the determination of these structures -- the issue which has attracted much attention in the hadron physics community -- from the comparison of them with the experimental data from the future high-precision experiments at the CEBAF facility.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\eta'(958)$ nuclear states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely.</description>

      <title>Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent single-electron emission ("hot spots") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.</description>
