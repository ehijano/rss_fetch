      <title>Speakers Unembedded: Embedding-free Approach to Long-form Neural Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end neural diarization (EEND) models offer significant improvements over traditional embedding-based Speaker Diarization (SD) approaches but falls short on generalizing to long-form audio with large number of speakers. EEND-vector-clustering method mitigates this by combining local EEND with global clustering of speaker embeddings from local windows, but this requires an additional speaker embedding framework alongside the EEND module. In this paper, we propose a novel framework applying EEND both locally and globally for long-form audio without separate speaker embeddings. This approach achieves significant relative DER reduction of 13% and 10% over the conventional 1-pass EEND on Callhome American English and RT03-CTS datasets respectively and marginal improvements over EEND-vector-clustering without the need for additional speaker embeddings. Furthermore, we discuss the computational complexity of our proposed framework and explore strategies for reducing processing times.</description>

      <title>WavRx: a Disease-Agnostic, Generalizable, and Privacy-Preserving Speech Health Diagnostic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech is known to carry health-related attributes, which has emerged as a novel venue for remote and long-term health monitoring. However, existing models are usually tailored for a specific type of disease, and have been shown to lack generalizability across datasets. Furthermore, concerns have been raised recently towards the leakage of speaker identity from health embeddings. To mitigate these limitations, we propose WavRx, a speech health diagnostics model that captures the respiration and articulation related dynamics from a universal speech representation. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments on six pathological speech datasets demonstrate WavRx as a new state-of-the-art health diagnostic model. Furthermore, we show that the amount of speaker identity entailed in the WavRx health embeddings is significantly reduced without extra guidance during training. An in-depth analysis of the model was performed, thus providing physiological interpretation of its improved generalizability and privacy-preserving ability.</description>

      <title>DeSTA: Enhancing Speech Language Models through Descriptive Speech-Text Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent speech language models (SLMs) typically incorporate pre-trained speech models to extend the capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose a Descriptive Speech-Text Alignment approach that leverages speech captioning to bridge the gap between speech and text modalities, enabling SLMs to interpret and generate comprehensive natural language descriptions, thereby facilitating the capability to understand both linguistic and non-linguistic features in speech. Enhanced with the proposed approach, our model demonstrates superior performance on the Dynamic-SUPERB benchmark, particularly in generalizing to unseen tasks. Moreover, we discover that the aligned model exhibits a zero-shot instruction-following capability without explicit speech instruction tuning. These findings highlight the potential to reshape instruction-following SLMs by incorporating rich, descriptive speech captions.</description>

      <title>Applying LLMs for Rescoring N-best ASR Hypotheses of Casual Conversations: Effects of Domain Adaptation and Context Carry-over</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied for rescoring automatic speech recognition (ASR) hypotheses. However, their ability to rescore ASR hypotheses of casual conversations has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we reveal it by performing N-best ASR hypotheses rescoring using Llama2 on the CHiME-7 distant ASR (DASR) task. Llama2 is one of the most representative LLMs, and the CHiME-7 DASR task provides datasets of casual conversations between multiple participants. We investigate the effects of domain adaptation of the LLM and context carry-over when performing N-best rescoring. Experimental results show that, even without domain adaptation, Llama2 outperforms a standard-size domain-adapted Transformer-LM, especially when using a long context. Domain adaptation shortens the context length needed with Llama2 to achieve its best performance, i.e., it reduces the computational cost of Llama2.</description>

      <title>DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressive Text-to-Speech (TTS) using reference speech has been studied extensively to synthesize natural speech, but there are limitations to obtaining well-represented styles and improving model generalization ability. In this study, we present Diffusion-based EXpressive TTS (DEX-TTS), an acoustic model designed for reference-based speech synthesis with enhanced style representations. Based on a general diffusion TTS framework, DEX-TTS includes encoders and adapters to handle styles extracted from reference speech. Key innovations contain the differentiation of styles into time-invariant and time-variant categories for effective style extraction, as well as the design of encoders and adapters with high generalization ability. In addition, we introduce overlapping patchify and convolution-frequency patch embedding strategies to improve DiT-based diffusion networks for TTS. DEX-TTS yields outstanding performance in terms of objective and subjective evaluation in English multi-speaker and emotional multi-speaker datasets, without relying on pre-training strategies. Lastly, the comparison results for the general TTS on a single-speaker dataset verify the effectiveness of our enhanced diffusion backbone. Demos are available here.</description>

      <title>Tradition or Innovation: A Comparison of Modern ASR Methods for Forced Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forced alignment (FA) plays a key role in speech research through the automatic time alignment of speech signals with corresponding text transcriptions. Despite the move towards end-to-end architectures for speech technology, FA is still dominantly achieved through a classic GMM-HMM acoustic model. This work directly compares alignment performance from leading automatic speech recognition (ASR) methods, WhisperX and Massively Multilingual Speech Recognition (MMS), against a Kaldi-based GMM-HMM system, the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA). Performance was assessed on the manually aligned TIMIT and Buckeye datasets, with comparisons conducted only on words correctly recognized by WhisperX and MMS. The MFA outperformed both WhisperX and MMS, revealing a shortcoming of modern ASR systems. These findings highlight the need for advancements in forced alignment and emphasize the importance of integrating traditional expertise with modern innovation to foster progress. Index Terms: forced alignment, phoneme alignment, word alignment</description>

      <title>Towards Deep Active Learning in Avian Bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) in avian bioacoustics enables cost-effective and extensive data collection with minimal disruption to natural habitats. Despite advancements in computational avian bioacoustics, deep learning models continue to encounter challenges in adapting to diverse environments in practical PAM scenarios. This is primarily due to the scarcity of annotations, which requires labor-intensive efforts from human experts. Active learning (AL) reduces annotation cost and speed ups adaption to diverse scenarios by querying the most informative instances for labeling. This paper outlines a deep AL approach, introduces key challenges, and conducts a small-scale pilot study.</description>

      <title>Automatic Prediction of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Progression using Longitudinal Speech Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic prediction of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease progression provides a more efficient and objective alternative than manual approaches. We propose ALS longitudinal speech transformer (ALST), a neural network-based automatic predictor of ALS disease progression from longitudinal speech recordings of ALS patients. By taking advantage of high-quality pretrained speech features and longitudinal information in the recordings, our best model achieves 91.0\% AUC, improving upon the previous best model by 5.6\% relative on the ALS TDI dataset. Careful analysis reveals that ALST is capable of fine-grained and interpretable predictions of ALS progression, especially for distinguishing between rarer and more severe cases. Code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Stem-Agnostic Single-Decoder System for Music Source Separation Beyond Four Stems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant recent progress across multiple subtasks of audio source separation, few music source separation systems support separation beyond the four-stem vocals, drums, bass, and other (VDBO) setup. Of the very few current systems that support source separation beyond this setup, most continue to rely on an inflexible decoder setup that can only support a fixed pre-defined set of stems. Increasing stem support in these inflexible systems correspondingly requires increasing computational complexity, rendering extensions of these systems computationally infeasible for long-tail instruments. In this work, we propose Banquet, a system that allows source separation of multiple stems using just one decoder. A bandsplit source separation model is extended to work in a query-based setup in tandem with a music instrument recognition PaSST model. On the MoisesDB dataset, Banquet, at only 24.9 M trainable parameters, approached the performance level of the significantly more complex 6-stem Hybrid Transformer Demucs on VDBO stems and outperformed it on guitar and piano. The query-based setup allows for the separation of narrow instrument classes such as clean acoustic guitars, and can be successfully applied to the extraction of less common stems such as reeds and organs. Implementation is available at https://github.com/kwatcharasupat/query-bandit.</description>

      <title>Streaming Decoder-Only Automatic Speech Recognition with Discrete Speech Units: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified speech-text models like SpeechGPT, VioLA, and AudioPaLM have shown impressive performance across various speech-related tasks, especially in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). These models typically adopt a unified method to model discrete speech and text tokens, followed by training a decoder-only transformer. However, they are all designed for non-streaming ASR tasks, where the entire speech utterance is needed during decoding. Hence, we introduce a decoder-only model exclusively designed for streaming recognition, incorporating a dedicated boundary token to facilitate streaming recognition and employing causal attention masking during the training phase. Furthermore, we introduce right-chunk attention and various data augmentation techniques to improve the model's contextual modeling abilities. While achieving streaming speech recognition, experiments on the AISHELL-1 and -2 datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our streaming approach with non-streaming decoder-only counterparts.</description>

      <title>Factor-Conditioned Speaking-Style Captioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel speaking-style captioning method that generates diverse descriptions while accurately predicting speaking-style information. Conventional learning criteria directly use original captions that contain not only speaking-style factor terms but also syntax words, which disturbs learning speaking-style information. To solve this problem, we introduce factor-conditioned captioning (FCC), which first outputs a phrase representing speaking-style factors (e.g., gender, pitch, etc.), and then generates a caption to ensure the model explicitly learns speaking-style factors. We also propose greedy-then-sampling (GtS) decoding, which first predicts speaking-style factors deterministically to guarantee semantic accuracy, and then generates a caption based on factor-conditioned sampling to ensure diversity. Experiments show that FCC outperforms the original caption-based training, and with GtS, it generates more diverse captions while keeping style prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced ASR Robustness to Packet Loss with a Front-End Adaptation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of automatic speech recognition (ASR), robustness in noisy environments remains a significant challenge. Recent ASR models, such as Whisper, have shown promise, but their efficacy in noisy conditions can be further enhanced. This study is focused on recovering from packet loss to improve the word error rate (WER) of ASR models. We propose using a front-end adaptation network connected to a frozen ASR model. The adaptation network is trained to modify the corrupted input spectrum by minimizing the criteria of the ASR model in addition to an enhancement loss function. Our experiments demonstrate that the adaptation network, trained on Whisper's criteria, notably reduces word error rates across domains and languages in packet-loss scenarios. This improvement is achieved with minimal affect to Whisper model's foundational performance, underscoring our method's practicality and potential in enhancing ASR models in challenging acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>Application of ASV for Voice Identification after VC and Duration Predictor Improvement in TTS Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most crucial components in the field of biometric security is the automatic speaker verification system, which is based on the speaker's voice. It is possible to utilise ASVs in isolation or in conjunction with other AI models. In the contemporary era, the quality and quantity of neural networks are increasing exponentially. Concurrently, there is a growing number of systems that aim to manipulate data through the use of voice conversion and text-to-speech models. The field of voice biometrics forgery is aided by a number of challenges, including SSTC, ASVSpoof, and SingFake.
  This paper presents a system for automatic speaker verification. The primary objective of our model is the extraction of embeddings from the target speaker's audio in order to obtain information about important characteristics of his voice, such as pitch, energy, and the duration of phonemes. This information is used in our multivoice TTS pipeline, which is currently under development. However, this model was employed within the SSTC challenge to verify users whose voice had undergone voice conversion, where it demonstrated an EER of 20.669.</description>

      <title>Zero-Query Adversarial Attack on Black-box Automatic Speech Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, extensive research has been conducted on the vulnerability of ASR systems, revealing that black-box adversarial example attacks pose significant threats to real-world ASR systems. However, most existing black-box attacks rely on queries to the target ASRs, which is impractical when queries are not permitted. In this paper, we propose ZQ-Attack, a transfer-based adversarial attack on ASR systems in the zero-query black-box setting. Through a comprehensive review and categorization of modern ASR technologies, we first meticulously select surrogate ASRs of diverse types to generate adversarial examples. Following this, ZQ-Attack initializes the adversarial perturbation with a scaled target command audio, rendering it relatively imperceptible while maintaining effectiveness. Subsequently, to achieve high transferability of adversarial perturbations, we propose a sequential ensemble optimization algorithm, which iteratively optimizes the adversarial perturbation on each surrogate model, leveraging collaborative information from other models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ZQ-Attack. In the over-the-line setting, ZQ-Attack achieves a 100% success rate of attack (SRoA) with an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 21.91dB on 4 online speech recognition services, and attains an average SRoA of 100% and SNR of 19.67dB on 16 open-source ASRs. For commercial intelligent voice control devices, ZQ-Attack also achieves a 100% SRoA with an average SNR of 15.77dB in the over-the-air setting.</description>

      <title>Subtractive Training for Music Stem Insertion using Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Subtractive Training, a simple and novel method for synthesizing individual musical instrument stems given other instruments as context. This method pairs a dataset of complete music mixes with 1) a variant of the dataset lacking a specific stem, and 2) LLM-generated instructions describing how the missing stem should be reintroduced. We then fine-tune a pretrained text-to-audio diffusion model to generate the missing instrument stem, guided by both the existing stems and the text instruction. Our results demonstrate Subtractive Training's efficacy in creating authentic drum stems that seamlessly blend with the existing tracks. We also show that we can use the text instruction to control the generation of the inserted stem in terms of rhythm, dynamics, and genre, allowing us to modify the style of a single instrument in a full song while keeping the remaining instruments the same. Lastly, we extend this technique to MIDI formats, successfully generating compatible bass, drum, and guitar parts for incomplete arrangements.</description>

      <title>Taming Data and Transformers for Audio Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating ambient sounds and effects is a challenging problem due to data scarcity and often insufficient caption quality, making it difficult to employ large-scale generative models for the task. In this work, we tackle the problem by introducing two new models. First, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality and efficient automatic audio captioning model. We show that by leveraging metadata available with the audio modality, we can substantially improve the quality of captions. AutoCap reaches CIDEr score of 83.2, marking a 3.2% improvement from the best available captioning model at four times faster inference speed. We then use AutoCap to caption clips from existing datasets, obtaining 761,000 audio clips with high-quality captions, forming the largest available audio-text dataset. Second, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters and train with our new dataset. When compared to state-of-the-art audio generators, GenAu obtains significant improvements of 15.7% in FAD score, 22.7% in IS, and 13.5% in CLAP score, indicating significantly improved quality of generated audio compared to previous works. This shows that the quality of data is often as important as its quantity. Besides, since AutoCap is fully automatic, new audio samples can be added to the training dataset, unlocking the training of even larger generative models for audio synthesis.</description>

      <title>Self-Distillation Prototypes Network: Learning Robust Speaker Representations without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training speaker-discriminative and robust speaker verification systems without explicit speaker labels remains a persisting challenge. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised speaker verification approach, Self-Distillation Prototypes Network (SDPN), which effectively facilitates self-supervised speaker representation learning. SDPN assigns the representation of the augmented views of an utterance to the same prototypes as the representation of the original view, thereby enabling effective knowledge transfer between the views. Originally, due to the lack of negative pairs in the SDPN training process, the network tends to align positive pairs very closely in the embedding space, a phenomenon known as model collapse. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a diversity regularization term to embeddings in SDPN. Comprehensive experiments on the VoxCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of SDPN in self-supervised speaker verification. SDPN sets a new state-of-the-art on the VoxCeleb1 speaker verification evaluation benchmark, achieving Equal Error Rate 1.80%, 1.99%, and 3.62% for trial VoxCeleb1-O, VoxCeleb1-E and VoxCeleb1-H respectively, without using any speaker labels in training. Ablation studies show that both proposed learnable prototypes in self-distillation network and diversity regularization contribute to the verification performance.</description>

      <title>1000 African Voices: Advancing inclusive multi-speaker multi-accent speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech synthesis have enabled many useful applications like audio directions in Google Maps, screen readers, and automated content generation on platforms like TikTok. However, these systems are mostly dominated by voices sourced from data-rich geographies with personas representative of their source data. Although 3000 of the world's languages are domiciled in Africa, African voices and personas are under-represented in these systems. As speech synthesis becomes increasingly democratized, it is desirable to increase the representation of African English accents. We present Afro-TTS, the first pan-African accented English speech synthesis system able to generate speech in 86 African accents, with 1000 personas representing the rich phonological diversity across the continent for downstream application in Education, Public Health, and Automated Content Creation. Speaker interpolation retains naturalness and accentedness, enabling the creation of new voices.</description>

      <title>MuTox: Universal MUltilingual Audio-based TOXicity Dataset and Zero-shot Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research in toxicity detection in natural language processing for the speech modality (audio-based) is quite limited, particularly for languages other than English. To address these limitations and lay the groundwork for truly multilingual audio-based toxicity detection, we introduce MuTox, the first highly multilingual audio-based dataset with toxicity labels. The dataset comprises 20,000 audio utterances for English and Spanish, and 4,000 for the other 19 languages. To demonstrate the quality of this dataset, we trained the MuTox audio-based toxicity classifier, which enables zero-shot toxicity detection across a wide range of languages. This classifier outperforms existing text-based trainable classifiers by more than 1% AUC, while expanding the language coverage more than tenfold. When compared to a wordlist-based classifier that covers a similar number of languages, MuTox improves precision and recall by approximately 2.5 times. This significant improvement underscores the potential of MuTox in advancing the field of audio-based toxicity detection.</description>

      <title>Daisy-TTS: Simulating Wider Spectrum of Emotions via Prosody Embedding Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We often verbally express emotions in a multifaceted manner, they may vary in their intensities and may be expressed not just as a single but as a mixture of emotions. This wide spectrum of emotions is well-studied in the structural model of emotions, which represents variety of emotions as derivative products of primary emotions with varying degrees of intensity. In this paper, we propose an emotional text-to-speech design to simulate a wider spectrum of emotions grounded on the structural model. Our proposed design, Daisy-TTS, incorporates a prosody encoder to learn emotionally-separable prosody embedding as a proxy for emotion. This emotion representation allows the model to simulate: (1) Primary emotions, as learned from the training samples, (2) Secondary emotions, as a mixture of primary emotions, (3) Intensity-level, by scaling the emotion embedding, and (4) Emotions polarity, by negating the emotion embedding. Through a series of perceptual evaluations, Daisy-TTS demonstrated overall higher emotional speech naturalness and emotion perceiveability compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>mHuBERT-147: A Compact Multilingual HuBERT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present mHuBERT-147, the first general-purpose massively multilingual HuBERT speech representation model trained on 90K hours of clean, open-license data. To scale up the multi-iteration HuBERT approach, we use faiss-based clustering, achieving 5.2x faster label assignment than the original method. We also apply a new multilingual batching up-sampling strategy, leveraging both language and dataset diversity. After 3 training iterations, our compact 95M parameter mHuBERT-147 outperforms larger models trained on substantially more data. We rank second and first on the ML-SUPERB 10min and 1h leaderboards, with SOTA scores for 3 tasks. Across ASR/LID tasks, our model consistently surpasses XLS-R (300M params; 436K hours) and demonstrates strong competitiveness against the much larger MMS (1B params; 491K hours). Our findings indicate that mHuBERT-147 is a promising model for multilingual speech tasks, offering an unprecedented balance between high performance and parameter efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes our system submission to the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2024) for Irish-to-English speech translation. We built end-to-end systems based on Whisper, and employed a number of data augmentation techniques, such as speech back-translation and noise augmentation. We investigate the effect of using synthetic audio data and discuss several methods for enriching signal diversity.</description>
