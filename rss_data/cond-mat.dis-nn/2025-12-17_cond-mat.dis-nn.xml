      <title>Unreasonable effectiveness of unsupervised learning in identifying Majorana topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In unsupervised learning, the training data for deep learning does not come with any labels, thus forcing the algorithm to discover hidden patterns in the data for discerning useful information. This, in principle, could be a powerful tool in identifying topological order since topology does not always manifest in obvious physical ways (e.g., topological superconductivity) for its decisive confirmation. The problem, however, is that unsupervised learning is a difficult challenge, necessitating huge computing resources, which may not always work. In the current work, we combine unsupervised and supervised learning using an autoencoder to establish that unlabeled data in the Majorana splitting in realistic short disordered nanowires may enable not only a distinction between `topological' and `trivial', but also where their crossover happens in the relevant parameter space. This may be a useful tool in identifying topology in Majorana nanowires.</description>

      <title>On the Boroxol Ring Fraction in Melt-Quenched B$_2$O$_3$ Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An atomistic structural model for melt-quenched B$_2$O$_3$ glass has eluded the simulation community so far. The difficulty lies in the abundance of the six-membered boroxol rings - an intermediate-range order motif suggested through Raman and NMR spectroscopy - which is challenging to obtain in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we report the development of a DFT-accurate machine-learned potential for B$_2$O$_3$ and employ quench rates as low as 10$^{9}$ K/s to obtain B$_2$O$_3$ glasses with more than 30% of boron atoms in boroxol rings. Also, we show that the pressure, and consequently the boroxol fraction, in the deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations critically depends on the range of the geometry descriptor used in the embedding neural network, and at least a 9 $\unicode{x212B}$ range is required. The boroxol ring fraction increases with decreasing quench rate. Finally, amorphous B$_2$O$_3$ configurations display a minimum in energy at a boroxol fraction of 75%, intriguingly close to the experimental estimate in B$_2$O$_3$ glass.</description>

      <title>Freeness Reined in by a Single Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free probability provides a framework for describing correlations between non-commuting observables in complex quantum systems whose Hilbert-space states follow maximum-entropy distributions. We examine the robustness of this framework under a minimal deviation from freeness: the coupling of a single ancilla qubit to a Haar-distributed quantum circuit of dimension $D0 \gg 1$. We find that, even in this setting, the correlation functions predicted by free probability theory receive corrections of order $O(1)$. These modifications persist at long times, when the dynamics of the coupled system is already ergodic. We trace their origin to non-uniformly distributed stationary quantum states, which we characterize analytically and confirm numerically.</description>

      <title>From Bose glass to many-body localization in a one-dimensional disordered Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of a one-dimensional disordered Bose gas using bosonization and the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (RG). We discuss two different scenarios, based on distinct truncations of the effective action. In the first scenario, the Bose glass is destabilized at any finite temperature, giving rise to a normal fluid. Nevertheless, one can distinguish a low-temperature glassy regime, where disorder plays an important role on intermediate length and time scales, from a high-temperature regime, where disorder becomes irrelevant. In the second scenario, below a temperature $T_c$, the RG flow exhibits a singularity at a finite value of the RG momentum scale. We propose that this singularity signals a lack of thermalization and the existence of a localized phase for $T&lt;T_c$. We provide a description of this low-temperature localized phase within a droplet picture and highlight a number of possible similarities with characteristics of many-body localized phases, including non-thermal behavior, avalanche instabilities and many-body resonances, the structure of the many-body spectrum, and slow dynamics in the ergodic phase. The normal fluid above $T_c$, and below a crossover temperature $T_g$, exhibits glassy properties on intermediate scales.</description>

      <title>Intelligent matter consisting of active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this book chapter, we review how systems of simple motile agents can be used as a pathway to intelligent systems. It is a well known result from nature that large groups of entities following simple rules, such as swarms of animals, can give rise to much more complex collective behavior in a display of emergence. This begs the question whether we can emulate this behavior in synthetic matter and drive it to a point where the collective behavior reaches the complexity level of intelligent systems. Here, we will use a formalized notion of "intelligent matter" and compare it to recent results in the field of active matter. First, we will explore the approach of emergent computing in which specialized active matter systems are designed to directly solve a given task through emergent behavior. This we will then contrast with the approach of physical reservoir computing powered by the dynamics of active particle systems. In this context, we will also describe a novel reservoir computing scheme for active particles driven ultrasonically or via light refraction.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystals enabled by Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases of matter that break the discrete time-translation symmetry and is characterized by a robust subharmonic response in periodically driven quantum systems. Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $\pi$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Not all Chess960 positions are equally complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze strategic complexity across all 960 Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) starting positions. Stockfish evaluations show a near-universal first-move advantage for White ($\langle E \rangle = +0.30 \pm 0.14$ pawns), indicating that the advantage conferred by moving first is a robust structural feature of the game. To quantify decision difficulty, we introduce an information-based measure $S(n)$ describing the cumulative information required to identify optimal moves over the first $n$ plies. This measure decomposes into contributions from White and Black, $S_W$ and $S_B$, yielding a total opening complexity $S_{\mathrm{tot}} = S_W + S_B$ and a decision asymmetry $A=S_B-S_W$. Across the ensemble, $S_{\mathrm{tot}}$ varies by a factor of three, while $A$ spans from $-2.5$ to $+1.8$ bits, showing that some openings burden White and others Black. The mean $\langle A \rangle = -0.25$ bits indicates a slight tendency for White to face harder opening decisions. Standard chess (position \#518, \texttt{RNBQKBNR}) exhibits above-average asymmetry (91st percentile) but typical overall complexity (47th percentile). The most complex opening is \#226 (\texttt{BNRQKBNR}), whereas \#198 (\texttt{QNBRKBNR})is the most balanced, with both evaluation and asymmetry near zero. These results reveal a highly heterogeneous Chess960 landscape in which small rearrangements of the back-rank pieces can significantly alter strategic depth and competitive fairness. Remarkably, the classical starting position-despite centuries of cultural selection-lies far from the most balanced configuration.</description>

      <title>Coupling Light with Matter for Identifying Dominant Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DOMINO, a light-matter computing platform that exploits the full complex amplitude of coupled condensate networks to solve maximum-weight clique problems and reveal hidden indirect correlations in large graphs. By embedding network structure directly into a gain-controlled polaritonic (or photonic) oscillator array, DOMINO performs analog optimization, directly solving the maximum-weight clique problem via the gain-controlled minimisation, through a physically enforced global-intensity constraint, allowing the system to converge rapidly to dominant subnetworks while simultaneously extracting phase, encoded co- and counter-regulation patterns. This gain-based mechanism unlocks capabilities inaccessible to conventional Ising-type simulators: all degrees of freedom (amplitude and phase) participate in the computation, dramatically expanding the class of problems that can be efficiently encoded. Our approach is inherently ultrafast, energy-efficient, and naturally robust to noise, requiring no digital post-processing. Applied to real gene-gene coexpression data, DOMINO reliably identifies biologically meaningful transcription-regulator modules and exposes latent regulatory relationships. Because the method applies generically to any weighted network, it establishes a scalable physical route to solving high-value graph-analytic tasks across biology, finance, social systems, and engineered networks.</description>

      <title>Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of summary statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.</description>

      <title>The Basins of Attraction of Soft Sphere Packings Are Not Fractal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape picture is a central tool to study many-body systems. In particular, the energy landscapes of glass-forming liquids, jammed packings, constraint satisfaction problems, or neural networks contain a plethora of minima corresponding to competing states. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction of minima originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales, a result that likely extends to a much broader family of problems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism Without Crystal Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Interpolations for a quantum Parisi formula in transverse field mean-field spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum Parisi formula for the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is proven with an elementary mathematical method. First, a self-overlap corrected quantum model of the transverse field SK model is represented in terms of the Hamiltonian with annealed random interactions. The interpolation given by Guerra and Toninelli is extended to the self-overlap corrected quantum model. It is proven that the infinite-volume limit of the free energy density exists in the operator formalism. Next, another interpolation developed by Guerra and Talagrand is applied to obtain a finite step replica-symmetry breaking (RSB) bound on the free energy density in the transverse field SK model. The interpolation enables us to show that the deviation of the RSB solution from the exact solution vanishes in the self-overlap corrected quantum model in a functional representation of the quantum spin operators. Finally, the corrected terms are removed by the Hopf-Lax formula for a nonlinear partial differential equation to show the quantum Parisi formula for the original transverse field SK model. The formula is extended to that for the transverse field mean-field $p$-spin glass model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin $1/2$ particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin-orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Inverse determination of light-matter coupling in disordered systems from transmittance spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum inverse problems in one-dimensional (1D) electronic disordered systems strongly coupled to optical cavities. More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</description>
