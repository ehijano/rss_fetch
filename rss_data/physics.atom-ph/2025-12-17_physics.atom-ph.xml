      <title>Engineering Zeeman-manifold quintets using state-dependent light shifts in neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general method for engineering qudits through individually addressable transitions between Zeeman sublevels, achieved by combining a large linear Zeeman shift with a state-dependent light shift. This approach lifts the degeneracy between adjacent states while simultaneously tuning their energy splittings into the radio-frequency (RF) domain, enabling coherent manipulation within the Zeeman manifold using experimentally accessible drive frequencies. As a concrete realization, we investigate the implementation of an $SU(5)$ \emph{quintet} encoded in the Zeeman sublevels of the long-lived $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ state of neutral $\mathrm{^{88}Sr}$ atoms confined in far-detuned, $\sigma^{-}$-polarized optical tweezers. Using realistic experimental parameters, we numerically demonstrate full control of the \emph{quintet} manifold, including initialization into a specific $SU(5)$ basis state via a multi-photon transfer, coherent state- and site-selective single-qudit rotations driven by RF fields, and fast state-selective optical readout. Our simulations predict state-preparation fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ within $\sim 1~\mu \rm{s}$, single-qudit gate fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ with $\pi$-pulse durations of $\sim 2.5~\mu \rm{s}$, and fast destructive imaging with durations below $10~\mu \rm{s}$. These results establish a broadly applicable framework for high-fidelity control of Zeeman sublevel-encoded qudits and highlight the $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ manifold in strontium as a promising platform for scalable qudit-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Dipolar quantum gases: from 3D to Low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dipolar quantum gases, encompassing atoms and molecules with significant dipole moments, exhibit unique long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions (DDI), distinguishing them from systems dominated by short-range contact interactions. This review explores their behavior across dimensions, focusing on magnetic atoms in quasi-2D in comparison to 3D. In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries. We identify key challenges for future experimental and theoretical work on strongly dipolar 2D systems. The review concludes by highlighting how these unique 2D dipolar systems could advance fundamental research as well as simulate novel physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>From few- to many-body physics: Strongly dipolar molecular Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in molecular cooling have enabled the realization of strongly dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of molecules, and BECs of many different molecular species may become experimentally accessible in the near future. Here, we explore the unique properties of such BECs and the new insights they may offer into dipolar quantum fluids and many-body physics. We explore which parameter regimes can realistically be achieved using currently available experimental techniques, discuss how to implement these techniques, and outline which molecular species are particularly well suited to explore exotic new states of matter. We further determine how state-of-the-art beyond mean-field theories, originally developed for weakly dipolar magnetic gases, can be pushed to their limits and beyond, and what other long-standing questions in the field of dipolar physics may realistically come within reach using molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Microwave control of photonic spin Hall effect in atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photonic Spin Hall Effect (SHE) causes a polarization-dependent transverse shift of light at an interface. There is a significant research interest in controlling and enhancing the photonic SHE. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the microwave field control of the photonic SHE in a closed-loop $\Lambda$-type atomic system. We demonstrate that both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE can be controlled by varying the relative phase $\phi$ between the driving optical fields and the strength of the microwave coupling $\Omega_{\mu}$. At zero probe field detuning ($\Delta_p = 0$) and $\phi=0,\pi$, the photonic SHE magnitude reaches to upper limit equal to the half of the incident beam waist, and remains largely unaffected by the microwave strength $\Omega_{\mu}$, but its angular position shifts linearly with increasing $\Omega_{\mu}$. At intermediate phases, especially at $\phi = \pi/2$, the magnitude of the photonic SHE exponentially decreases with the increase of $\Omega_{\mu}$. Interestingly, we observed microwave-controlled switching of photonic SHE by tuning the relative phase $\phi$ at an optimized value of $\Omega_{\mu}$ and $\Omega_{c}$. In contrast, at $\Delta_p = \pm \Omega_c$, a maximum photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist occurs at $\phi \leq \pi$ and $\Omega_{\mu} \geq \Omega_p$, where both real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility vanish, yielding a unit refractive index. Our results may have potential applications in microwave quantum sensing and quantum optical switches based on the photonic SHE.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Nitrogen-Cooled Ca+ Ion Optical Clock with a Systematic Uncertainty of 4.4E-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical clock based on the 4S_1/2-3D_5/2 transition of the 40Ca+ ion, operated in a liquid nitrogen cryogenic environment,achieving a total systematic uncertainty of 4.4E-19. We employ a refined temperature evaluation scheme to reduce the frequency uncertainty due to blackbody radiation (BBR), and the 3D sideband cooling has been implemented to minimize the second-order Doppler shift. We have precisely determined the average Zeeman coefficient of the 40Ca+ clock transition to be 14.345(40) Hz/mT^2, thereby significantly reducing the quadratic Zeeman shift uncertainty. Moreover, the cryogenic environment enables the lowest reported heating rate due to ambient electric field noise in trapped-ion optical clocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report validation tests of a calcium atomic beam source manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). We quantitatively evaluated the surface quality and elemental composition of the printed part and defined reference parameters for reliable operation in ultra-high vacuum. Safe operating conditions of the atomic oven were derived from simulations and experimental measurements. The ability of the device to deliver an atomic beam to the main experimental region, the electron/ion trap, was verified via atomic fluorescence imaging.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>
