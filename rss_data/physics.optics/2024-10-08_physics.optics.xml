      <title>Scalable construction of hybrid quantum photonic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonic resonators are central to numerous applications, from efficient spin-photon interfaces to laser oscillators and precision sensing. A leading approach consists of photonic crystal (PhC) cavities, which have been realized in a wide range of dielectric materials. However, translating proof-of-concept devices into a functional system entails a number of additional challenges, inspiring new approaches that combine: resonators with wavelength-scale confinement and high quality factors; scalable integration with integrated circuits and photonic circuits; electrical or mechanical cavity tuning; and, in many cases, a need for heterogeneous integration with functional materials such as III-V semiconductors or diamond color centers for spin-photon interfaces. Here we introduce a concept that generates a finely tunable PhC cavity at a select wavelength between two heterogeneous optical materials whose properties satisfy the above requirements. The cavity is formed by stamping a hard-to-process material with simple waveguide geometries on top of an easy-to-process material consisting of dielectric grating mirrors and active tuning capability. We simulate our concept for the particularly challenging design problem of multiplexed quantum repeaters based on arrays of cavity-coupled diamond color centers, achieving theoretically calculated unloaded quality factors of $10^6$, mode volumes as small as $1.2(\lambda/n_{eff})^3$, and maintaining &gt;60 percent total on-chip collection efficiency of fluorescent photons. We further introduce a method of low-power piezoelectric tuning of these hybrid diamond cavities, simulating optical resonance shifts up to ~760 GHz and color center fluorescence tuning of 5 GHz independent of cavity tuning. These results will motivate integrated photonic cavities toward larger scale systems-compatible designs.</description>

      <title>Universal parity and duality asymmetries-based optical force/torque framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the structured incident light interacts with the inherent properties of the manipulated particle and governs the optical force/torque exerted is a cornerstone in the design of optical manipulation techniques, apart from its theoretical significance. Based on the Cartesian multipole expansion theory, we establish a framework for optical force/torque exerted on an arbitrary sized bi-isotropic (chiral) spherical particle immersed in generic monochromatic optical fields. Rigorous expressions are thus derived which explicitly bridges such mechanical effects of light with particle-property-dependent coefficients and "force/torque source" quantities that characterize the incident light structures. Such quantities, totalled only 12, are quadratic in terms of electric and magnetic field vectors, among which are linear and angular momenta, gradient of energy density, spin density, and helicity. They are further organized into four categories based on their parity (P) and duality (D) symmetries and shown to couple with a particle with different P and D symmetries to induce optical force/torque. This classification specifies the symmetry-breaking criteria required to induce optical force/torque, offering a promising roadmap for engineering the optical manipulation.</description>

      <title>The Verifications of No Bright and Dark Fringes In a Standing-wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After Wiener's experiment, it had been widely accepted that only electric-field was the fundamental-factor for optical interference and believed that there were alternating bright and dark fringes in a light standing-wave field which was formed by a pair of parallel light-beams traveling in mutually opposite directions. While being supplied to the bright fringes, the light-energy from the beams must pass across the dark fringes or across the electric-field nodes, so that the electric-field would not keep zero at the nodes. However, it was inconsistent with the characteristic of electric-field nodes at which the electric-field was zero anytime. Therefore, this naturally led to a presumption that there were no bright and dark interference-fringes in a standing-wave field, which was consistent with zero of the electromagnetic energy-flux-density in a standing-wave field. In this paper, it was fully verified from several aspects, including an ideal experiment, comparing a standing-wave with an LC circuit, a group of experiments and theoretical deductions of formulas. An inclination factor was introduced into the previous common formula of two-beams-interference to rectify it back to the original meaning of its initial definition by energy-flux-density rather than electric-field energy-density. Given the angle between the two-beams to be 180 degrees as a validation, it was verified by the corrected formula that the light-intensities of the bright interference-fringes in a standing-wave were equal to zero. i.e., no interference-fringes existed in a standing-wave field.Thus, instead of electric-field energy-density alone from Wiener's conclusions, interference-energy-flux density was the fundamental-factor to form interference-fringes. The magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the electric-field vector on light interacting with substance.</description>

      <title>Flatbands from Bound States in the Continuum for Orbital Angular Momentum Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flatband material is a system characterized by energy bands with zero dispersion, allowing for the compact localization of wavefunctions in real space. This compact localization significantly enhances inter-particle correlations and light-matter interactions, leading to notable advancements such as fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter systems and flat-band lasers in photonics. Previous flatband platforms, including twisted bilayer graphene and artificial kagome/Lieb lattices, typically focused on nondegenerate flatbands, lacking access to the high degeneracy that can facilitate the localization of orbital angular momentum (OAM). Here, we propose a general framework to construct highly degenerate flatbands from bound states in the continuum (BICs)--a concept originating from quantum theory but significantly developed in photonics and acoustics in recent years. The degeneracy of flatbands is determined by the number of BICs within each unit cell in a lattice. We experimentally validate this approach in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) acoustic crystals, demonstrating flatbands with 4-fold and 12-fold degeneracies, respectively. The high degeneracy provides sufficient internal degrees of freedom, enabling the selective excitation of localized OAM at any position in any direction. Our results pave the way for exploring BIC-constructed flatbands and their localization properties.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking In Nonlinear Binary Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when modes of asymmetric profile appear in a symmetric, double-well potential, due to the nonlinearity of the potential exceeding a critical value. In this study, we examine SSB in a periodic potential where the unit cell itself is a symmetric double-well, in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional periodic systems. Using the tight-binding model, we derive the analytical form that predicts the critical power at which SSB occurs for both 1D and 2D systems. The results show that the critical power depends significantly on the quasi-momentum of the Bloch mode, and as the modulus of momentum increases, the SSB threshold decreases rapidly, potentially dropping to zero. These analytical findings are supported by numerical nonlinear eigenmode analysis and direct propagation simulations of Bloch modes.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Photonics For Self-Assembled Sub-10 nm Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scattering in low-loss homogeneous media is fundamentally driven by the spatial dispersion of refractive index. However, structural molecular fluctuations in such media are vanishingly little owing to a rapidly decaying optical near-field. Its delocalization is possible for systems exhibiting a long-range translational order but local disorder, a property named as crystal-liquid duality. This Letter experimentally demonstrates an anomalous increase in the refractive index of self-assembled sub-10 nm gold nanoparticles induced and probed by electronic Raman scattering (ERS). We show that self-assembly delocalizes the optical near-field and results in the ERS intensity redshift.</description>

      <title>Local high chirality near exceptional points based on asymmetric backscattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate local high chirality inside a microcavity near exceptional points (EPs) achieved via asymmetric backscattering by two internal weak scatterers. At EPs, coalescent eigenmodes exhibit position-dependent and symmetric high chirality characteristics for a large azimuthal angle between the two scatterers. However, asymmetric mode field features appear near EPs. Two azimuthal regions in the microcavity classified by the scatterers exhibit different wave types and chirality. Such local mode field features are attributed to the symmetries of backscattering in direction and spatial distribution. The connections between the wave types, the symmetry of mode field distribution and different symmetries of backscattering near EPs are also analyzed and discussed. Benefiting from the small size of weak scatterers, such microcavities with a high Q/V near EPs can be used to achieve circularly polarized quantum light sources and explore EP modified quantum optical effects in cavity quantum electrodynamics systems.</description>

      <title>Passivity constraints on the relations between transmission, reflection, and absorption eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the passivity constraints on the relations between transmission, reflection, and absorption eigenvalues in linear time-invariant systems. Using techniques from matrix analysis, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the permissible combinations of these eigenvalues. Our analysis reveals that the set of allowable eigenvalue combinations forms a convex polyhedron in eigenvalue space, characterized by a trace equality and a set of linear inequalities. Surprisingly, we uncover a direct connection between this physical problem and Alfred Horn's inequalities, a fundamental result in matrix theory. We provide explicit examples for systems with varying numbers of input ports, demonstrating the increasing complexity of the constraints as system size grows. We apply our theory to analyze the implications of important phenomena, including open and closed channels, coherent perfect reflection and reflectionless scattering modes, and coherent perfect absorption and coherent zero absorption. Our findings not only offer a complete characterization of passivity constraints on wave transport eigenvalues but also establish an unexpected bridge between fundamental wave physics and advanced matrix theory, opening new avenues for research at their intersection. These results have significant implications for the design and optimization of passive wave devices across a wide range of applications in optics, acoustics, and mesoscopic physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam shaping in nanophotonic systems remains a challenge due to the reliance on complex heuristic optimization procedures. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a novel approach to topological beam shaping using Jackiw-Rebbi states in metasurfaces. By fabricating thin-film dielectric structures with engineered Dirac-mass distributions, we create domain walls that allow precise control over beam profiles. We observe the emergence of Jackiw-Rebbi states and confirm their localized characteristics. Notably, we achieve a flat-top beam profile by carefully tailoring the Dirac mass distribution, highlighting the potential of this method for customized beam shaping. This experimental realization establishes our approach as a new mechanism for beam control, rooted in topological physics, and offers an efficient strategy for nanophotonic design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new NHSTA regulations require Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems to operate at night, to protect pedestrians in the deadliest conditions. We propose thermal imaging as a new sensor to complement the AEB sensor suite, alongside the visible front camera and RADAR. This paper explores the benefits of visible-thermal fusion, proposes a windshield integration for such a system, and evaluates the minimum performance requirements for a thermal camera compliant with the NHSTA standards, based on a field study of pedestrian detection range.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an object-oriented programming (OOP) CUDA-based package for fast and accurate simulation of second-harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency using focused Gaussian beams. The model includes linear as well as two-photon absorption that can ultimately lead to thermal lensing due to self-heating effects. Our approach speeds up calculations by nearly 40x (11x) without (with) temperature profiles with respect to an equivalent implementation using CPU. The package offers a valuable tool for experimental design and study of 3D field propagation in nonlinear three-wave interactions. It is useful for optimization of SHG-based experiments and mitigates undesired thermal effects, enabling improved oven designs and advanced device architectures, leading to stable, efficient high-power SHG.</description>

      <title>Quadratic frequency comb based on phase-modulated cw-driven optical parametric oscillator with intracavity dispersion control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel configuration of bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ optical parametric oscillator (OPO) capable of delivering coherent broadband phase-locked spectrum when driven by a continuous-wave (cw) pump laser. By deploying an electro-optic modulator (EOM) internal to a degenerate cw OPO based on MgO:sPPLT or MgO:PPLN and implementing intracavity dispersion control, we show that output spectra extending over 9 nm (119 nm) with well-defined phase coherence can be generated. Pumping the cw OPO at 532~nm (1550~nm) for degenerate operation in the normal (anomalous) dispersion regime at 1064~nm (3100~nm), and using the coupled-wave equations to simulate the OPO in the presence of intracavity dispersion compensation, we demonstrate that this device offers a new alternative for $\chi^{(2)}$-based frequency comb generation. We also show that in the time domain the output of such a device corresponds to femtosecond quadratic solitons in both dispersion regimes. The described concept is generic, paving the way for the realization of a new class of coherent broadband frequency comb sources in different spectral regions based on $\chi^{(2)}$ OPOs pumped by cw lasers.</description>

      <title>Mean-field equation for phase-modulated optical parametric oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely established techniques for the generation of ultrashort optical pulses rely on passive mode-locking of lasers, with the output pulse duration and emission spectrum determined by the intrinsic lifetime of laser transition in the gain medium. Due to the instantaneous nature of nonlinear gain, optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are capable of generating optical radiation in all time scales from continuous-wave (cw) to ultrashort femtosecond regime, if driven by laser pump sources in the corresponding time domain. In the ultrashort time scale, operation of OPOs conventionally relies on mode-locked pump lasers, with the concomitant disadvantages of large footprint and high cost. At the same time, the lack of gain storage mandates the use of synchronous pumping, resulting in increased complexity. In this paper, we present the concept of phase-modulated OPO driven by cw pump laser. The approach overcomes the traditional drawbacks of ultrafast OPOs, enabling femtosecond pulse generation without the need for synchronous pumping, resulting in a simplified, compact and cost-effective architecture using cw input pump lasers. We derive a mean-field equation for a degenerate $\chi^{(2)}$ OPO driven by a cw laser with intracavity electro-optic modulator (EOM), and also including dispersion compensation. The new equation predicts the formation of stable femtosecond pulses ($&lt;$200~fs), in both normal and anomalous dispersion regimes, with a controllable repetition rate determined by the frequency of the EOM. The remarkable functionality of the proposed scheme paves the way for the development of a new class of widely tunable coherent femtosecond light sources in both bulk and integrated format based on $\chi^{(2)}$ OPOs using cw pump lasers.</description>

In this work, an optical sensor capable of simultaneously measuring the distance and thermal emission of surfaces is presented, based on a simple laser diode probe. The principle of operation integrates triangulation with pyrometry in a single device, utilizing the monitor photodiode embedded within the probe package. By alternating the laser emission, the readout can rapidly switch between dimensional and thermal measurements, resulting in combined data acquisition. The presented method is compact, easy to integrate, and cost-effective. The hybrid sensor is implemented into a laser processing setup, where a metallic target is heated and melted by a high-power laser beam. Its inline operation is demonstrated in real-time for dynamic measurements of melt pool distance and radiance. This innovative approach can find applications in diverse fields, such as remote environmental sensing and closed-loop control systems for stabilizing high-temperature processes, including laser welding and additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Compact Cavity-Enhanced Aerosol Detector using Incoherent Light Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have realized a compact optical particle counter utilizing enhancement of light scattering within a high finesse Fabry-Perot optical cavity. In contrast to laser-based approaches such as cavity ringdown spectroscopy we use the light stream from both superluminescent and light-emitting diodes that have no longitudinal coherence. This eliminates the vibration sensitivity that is typical of laser-based cavity methods. The use of the transmission mode of detection allows us to reduce the cavity mirror separation to below 1 cm, with no obvious limit to miniaturization. Typical light scattering instruments are larger, in part due to their sensitivity to background signals from the light source. Our approach paves the way toward a new generation of compact and portable instruments. A simultaneous comparison of the scattering signals with a commercial particle counter shows that our cavity is also sensitive to ultrafine particles below 300 nm diameter that are typically not recorded in such counters.</description>

      <title>Brillouin-based storage of QPSK signals with fully tunable phase retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic memory is an important building block to delay, route and buffer optical information, for instance in optical interconnects or for recurrent optical signal processing. Photonic-phononic memory based on stimulated Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering (SBS) has been demonstrated as a coherent optical storage approach with broad bandwidth, frequency selectivity and intrinsic nonreciprocity. Here, we experimentally demonstrated the storage of quadrature-phase encoded data at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures. We store and retrieve the 2-bit states $\{00, 01, 10, 11\}$ encoded as optical pulses with the phases $\{0, {\pi}/2 , {\pi}, 3{\pi}/2\}$ - a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal. The 2-bit signals are retrieved from the acoustic domain with a global phase rotation of ${\pi}$, which is inherent in the process due to SBS. We also demonstrate full phase control over the retrieved data based on two different handles: by detuning slightly from the SBS resonance, or by changing the storage time in the memory scheme we can cover the full range $[0, 2{\pi})$. At a cryogenic temperature of 3.9 K, we have increased readout efficiency as well as gained access to longer storage times, which results in a detectable signal at 140 ns. All in all, the work sets the cornerstone for optoacoustic memory schemes with phase-encoded data</description>

      <title>Taming plasmonic nanocavities for subradiant entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent rapid advances in quantum nanoplasmonics offer the potential for accessing quantum phenomena at room temperature. Despite this, entangled states have not yet been realised, and remain an outstanding challenge. In this work, we demonstrate how entanglement emerges in plasmonic nanocavities, which are inherently multi-mode, and demonstrate the conditions necessary for entanglement to persist. We find that, in general, these conditions are broken due to coupling with multiple plasmonic modes of different parity. We address this challenge with a new nanocavity design that supports high selective coupling to a single mode, enabling the robust generation of subradiant entanglement in nanoplasmonics. Our results open exciting prospects for leveraging simple plasmonic setups in ambient conditions for applications in quantum communication, sensing and rapid quantum memories.</description>

      <title>WAVE-UNET: Wavelength based Image Reconstruction method using attention UNET for OCT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to leverage a deep-learning (DL) based reconstruction framework for high quality Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT) images, by incorporating wavelength ({\lambda}) space interferometric fringes. Generally, the SS-OCT captured fringe is linear in wavelength space and if Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is applied to extract depth-resolved spectral information, the resultant images are blurred due to the broadened Point Spread Function (PSF). Thus, the recorded wavelength space fringe is to be scaled to uniform grid in wavenumber (k) space using k-linearization and calibration involving interpolations which may result in loss of information along with increased system complexity. Another challenge in OCT is the speckle noise, inherent in the low coherence interferometry-based systems. Hence, we propose a systematic design methodology WAVE-UNET to reconstruct the high-quality OCT images directly from the {\lambda}-space to reduce the complexity. The novel design paradigm surpasses the linearization procedures and uses DL to enhance the realism and quality of raw {\lambda}-space scans. This framework uses modified UNET having attention gating and residual connections, with IDFT processed {\lambda}-space fringes as the input. The method consistently outperforms the traditional OCT system by generating good-quality B-scans with highly reduced time-complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate optical sensing and micromanipulation requires sensitive measurements of the position, orientation, and dynamics of small particles--and sometimes even large objects--under consideration. The signals acquired in the process, including those needed for the feedback control of these particles and objects, are inevitably contaminated by quantum fluctuations and noise that accompany the physical processes of optical interference and photodetection (or photon counting). This paper explores the origins of signal fluctuation and quantum noise that are inevitably associated with such sensitive measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient characterization of spatial Schmidt modes of multiphoton entangled states produced from high-gain parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently characterize the spatial correlations of entangled states of light is critical for applications of many quantum technologies such as quantum imaging. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient theoretical and experimental characterization of the spatial Schmidt modes and the Schmidt spectrum of bright multiphoton entangled states of light produced from high-gain parametric down-conversion. In contrast to previous studies, we exploit the approximate quasihomogeneity and isotropy of the signal field and dramatically reduce the numerical computations involved in the experimental and theoretical characterization procedures. In our particular case where our experimental data sets consist of 5000 single-shot images of 256*256 pixels each, our method reduced the overall computation time by 2 orders of magnitude. This speed-up would be even more dramatic for larger input sizes. Consequently, we are able to rapidly characterize the Schmidt modes and Schmidt spectrum for a range of pump amplitudes and study their variation with increasing gain. Our results clearly reveal the broadening of the Schmidt modes and narrowing of the Schmidt spectrum for increasing gain with good agreement between theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Frequency Comb Calibrated Laser Heterodyne Radiometry for Precision Radial Velocity Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disk-integrated observations of the Sun provide a unique vantage point to explore stellar activity and its effect on measured radial velocities. Here, we report a new approach for disk-integrated solar spectroscopy and evaluate its capabilities for solar radial velocity measurements. Our approach is based on a near-infrared laser heterodyne radiometer (LHR) combined with an optical frequency comb calibration, and we show that this combination enables precision, disk-integrated solar spectroscopy with high spectral resolution (~800,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (~2,600), and absolute frequency accuracy. We use the comb-calibrated LHR to record spectra of the solar Fe I 1565 nm transition over a six-week period. We show that our measurements reach sub-meter-per-second radial velocity precision over a single day, and we use daily measurements of the absolute line center to assess the long-term stability of the comb-calibrated LHR approach. We use this long-duration dataset to quantify the principal uncertainty sources that impact the measured radial velocities, and we discuss future modifications that can further improve this approach in studies of stellar variability and its impact on radial velocity measurements.</description>

      <title>Transition between cooperative emission regimes in giant perovskite nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between emitters within an ensemble can give rise to cooperative processes that significantly alter the properties of the emitted light. One such process is superfluorescence (SF), where excited electric dipoles spontaneously couple coherently and effectively radiate as one macroscopic emitter. It requires low energetic disorder, high temporal coherence and oscillator strength, and sub-wavelength volumes of material can be sufficient. Conversely, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) originates from an avalanche-like stimulated amplification of initially spontaneously emitted photons and does not necessitate temporally coherent interactions among the emitters, but rather requires spatially long enough light propagation within the material to harvest the optical gain. Cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the very few materials where both ASE (in disordered films) and SF (in ordered assemblies) were observed, however leaving unclear whether and how these regimes could be connected. Here, we demonstrate that temperature and excitation density can drive the transition between both regimes in a thin film of giant CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs. At temperatures below 45 K, excitonic SF was observed, whereas above a transition range between 45 K and 100 K, ASE prevails, but requires increased optical excitation and emitter density. Our results work out the different collective effects present in lead halide perovskites, providing fundamental insights into cooperative phenomena and important guidance for the development of compact and bright (quantum) light sources.</description>

      <title>Formation of Anisotropic Polarons in Antimony Selenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimony Selenide (Sb$_2$Se$_3$) is an attractive candidate of photovoltaics with not yet satisfying efficiency. Beside defects, polaron formation originated from lattice distortion was proposed to account for trapping free carriers, and the subsequent photoexcitation dynamics and optoelectronic properties, but such a mechanism is still lack of structural observations. Here we directly track the pathways of carrier and lattice evolutions after photoexcitation through optical and electron diffraction pump-probe methods, revealing the temporal correlations between dynamics of both degrees of freedom. The observed opposite separation changes of Se2-Sb2 and Sb2-Sb1 atom pairs in a few picoseconds, and the intermediate state induced by local structural distortions lasting several tens of picoseconds, coinciding with the optical phonons population and coupling, and the trapping process of carriers, respectively, together with the analyses of modulation on diffuse scattering by the atomic displacement fields of polaron model, indicate the formation of anisotropic polarons with large size. Our findings provide carrier and structural information for helping the elucidation of polaron scenario in Sb2Se3, and probably in materials with anisotropic structure and soft lattice which are popular in developing novel optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Photocarrier Generation from Optical Absorption for Time-domain Simulation of Optoelectronic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.06702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photocarrier generation rate in optoelectronic materials is often calculated using the Poynting vector in the frequency domain. However, this approach is not accurate in time-domain simulations of photoconductive devices because the instantaneous Poynting vector does not distinguish between power flux densities of optical and low-frequency electromagnetic fields. The latter is generated by photocurrents and is not supposed to contribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. In this work, an optical absorption-based model is proposed to accurately calculate the generation rate in time-domain simulations. The proposed approach considers the material dispersion near the optical frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. The instantaneous optical absorption is calculated from the polarization current density associated with the dispersion model. Then, the optical absorption is used to calculate the generation rate. Numerical examples show that the proposed approach is more accurate than the Poynting vector-based method in calculating the instantaneous optical absorption. The proposed method is further validated against experimental results by modeling a photoconductive device. In the multiphysics simulation, the Poynting vector-based method overestimates the carrier generation rate and even generates divergent carrier densities when the low-frequency fields are strong, while the proposed method produces results that match with experimental measurements well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) -- singularities in the parameter space of non-Hermitian systems where two nearby eigenmodes coalesce -- feature unique properties with applications such as sensitivity enhancement and chiral emission. Existing realizations of EP lasers operate with static populations in the gain medium. By analyzing the full-wave Maxwell--Bloch equations, here we show that in a laser operating sufficiently close to an EP, the nonlinear gain will spontaneously induce a multi-spectral multi-modal instability above a pump threshold, which initiates an oscillating population inversion and generates a frequency comb. The efficiency of comb generation is enhanced by both the spectral degeneracy and the spatial coalescence of modes near an EP. Such an ``EP comb'' has a widely tunable repetition rate, self-starts without external modulators or a continuous-wave pump, and can be realized with an ultra-compact footprint. We develop an exact solution of the Maxwell--Bloch equations with an oscillating inversion, describing all spatiotemporal properties of the EP comb as a limit cycle. We numerically illustrate this phenomenon in a 5-\textmu m-long gain-loss coupled AlGaAs cavity and adjust the EP comb repetition rate from 20 to 27~GHz. This work provides a rigorous spatiotemporal description of the rich laser behaviors that arise from the interplay between the non-Hermiticity, nonlinearity, and dynamics of a gain medium.</description>

Abstract: We propose a time-delayed model for the study of active mode-locking that is valid for large values of the round-trip gain and losses. It allows us to access the typical regimes encountered in semiconductor lasers and to perform an extended bifurcation analysis. Close to the harmonic resonances and to the lasing threshold, we recover the Hermite-Gauss solutions. However, the presence of the linewidth enhancement factor induces complex regimes in which even the fundamental solution becomes unstable. Finally, we discover a global bifurcation scenario in which a single pulse can jump, over a slow time scale, between the different minima of the modulation potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric phase in optics (GPIO) is directly associated with the polarization of light. We investigate the physical principles underlying the occurrence of the GPIO for a single-mode light beam propagating in a single-mode optical fiber wound into a circular helix configuration, with and without stress-induced birefringence. The effects of the curvature and torsion of the helical fiber on the rotation of the polarization vector and the associated GPIO are discussed. Analytic expressions are derived for the polarization vector and Stokes parameters for any initial polarization state of the light entering the helical fiber, as well as for the GPIO of the light as a function of helix arc-length. Additionally, the intensity of a superposition of the initial and final beams, which depends on the final GPIO, is derived. Furthermore, the relationship between the GPIO and the solid angle subtended by the tangent vector of the helix plotted on the Poincar\'{e} sphere is analyzed, and the effects of fluctuations of the parameters specifying the geometry and the material characteristics of the helical fiber on the GPIO are considered.</description>

Abstract: Monolayer WSe$_2$ (ML WSe$_2$) exhibits a high second-harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency under single 1-photon (1-p) or 2-photon (2-p) resonant excitation conditions due to enhanced second-order susceptibility compared with off-resonance excitation states \cite{lin2021narrow,wang2015giant}. Here, we propose a novel strain engineering approach to dramatically boost the in-plane second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi_{yyy}$ ) of ML WSe$_2$ by tuning the biaxial strain to shift two K-valley excitons (the A-exciton and a high-lying exciton (HX)) into double resonance. We first identify the A-exciton and HX from the 2D Mott-Wannier model for pristine ML WSe$_2$ and calculate the $\chi_{yyy}$ under either 1-p or 2-p resonance excitations, and observe a $\sim$ 39-fold $\chi_{yyy}$ enhancement arising from the 2-p HX resonance state compared with the A-exciton case. By applying a small uniform biaxial strain (0.16\%), we observe an exciton double resonance state ($E_{\rm{HX}}$ = 2$E_{\rm{A}}$, $E_{\rm{HX}}$ and $E_{\rm{A}}$ are the exciton absorption energies), which yields up to an additional 52-fold enhancement in $\chi_{yyy}$ compared to the 2-p HX resonance state, indicating an overall $\sim$ 2000-fold enhancement compared to the single 2-p A-exciton resonance state reported in Ref \cite{wang2015giant}. Further exploration of the strain-engineered exciton states (with biaxial strain around 0.16\%) reveals that double resonance also occurs at other wavevectors near the K valley, leading to other enhancement states in $\chi_{yyy}$, confirming that strain engineering is an effective approach for enhancing $\chi_{yyy}$. Our findings suggest new avenues for strain engineering the optical properties of 2D materials for novel nonlinear optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Moire exciton polaritons in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature</title>

Abstract: Moire lattices attract intensive attention in the double graphene/TMD layers and photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics within these structures. However, precise measurement of the moir'e ground states, excited states and Bloch bands in the twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report the strong coupling between the excitons of CsPbBr3 microplates and the photonic modes of the moire lattice at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states trapped in the potential sites and moire polariton bands across the twisted photonic lattice. In addition, the phase locking of moire zero (stable in-phase) states and moire pi (metastable antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. Moir'e polariton distribution can be tuned in the shape of parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another one fixed. Our work lays the foundation to study moir'e exciton polariton Wigner crystals and Luttinger liquid in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Microscopic Origins in Nonlinear Optical Crystals: Based on Rigorous Atomic Space Tessellating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clarifying the contribution of various atoms and structural units formed in nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal materials to macroscopic optical response is crucial for NLO crystal design. In this work, the rigorous atomic space tessellating (AST) method without any empirical parameters is introduced to evaluate the correlated contributions in wavelength dependent optical responses. The NLO crystal CsSbF2SO4 with significant asymmetric electron distribution of Sb3+ was selected as the case study. This study indicates that there are significant differences in atomic and dipole moment contributions between static and dynamic second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility. Using only the information obtained from NLO-active unit analysis of static SHG susceptibilities to explain the NLO phenomenon in actual photoexcitation can even lead to qualitative errors. Among all the transitions in SHG effects, the on-site transition of Sb has the largest component, while the O-Sb off-site transition with multiple transition channels contributes the most to the macroscopic SHG susceptibilities. The relevant methods have also been extended to linear optics and used to study first-order susceptibilities anisotropy, which is important for achieving phase matching. Sb3+ contributes significantly to the linear optical anisotropy with the same sign as SO42-.</description>

      <title>Sub-100 Hz Intrinsic Linewidth 852 nm Silicon Nitride External Cavity Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an external cavity laser with intrinsic linewidth below 100 Hz around an operating wavelength of 852 nm, selected for its relevance to laser cooling and manipulation of cesium atoms. This system achieves a maximum CW output power of 24 mW, wavelength tunability over 15 nm, and a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 dB. This performance level is facilitated by careful design of a low-loss integrated silicon nitride photonic circuit serving as the external cavity combined with commercially available semiconductor gain chips. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of compact integrated lasers with sub-kHz linewidth centering on the needs of emerging sensor concepts based on ultracold atoms and can be further extended to shorter wavelengths via selection of suitable semiconductor gain media.</description>

      <title>Isotropic atomic layer etching of MgO-doped lithium niobate using sequential exposures of H$_2$ and SF$_6$ plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a ferroelectric crystal of interest for integrated photonics owing to its large second-order optical nonlinearity and the ability to impart periodic poling via an external electric field. However, on-chip device performance based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by propagation losses arising from surface roughness and corrugations. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially smooth these features and thereby increase photonic performance, but no ALE process has been reported for LN. Here, we report an isotropic ALE process for $x$-cut MgO-doped LN using sequential exposures of H$_2$ and SF$_6$/Ar plasmas. We observe an etch rate of $1.59 \pm 0.02$ nm/cycle with a synergy of $96.9$%. We also demonstrate ALE can be achieved with SF$_6$/O$_2$ or Cl$_2$/BCl$_3$ plasma exposures in place of the SF$_6$/Ar plasma step with synergies of $99.5$% and $91.5$% respectively. The process is found to decrease the sidewall surface roughness of TFLN waveguides etched by physical Ar$^+$ milling by 30% without additional wet processing. Our ALE process could be used to smooth sidewall surfaces of TFLN waveguides as a post-processing treatment, thereby increasing the performance of TFLN nanophotonic devices and enabling new integrated photonic device capabilities.</description>

      <title>Long time behaviour of the solution of Maxwell's equations in dissipative generalized Lorentz materials (II) A modal approach</title>

Abstract: This work concerns the analysis of electromagnetic dispersive media modelled by generalized Lorentz models. More precisely, this paper is the second of two articles dedicated to the long time behaviour of solutions of Maxwell's equations in dissipative Lorentz media, via the long time decay rate of the electromagnetic energy for the corresponding Cauchy problem. In opposition to the frequency dependent Lyapunov functions approach used in [Cassier, Joly, Rosas Mart\'inez, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 74 (2023), 115], we develop a method based on the spectral analysis of the underlying non-self-adjoint operator of the model. Although more involved, this approach is closer to physics, as it uses the dispersion relation of the model, and has the advantage to provide more precise and more optimal results, leading to distinguish the notion of weak and strong dissipation.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent resonant phenomena in all-dielectric scatterers: inversion of magnetic inductance and electric displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical description and experimental verification of resonant phenomena in electromagnetic fields generated in the near zone of all-dielectric rectangular thin sub wavelength frames, subjected to an incident microwave, is considered. The geometry of considered problems is presented by means of arrangements of these frames in three orthogonal planes, normal respectively to electric component, magnetic component and wave vector of the incident wave. Such trio paves the way to design of 3D all-dielectric multiresonant microwave unit cell. Displacement currents, generated by linearly polarized electromagnetic waves in the system, lead to the formation of magnetic and electric dipoles, each of which possess own resonant frequency. Resonant inversion of magnetic inductance and electric displacement is observed. The sliding incidence of plane wave on the frame is shown to provide the sharp and deep resonance in the components of generated field. The phase shift equal to $\pi$ between the magnetic components of incident and generated wave indicates the formation of negative magnetic response. There observes the angular anisotropy of arising dipoles, manifested in values of resonance frequencies and in the dependence of depths of resonant spectral dips upon the orientation of dipoles, with respect to the direction of propagation of incident wave.</description>

      <title>Windmill droplets. Optically induced rotation of biphase oil-in-water droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of microdroplet manipulation, optical tweezers have been used to form and grow droplets, to transport them, or to measure forces between droplet pairs. However, the exploration of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in optically trapped droplets remains largely uncharted. Here, we report the rotation of biphasic droplets fabricated by co-emulsifying two immiscible liquids (i.e., hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon oils) with a refractive index mismatch in water. When trapped, droplets of a specific geometry rotate around the axis of the laser beam, in what appears to be a dissipative, out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. The rotational frequency, obtained from image analysis is stable and proportional to the beam power. Remarkably, droplets that do not interact with the trapping beam can also be rotated indirectly. This is achieved by positioning the droplets at the center of a circular arrangement of multiple, sequentially activated traps. In this case, the droplet orients towards the location of the active trap by a mechanism yet to be understood. Altogether, our results demonstrate out-from-equilibrium phenomenology in optically trapped biphase droplets, which could inspire the development of devices based on them (e.g., optically induced mixing, etc.). In addition, they may shed light on fundamental principles of optical manipulation of asymmetric particles.</description>
