      <title>Motivic classes of irregular Higgs bundles and irregular connections on a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathcal D$ be an effective divisor on $X$. We calculate motivic classes of various moduli stacks of parabolic vector bundles with irregular connections on $X$ and of irregular parabolic Higgs bundles on $X$ with poles bounded by $\mathcal D$ and with fully or partially fixed formal normal forms. Along the way, we obtain several results about irregular connections and irregular parabolic Higgs bundles. In particular, we give a criterion for the existence of a connection on a higher level parabolic bundle and also develop homological algebra for irregular connections and irregular parabolic Higgs bundles. We also simplify our previous results in the regular case by re-writing the formulas for motivic classes in terms of the HLV generating function.</description>

      <title>Decomposing abelian varieties into simple factors: algorithms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an effective procedure to explicitly find the decomposition of a polarized abelian variety into its simple factors if a period matrix is known. Since finding this datum is not easy, we also provide two methods to compute the period matrix for a polarized abelian variety, depending on the given geometric information about it. These results work particularly well in combination with our previous work on abelian varieties with group actions, since they allow us to fully decompose such varieties by successively decomposing their factor subvarieties, even when these no longer have a group action. We highlight that we do not require to determine the full endomorphism algebra of any of the (sub)varieties involved. We illustrate the power of our algorithms with two byproducts: we find a completely decomposable Jacobian variety of dimension 101, filling this Ekedahl-Serre gap, and we describe a new completely decomposable Jacobian variety of CM type of dimension 11.</description>

      <title>Rational Exceptional Belyi Coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional Belyi covering is a connected Belyi covering uniquely determined by its ramification scheme or the respective dessin d'enfant. We focus on rational exceptional Belyi coverings of compact Riemann surfaces of genus 0. Well known examples are cyclic, dihedral, and Chebyshev coverings. Using Maple, we identified all rational exceptional Belyi coverings up to degree 15. Their Belyi functions were calculated for degrees up to 6 along with some for degree 7. We also found new infinite series.</description>

      <title>Positive Moments Forever: Undecidable and Decidable Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is there an algorithm to determine attributes such as positivity or non-zeroness of linear recurrence sequences? This long-standing question is known as Skolem's problem. In this paper, we study the complexity of an equivalent problem, namely the (generalized) moment membership problem for matrices. We show that this problem is decidable for orthogonal, unitary and real eigenvalue matrices, and undecidable for matrices over certain commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings. Our results imply that the positivity problem for simple unitary linear recurrence sequences is decidable, and is undecidable for linear recurrence sequences over the ring of commutative polynomials. As a byproduct, we prove a free version of Polya's theorem.</description>

      <title>Maximal Brill-Noether loci via degenerations and double covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using limit linear series on chains of curves, we show that closures of certain Brill-Noether loci contain a product of pointed Brill-Noether loci of small codimension. As a result, we obtain new non-containments of Brill-Noether loci, in particular that dimensionally expected non-containments hold for expected maximal Brill-Noether loci. Using these degenerations, we also give a new proof that Brill-Noether loci with expected codimension $-\rho\leq \lceil g/2 \rceil$ have a component of the expected dimension. Additionally, we obtain new non-containments of Brill-Noether loci by considering the locus of the source curves of unramified double covers.</description>

      <title>An algebraic-geometric construction of "lump" solutions of the KP1 equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show how certain everywhere-regular real rational function solutions of the KP1 equation ("multi-lumps") can be constructed via the polynomial analogs of theta functions from singular rational curves with cusps. The method we use can be understood as producing a degeneration of the well-understood soliton solutions from nodal singular curves. Hence it can be seen as a variation on the long-wave limit technique of Ablowitz and Satsuma, as developed by Zhang, Yang, Li, Guo, and Stepanyants. We present an explicit example of a three-lump solution constructed via the polynomial analog of the theta function from a rational curve with two cuspidal singular points, each with semigroup $\langle 2,5\rangle$. (In the theory of curve singularities, these are known as $A_4$ double points.) We conjecture that these ideas will generalize to give similar $M$-lump solutions with $M = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ for $N &gt; 2$ starting from rational curves with two singular points with semigroup $\langle 2,2N+1\rangle$ ($A_{2N}$ double points). Similar solutions have been constructed by other methods previously; our contribution is to show how they arise from the algebraic-geometric setting by considering singular curves with several cusps, as in previous work of Agostini, Celik, and Little.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Ideals and Invariant Hilbert Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetric ideal is an ideal in a polynomial ring which is stable under all permutations of the variables. In this paper we initiate a global study of zero-dimensional symmetric ideals. By this we mean a geometric study of the invariant Hilbert schemes $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ parametrizing symmetric subschemes of $\mathbb{C}^n$ whose coordinate rings, as $S_n$-modules, are isomorphic to a given representation $\rho$. In the case that $\rho = M^\lambda$ is a permutation module corresponding to certain special types of partitions $\lambda$ of $n$, we prove that $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ is irreducible or even smooth. We also prove irreducibility whenever $\dim \rho \leq 2n$ and the invariant Hilbert scheme is non-empty. In this same range, we classify all homogeneous symmetric ideals and decide which of these define singular points of $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. A central tool is the combinatorial theory of higher Specht polynomials.</description>

      <title>Coderived and contraderived categories of locally presentable abelian DG-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08237v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of an abelian DG-category, introduced by the first-named author in arXiv:2110.08237, unites the notions of abelian categories and (curved) DG-modules in a common framework. In this paper we consider coderived and contraderived categories in the sense of Becker. Generalizing some constructions and results from the preceding papers by Becker arXiv:1205.4473 and by the present authors arXiv:2101.10797, we define the contraderived category of a locally presentable abelian DG-category $\mathbf B$ with enough projective objects and the coderived category of a Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$. We construct the related abelian model category structures and show that the resulting exotic derived categories are well-generated. Then we specialize to the case of a locally coherent Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$, and prove that its coderived category is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of finitely presentable objects of $\mathbf A$, thus generalizing a result from the second-named author's preprint arXiv:1412.1615. In particular, the homotopy category of graded-injective left DG-modules over a DG-ring with a left coherent underlying graded ring is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of DG-modules with finitely presentable underlying graded modules. We also describe compact generators of the coderived categories of quasi-coherent matrix factorizations over coherent schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that convex ternary quartic forms are sum-of-squares-convex (sos-convex). This result is in a meaningful sense the ``convex analogue'' a celebrated theorem of Hilbert from 1888, where he proves that nonnegative ternary quartic forms are sums of squares. We show by an appropriate construction that exploiting the structure of the Hessian matrix is crucial in any possible proof of our result.</description>

      <title>Global Chern currents of coherent sheaves and Baum Bott currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide global extensions of previous results about representations of characteristic classes of coherent analytic sheaves and of Baum-Bott residues of holomorphic foliations. We show in the first case that they can be represented by currents with support on the support of the given coherent analytic sheaf, and in the second case, by currents with support on the singular set of the foliation. In previous works, we have constructed such representatives provided global resolutions of the appropriate sheaves existed. In this article, we show that the definition of Chern classes of Green and the associated techniques, which work on arbitrary complex manifolds without any assumption on the existence of global resolutions, may be combined with our previous constructions to yield the desired representatives.
  We also prove a transgression formula for such representatives, which is new even in the case when global resolutions exist. More precisely, the representatives depend on local resolutions of the sheaf, and on choices of metrics and connections on these bundles, i.e., the currents for two different choices differ by a current of the form $dN$, where $N$ is an explicit current, which in the first case above has support on the support of the given coherent analytic sheaf, and in the second case above has support on the singular set of the foliation.</description>

      <title>Singular algebraic curves and infinite symplectic staircases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the infinite staircases which arise in the ellipsoid embedding functions of rigid del Pezzo surfaces can be entirely explained in terms of rational sesquicuspidal symplectic curves. Moreover, we show that these curves can all be realized algebraically, giving various new families of algebraic curves with one cusp singularity. Our main techniques are (i) a generalized Orevkov twist, and (ii) the interplay between algebraic $\Q$-Gorenstein smoothings and symplectic almost toric fibrations. Along the way we develop various methods for constructing singular algebraic (and hence symplectic) curves which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study an integral analogue of animated $\delta$-rings: Animated $\lambda$-rings. We define animated $\lambda$-rings in terms of animated rings equipped with a structure of coherently compatible Frobenius lifts and show that the resulting $\infty$-category is obtained from animating the classical notion of a $\lambda$-ring. Our results build on the theory of animated $\delta$-rings developed by Bhatt and Lurie in the context of prismatic cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.07720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a variant of stable logarithmic maps, which we call punctured logarithmic maps. They allow an extension of logarithmic Gromov-Witten theory in which marked points have a negative order of tangency with boundary divisors.
  As a main application we develop a gluing formalism which reconstructs stable logarithmic maps and their virtual cycles without expansions of the target, with tropical geometry providing the underlying combinatorics.
  Punctured Gromov-Witten invariants also play a pivotal role in the intrinsic construction of mirror partners by the last two authors in arXiv:1909.07649, conjecturally relating to symplectic cohomology, and in the logarithmic gauged linear sigma model in upcoming work of the second author with Felix Janda and Yongbin Ruan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following problem in computer vision from the perspective of algebraic geometry: Using $m$ pinhole cameras we take $m$ pictures of a line in $\mathbb P^3$. This produces $m$ lines in $\mathbb P^2$ and the question is which $m$-tuples of lines can arise that way. We are interested in polynomial equations and therefore study the complex Zariski closure of all such tuples of lines. The resulting algebraic variety is a subvariety of $(\mathbb P^2)^m$ and is called line multiview variety. In this article, we study its ideal. We show that for generic cameras the ideal is generated by $3\times 3$-minors of a specific matrix. We also compute Gr\"obner bases and discuss to what extent our results carry over to the non-generic case.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is threefold. The first is to obtain a simple characterization of relative constructible sheaves when the parameter space is projective. The second is to study the relative Fourier-Mukai for relative constructible sheaves and for relative regular holonomic $\mathcal D$-modules and prove they induce relative equivalences of categories. The third is to introduce and study the notions of relative constructible functions and relative Euler-Poincar\'e index. We prove that the relative Euler-Poincar\'e index provides an isomorphism between the Grothendieck group of the derived category of complexes with bounded relative $\mathbb R$-constructible cohomology and the ring of relative constructible functions.</description>

      <title>Morse theory of Euclidean distance functions and applications to real algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two closed subsets $X, Y$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we construct a version of Morse Theory for $\mathrm{dist}_Y|_X \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$, the restriction to $X$ of the Euclidean distance function from $Y$. We use the notion of critical points of Lipschitz functions introduced by Clarke and apply the more general Morse Theory of continuous selections, as presented by Agrachev, Pallaschke, and Scholtes. In this framework, nondegenerate critical points have two indices: a quadratic index as in classical Morse Theory, and a piecewise linear index that relates to the notion of bottlenecks.
  This framework is flexible enough to simultaneously treat two cases of interest for computational algebraic geometry: the Bottleneck Degree (BND) and the Euclidean Distance Degree (EDD). We provide bounds on the number of critical points of $\mathrm{dist}_Y|_X$ when $X$ and $Y$ are generic real algebraic hypersurfaces and relate these bounds to the BND and EDD. We also prove a duality formula relating the Euler Characteristics of $X$ and $Y$ with the number of critical points of $\mathrm{dist}_Y|_X$ and $\mathrm{dist}_X|_Y$, respectively.
  Moreover, we introduce a technical toolset of independent interest, which guarantees that our Morse Theory can be used in the generic algebraic case.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of a rational surface map $f : X \dashrightarrow X$ are easier to analyse when $f$ is `algebraically stable'. Here we investigate when and how this condition can be achieved by conjugating $f$ with a birational change of coordinates. We show that if this can be done with a birational morphism, then there is a minimal such conjugacy. For birational $f$ we also show that repeatedly lifting $f$ to its graph gives a stable conjugacy. Finally, we give an example in which $f$ can be birationally conjugated to a stable map, but the conjugacy cannot be achieved solely by blowing up.
  La dynamique d'une application rationnelle $f : X \dashrightarrow X$ sur une surface est plus simple \`a analyser lorsque $f$ est `alg\'ebriquement stable'. Dans cet article nous \'etudions comment la stabilit\'e peut \^etre r\'ealis\'ee en conjuguant $f$ par un changement de variable birationnel. Nous montrons que si cela peut \^etre r\'ealis\'ee avec une morphisme birationnelle, il existe une telle conjugaison minimale. Pour $f$ birationnelle, nous montrons aussi que l'on obtient une conjugaison stable par rel\'evement successif au graphe. Nous donnons enfin un exemple dans lequel $f$ peut \^etre conjugu\'ee birationnellement \`a une application stable, mais la conjugu\'ee ne peut pas \^etre obtenue uniquement par \'eclatement.</description>

      <title>The $abcd$ conjecture, uniform boundedness, and dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey Vojta's higher-dimensional generalizations of the $abc$ conjecture and Szpiro's conjecture as well as recent developments that apply them to various problems in arithmetic dynamics. In particular, the "$abcd$ conjecture" implies a dynamical analogue of a conjecture on the uniform boundedness of torsion points and a dynamical analogue of Lang's conjecture on lower bounds for canonical heights.</description>

      <title>The Lafforgue variety and irreducibility of induced representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the Lafforgue variety, an affine scheme equipped with an open dense subscheme parametrizing the simple modules of a non-commutative unital algebra $R$ over any field $k$, provided that the center $Z(R)$ is finitely generated and $R$ is finitely generated as a $Z(R)$-module. Our main technical tool is a generalization of the Hilbert scheme for non-commutative algebras, which may be of independent interest.
  Applying our construction in the case of Hecke algebras of Bernstein components, we derive a characterization for the irreducibility of induced representations in terms of the vanishing of a generalized discriminant on the Bernstein variety. We explicitly compute the discriminant in the case of an Iwahori-Hecke algebra of a split reductive $p$-adic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address two longstanding open problems, one originating in PL topology, another in birational geometry.
  First, we prove the weighted version of Oda's \emph{strong factorization conjecture} (1978), and prove that every two birational toric varieties are related by a common iterated blowup (at rationally smooth points).
  Second, we prove that every two PL homeomorphic polyhedra have a common stellar subdivisions, as conjectured by Alexander in~1930.</description>
