      <title>Modelling and Control of Spatial Behaviours in Multi-Agent Systems with Applications to Biology and Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems (LS-MAS) consist of several autonomous components, interacting in a non-trivial way, so that the emerging behaviour of the ensemble depends on the individual dynamics of the components and their reciprocal interactions. These models can describe a rich variety of natural systems, as well as artificial ones, characterised by unparalleled scalability, robustness, and flexibility. Indeed, a crucial objective is devising efficient strategies to model and control the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS to achieve specific goals. However, the inherent complexity of these systems and the wide spectrum of their emerging behaviours pose significant challenges. The overarching goal of this thesis is, therefore, to advance methods for modelling, analyzing and controlling the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS, with applications to cellular populations and swarm robotics. The thesis begins with an overview of the existing Literature, and is then organized into two distinct parts. In the context of swarm robotics, Part I deals with distributed control algorithms to spatially organize agents on geometric patterns. The contribution is twofold, encompassing both the development of original control algorithms, and providing a novel formal analysis, which allows to guarantee the emergence of specific geometric patterns. In Part II, looking at the spatial behaviours of biological agents, experiments are carried out to study the movement of microorganisms and their response to light stimuli. This allows the derivation and parametrization of mathematical models that capture these behaviours, and pave the way for the development of innovative approaches for the spatial control of microorganisms. The results presented in the thesis were developed by leveraging formal analytical tools, simulations, and experiments, using innovative platforms and original computational frameworks.</description>

      <title>On Functional Observability of Nonlinear Systems and the Design of Functional Observers with Assignable Error Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for designing functional observers for nonlinear systems, with linear error dynamics and assignable poles. Sufficient conditions for functional observability are first derived, leading to functional relationships between the Lie derivatives of the output to be estimated and the ones of the measured output. These are directly used in the proposed design of the functional observer. The functional observer is defined in differential input-output form, satisfying an appropriate invariance condition that emerges from the state-space invariance conditions of the literature. A concept of functional observer index is also proposed, to characterize the lowest feasible order of functional observer with pole assignment. Two chemical reactor applications are used to illustrate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Minibus Service with Semi-on-demand Routes in Grid Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of autonomous minibuses which take on-demand directional routes for pick-up and drop-off in a grid network of wider area with low density, followed by fixed routes in areas with demand. Mathematical formulation for generalized costs demonstrates its benefits, with indicators proposed to select existing bus routes for conversion with the options of zonal express and parallel routes. Simulations on modeled scenarios and case studies with bus routes in Chicago show reductions in both passenger costs and generalized costs over existing fixed-route bus service between suburban areas and CBD.</description>

      <title>A Universal Controller for Grid-Tied Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of "Control-Sync," a novel firmware for universal inverters in microgrids, designed to enhance grid stability and flexibility. As hybrid PV-battery systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a critical need for inverters capable of efficiently transitioning between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) modes. Our firmware introduces dual control paths that allow for seamless transitions without reliance on external control devices, reducing communication overhead and increasing operational reliability. Key features include direct phase-angle detection and frequency restoration capabilities, essential for managing asymmetrical power grids and dynamic load changes. The efficacy of Control-Sync is demonstrated through rigorous testing with grid emulators and multi-phase inverters, confirming its potential to improve microgrid reliability and efficiency. This study offers a scalable solution to enhance inverter adaptability in various grid conditions, fostering a more resilient energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Integrating Cascade Pumped Micro-Hydro Storage: A Sustainable Approach to Energy and Water Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage (CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head heights but limited feasibility for direct pumped storage due to horizontal separations. Integrating smaller, strategically placed intermediate reservoirs maximizes energy capture along the cascading path, making pumped storage viable in geographically constrained locations. The proposed system will enhance energy generation potential and provide additional benefits for water management. Using geographical data and a detailed case study focused on Mountain Lake and surrounding lakes, this paper demonstrates the energy efficiency and viability of cascade-based micro-hydro storage. A practical methodology for implementing CPMHS systems is proposed and validated by case studies. An optimization framework is developed for efficient energy capture in regions with challenging topography.</description>

      <title>Outlier-Robust Linear System Identification Under Heavy-tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories sampled from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic analysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process noise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp contrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing more than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For this setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results, we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics. Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution, a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to achieve desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm and analysis technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory data. Our work takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical learning theory for control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating process.</description>

      <title>A Complex Frequency-Based Control for Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control for Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) based on the Complex Frequency (CF) concept. The controller's objective is to maintain a constant CF of the voltage at the terminals of the IBR by adjusting its current reference. This current is imposed based on the well-known power flow equation, the dynamics of which are calculated through the estimation of the CF of the voltages of the adjacent buses. Performance is evaluated by analyzing local variations in frequency and magnitude of the voltage, as well as the response of the system's Center of Inertia (CoI) frequency, and then compared with conventional frequency droop, PI voltage controllers and virtual inertia. The case study utilizes the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus model of the Irish transmission grid and considers various contingencies and sensitivities such as the impact of limiters, delays, noise, R/X ratio, and EMT dynamics. Results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms the conventional controllers, leading to significant improvements in the overall dynamic response of the system.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-based Resilient Secondary Synchronization Strategy of AC Microgrids Under Exponentially Energy-Unbounded FDI Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents fully distributed Lyapunov-based attack-resilient secondary control strategies for islanded inverter-based AC microgrids, designed to counter a broad spectrum of energy-unbounded False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, including exponential attacks, targeting control input channels. While distributed control improves scalability and reliability, it also increases susceptibility to cyber threats. The proposed strategies, supported by rigorous Lyapunov-based proofs, ensure uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence for frequency regulation, voltage containment, and power sharing, even under severe cyber attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through case studies on a modified IEEE 34-bus system, leveraging simulations and real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments with OPAL-RT.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Observer-Based Fixed-Time Consensus Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Multiagent Systems with Unknown States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for achieving fixed-time tracking consensus control in multiagent systems (MASs). Departing from the reliance on traditional controllers, our innovative controller integrates modified tuning and Lyapunov functions to guarantee stability and convergence. Furthermore, we have implemented an event-triggered strategy aimed at reducing the frequency of updates, alongside an output-feedback observer to manage unmeasured states effectively. To address the challenges posed by unknown functions and algebraic-loop problems, we opted for radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs), chosen for their superior performance. Our methodology successfully mitigates Zeno's behavior and ensures stability within a narrowly defined set. The efficacy of our proposed solution is validated through two illustrative simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Defense Framework for DC Microgrids Against Exponentially Unbounded False Data Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, fully distributed control framework for DC microgrids, enhancing resilience against exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Our framework features a consensus-based secondary control for each converter, effectively addressing these advanced threats. To further safeguard sensitive operational data, a privacy-preserving mechanism is incorporated into the control design, ensuring that critical information remains secure even under adversarial conditions. Rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis confirms the framework's ability to maintain critical DC microgrid operations like voltage regulation and load sharing under EU-FDI threats. The framework's practicality is validated through hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating its enhanced resilience and robust privacy protection against the complex challenges posed by quick variant FDI attacks.</description>

      <title>Relative Pose Observability Analysis Using Dual Quaternions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative pose (position and orientation) estimation is an essential component of many robotics applications. Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.</description>

      <title>Performance-Barrier Event-Triggered PDE Control of Traffic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For stabilizing stop-and-go oscillations in traffic flow by actuating a variable speed limit (VSL) at a downstream boundary of a freeway segment, we introduce event-triggered PDE backstepping designs employing the recent concept of performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC). Our design is for linearized hyperbolic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL commands-more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing regular ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^2$ norm. With comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.</description>

      <title>Smooth Reference Command Generation and Control for Transition Flight of VTOL Aircraft Using Time-Varying Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft pose a challenge in generating reference commands during transition flight. While sparsity between hover and cruise flight modes can be promoted for effective transitions by formulating $\ell_{1}$-norm minimization problems, solving these problems offline pointwise in time can lead to non-smooth reference commands, resulting in abrupt transitions. This study addresses this limitation by proposing a time-varying optimization method that explicitly considers time dependence. By leveraging a prediction-correction interior-point time-varying optimization framework, the proposed method solves an ordinary differential equation to update reference commands continuously over time, enabling smooth reference command generation in real time. Numerical simulations with a two-dimensional Lift+Cruise vehicle validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to generate smooth reference commands online.</description>

      <title>Advances in UAV Avionics Systems Architecture, Classification and Integration: A Comprehensive Review and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avionics systems of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone are the critical electronic components found onboard that regulate, navigate, and control UAV travel while ensuring public safety. Contemporary UAV avionics work together to facilitate success of UAV missions by enabling stable communication, secure identification protocols, novel energy solutions, multi-sensor accurate perception and autonomous navigation, precise path planning, that guarantees collision avoidance, reliable trajectory control, and efficient data transfer within the UAV system. Moreover, special consideration must be given to electronic warfare threats prevention, detection, and mitigation, and the regulatory framework associated with UAV operations. This review presents the role and taxonomy of each UAV avionics system while covering shortcomings and benefits of available alternatives within each system. UAV communication systems, antennas, and location communication tracking are surveyed. Identification systems that respond to air-to-air or air-to-ground interrogating signals are presented. UAV classical and more innovative power sources are discussed. The rapid development of perception systems improves UAV autonomous navigation and control capabilities. The paper reviews common perception systems, navigation techniques, path planning approaches, obstacle avoidance methods, and tracking control. Modern electronic warfare uses advanced techniques and has to be counteracted by equally advanced methods to keep the public safe. Consequently, this work presents a detailed overview of common electronic warfare threats and state-of-the-art countermeasures and defensive aids. UAV safety occurrences are analyzed in the context of national regulatory framework and the certification process. Databus communication and standards for UAVs are reviewed as they enable efficient and fast real-time data transfer.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Data-Driven Consensus Control for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems against DoS and FDI attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing data-driven control methods generally do not address False Data Injection (FDI) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks simultaneously. This letter introduces a distributed data-driven attack-resilient consensus problem under both FDI and DoS attacks and proposes a data-driven consensus control framework, consisting of a group of comprehensive attack-resilient observers. The proposed group of observers is designed to estimate FDI attacks, external disturbances, and lumped disturbances, combined with a DoS attack compensation mechanism. A rigorous stability analysis of the approach is provided to ensure the boundedness of the distributed neighborhood estimation consensus error. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through numerical examples involving both leaderless consensus and leader-follower consensus, demonstrating significantly improved resilient performance compared to existing data-driven control approaches.</description>

      <title>Defense Strategies for Autonomous Multi-agent Systems: Ensuring Safety and Resilience Under Exponentially Unbounded FDI Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: False data injection (FDI) attacks pose a significant threat to autonomous multi-agent systems (MASs). While resilient control strategies address FDI attacks, they typically have strict assumptions on the attack signals and overlook safety constraints, such as collision avoidance. In practical applications, leader agents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a safe region to guide heterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated operations while addressing collision avoidance to prevent financial losses and mission failures. This letter addresses these gaps by introducing and studying the safety-aware and attack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under exponentially unbounded FDI (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel attack-resilient observer layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI attacks on the OL. Then, by solving an optimization problem using the quadratic programming (QP), the safety constraints for collision avoidance are further integrated into the SAAR controller design to prevent collisions among followers. An attack-resilient compensational signal is finally designed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer (CIL). Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the SAAR controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience. This study also pioneers a three-dimensional simulation of the SAAR containment control problem for autonomous MASs, demonstrating its applicability in realistic multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cyber-physical Defense for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems Against Exponentially Unbounded Attacks on Signed Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are subjected to attacks on both cyber and physical spaces. In reality, the attackers could launch exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks, which are more destructive and could lead to the system's collapse or instability. Existing literature generally addresses bounded attack signals and/or bounded-first-order-derivative attack signals, which exposes the CPSs to significant threats. In contrast, this paper proposes a fully-distributed attack-resilient bi-layer defense framework to address the bipartite output containment problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems on signed digraphs, in the presence of EU-FDI attacks on both cyber-physical layer (CPL) and observer layer (OL). First, we design attack-resilient dynamic compensators that utilize data communicated on the OL to estimate the convex combinations of the states and negative states of the leaders. The attack-resilient compensators address the EU-FDI attacks on the OL and guarantee the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) estimation of the leaders' states. Then, by using the compensators' states, fully-distributed attack-resilient controllers are designed on the CPL to further address the EU-FDI attacks on the actuators. Rigorous mathematical proof based on Lyapunov stability analysis is provided, establishing the theoretical soundness of the proposed bi-layer resilient defense framework, by preserving the UUB consensus and stability against EU-FDI attacks on both CPL and OL. Finally, a comparative case study for heterogeneous multi-agent systems validate the enhanced resilience of the proposed defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Stable Optimal Guidance for Spacecraft Close-Proximity Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness in achieving autonomy and optimality for nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamical systems. However, traditional black-box machine learning methods often lack formal stability guarantees, which are critical for safety-sensitive aerospace applications. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework that combines control Lyapunov functions with supervised learning to provide certifiably stable, time- and fuel-optimal guidance for rendezvous maneuvers governed by Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics. The framework is easily extensible to nonlinear control-affine systems. A novel neural candidate Lyapunov function is developed to ensure positive definiteness. Subsequently, a control policy is defined, in which the thrust direction vector minimizes the Lyapunov function's time derivative, and the thrust throttle is determined using minimal required throttle. This approach ensures that all loss terms related to the control Lyapunov function are either naturally satisfied or replaced by the derived control policy. To jointly supervise the Lyapunov function and the control policy, a simple loss function is introduced, leveraging optimal state-control pairs obtained by a polynomial maps based method. Consequently, the trained neural network not only certifies the Lyapunov function but also generates a near-optimal guidance policy, even for the bang-bang fuel-optimal problem. Extensive numerical simulations are presented to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Controlled Smart Charging for Electric Vehicles in Cold Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The battery performance and lifespan of electric vehicles (EVs) degrade significantly in cold climates, requiring a considerable amount of energy to heat up the EV batteries. This paper proposes a novel technology, namely temperature-controlled smart charging, to coordinate the heating/charging power and reduce the total energy use of a solar-powered EV charging station. Instead of fixing the battery temperature setpoints, we analyze the thermal dynamics and inertia of EV batteries, and decide the optimal timing and proper amount of energy allocated for heating. In addition, a temperature-sensitive charging model is formulated with consideration of dynamic charging rates as well as battery health. We further tailor acceleration algorithms for large-scale EV charging, including the reduced-order dual decomposition and vehicle rescheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed temperature-controlled smart charging is superior in capturing the flexibility value of EV batteries and making full use of the rooftop solar energy. The proposed model typically achieves a 12.5--18.4% reduction in the charging cost and a 0.4--6.8% drop in the overhead energy use for heating.</description>

      <title>Automated monitoring of bee colony movement in the hive during winter season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have experimentally modelled the movement of a bee colony in a hive during the winter season and developed a monitoring system that allows tracking the movement of the bee colony and honey consumption. The monitoring system consists of four load cells connected to the RP2040 controller based on the Raspberry Pi Pico board, from which data is transmitted via the MQTT protocol to the Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer via a Wi-Fi network. The processed data from the Raspberry Pi 5 is recorded in a MySQL database. The algorithm for finding the location of the bee colony in the hive works correctly, the trajectory of movement based on the data from the sensors repeats the physical movement in the experiment, which is an imitation of the movement of the bee colony in real conditions. The proposed monitoring system provides continuous observation of the bee colony without adversely affecting its natural activities and can be integrated with various wireless data networks. This is a promising tool for improving the efficiency of beekeeping and maintaining the health of bee colonies.</description>

      <title>Can Human Drivers and Connected Autonomous Vehicles Co-exist in Lane-Free Traffic? A Microscopic Simulation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However, the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs, as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines (PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity by 16%, and a 20% HDVs nearly halves it. The study also develops an adaptive potential (APL) controller that forms APL corridors with modified PLs in the surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of 23.6% over the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately 60% CAVs in LFT is required before significant benefits of LFT start appearing compared to a scenario with all HDVs. These findings open a new research direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Yet Formal Policy Synthesis for Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated synthesis of control policies for stochastic dynamical systems presents significant challenges. A standard approach is to construct a finite-state abstraction of the continuous system, typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, generating abstractions is challenging when (1) the system's dynamics are nonlinear, and/or (2) we do not have complete knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven abstraction technique for nonlinear dynamical systems with additive stochastic noise that addresses both of these issues. As a key step, we use samples of the dynamics to learn the enabled actions and transition probabilities of the abstraction. We represent abstractions as MDPs with intervals of transition probabilities, known as interval MDPs (IMDPs). These abstractions enable the synthesis of control policies for the concrete nonlinear system, with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the probability of satisfying a specified control objective. Through numerical experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in achieving reliable control under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Smoothing traffic flow through automated vehicle control with optimal parameter selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stop-and-go traffic waves are known for reducing the efficiency of transportation systems by increasing traffic oscillations and energy consumption. In this study, we develop an approach to synthesize a class of additive feedback controllers for automated vehicles (AVs) to smooth nonlinear mixed traffic flow, including both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Unlike recent explicit AV controllers that rely on strict assumptions such as time-varying equilibrium traffic speed, our proposed AV controller requires only local traffic information, such as inter-vehicle spacing and relative speed, which are readily available through AV onboard sensors. Essentially, it allows a controlled AV to track a subtler version of the perturbed speed profile resulting from its preceding vehicle, thereby enabling smoother traffic flow. Additionally, we provide a method for selecting the optimal control parameters to achieve traffic-smoothing effects efficiently. These unique features of the developed AV controller ensure much higher implementability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations of two distinct traffic scenarios with varying levels of oscillation. The results show that AVs using the proposed controller are capable of effectively reducing traffic oscillations and lowering vehicle fuel consumption by up to 46.78\% and 2.74\%, respectively, for a platoon of 10 vehicles. The traffic-smoothing effect of the controller is more pronounced at higher penetration rates of AVs. While the performance of the proposed approach is slightly less superior to that of the most recent additive AV controller, it offers greater implementability and provides an efficient method for selecting optimal control parameters.</description>

      <title>DDD-GenDT: Dynamic Data-driven Generative Digital Twin Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach to simulate, predict, and optimize the behavior of physical systems, with applications that span manufacturing, healthcare, climate science, and more. However, the development of DT models often faces challenges such as high data requirements, integration complexity, and limited adaptability to dynamic changes in physical systems. This paper presents a new method inspired by dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS), called the dynamic data-driven generative of digital twins framework (DDD-GenDT), which combines the physical system with LLM, allowing LLM to act as DT to interact with the physical system operating status and generate the corresponding physical behaviors. We apply DDD-GenDT to the computer numerical control (CNC) machining process, and we use the spindle current measurement data in the NASA milling wear data set as an example to enable LLMs to forecast the physical behavior from historical data and interact with current observations. Experimental results show that in the zero-shot prediction setting, the LLM-based DT can adapt to the change in the system, and the average RMSE of the GPT-4 prediction is 0.479A, which is 4.79% of the maximum spindle motor current measurement of 10A, with little training data and instructions required. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of DDD-GenDT in this specific application and their potential to construct digital twins. We also discuss the limitations and challenges that may arise in practical implementations.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in learning-based control have increased interest in stable inversion to meet growing performance demands. Here, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for stable inversion, addressing challenges in non-minimum phase, non-square, and singular systems. An H-Infinity based algebraic approximation is introduced for near-perfect tracking without preview. Additionally, we propose a novel robust control strategy combining the nominal model with dual feedforward control to form a feedback structure. Numerical comparison demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in Network Constrained Markets with Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a networked economic system composed of $n$ producers supplying a single homogeneous good to a number of geographically separated markets and of a centralized authority, called the market maker. Producers compete \`a la Cournot, by choosing the quantities of good to supply to each market they have access to in order to maximize their profit. Every market is characterized by its inverse demand functions returning the unit price of the considered good as a function of the total available quantity. Markets are interconnected by a dispatch network through which quantities of the considered good can flow within finite capacity constraints. Such flows are determined by the market maker, who aims at maximizing a designated welfare function. We model such competition as a strategic game with $n+1$ players: the producers and the market game. For this game, we first establish the existence of Nash equilibria under standard concavity assumptions. We then identify sufficient conditions for the game to be potential with an essentially unique Nash equilibrium. Next, we present a general result that connects the optimal action of the market maker with the capacity constraints imposed on the network. For the commonly used Walrasian welfare, our finding proves a connection between capacity bottlenecks in the market network and the emergence of price differences between markets separated by saturated lines. This phenomenon is frequently observed in real-world scenarios, for instance in power networks. Finally, we validate the model with data from the Italian day-ahead electricity market.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of Self-Organized Aggregation without Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Gauci et al. (2014) studied the fundamental task of aggregation, wherein multiple robots need to gather without an a priori agreed-upon meeting location, using minimal hardware. That paper considered differential-drive robots that are memoryless and unable to compute. Moreover, the robots cannot communicate with one another and are only equipped with a simple sensor that determines whether another robot is directly in front of them. Despite those severe limitations, Gauci et al. introduced a controller and proved mathematically that it aggregates a system of two robots for any initial state. Unfortunately, for larger systems, the same controller aggregates empirically in many cases but not all. Thus, the question of whether a controller exists that aggregates for any number of robots remains open. In this paper, we show that no such controller exists by investigating the geometric structure of controllers. In addition, we disprove the aggregation proof of the paper above for two robots and present an alternative controller alongside a simple and rigorous aggregation proof.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of timely delivery of status update packets in a real-time communication system, where a transmitter sends status updates generated by a source to a receiver over an unreliable channel. The timestamps of transmitted and received packets are measured using separate clocks located at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. To account for possible clock drift between these two clocks, we consider both deterministic and probabilistic drift scenarios. We analyze the system's performance regarding the Age of Information (AoI) and derive closed-form expressions for the distribution and the average AoI under both clock drift models. Additionally, we explore the impact of key system parameters on the average AoI through analytical and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Policies for Generative Modeling of Spacecraft Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.</description>

      <title>Tight Constraint Prediction of Six-Degree-of-Freedom Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx), an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG), generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem, improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx) formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.</description>

      <title>HPC Application Parameter Autotuning on Edge Devices: A Bandit Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing necessity for enhanced processing capabilities in edge devices with limited resources has led us to develop effective methods for improving high-performance computing (HPC) applications. In this paper, we introduce LASP (Lightweight Autotuning of Scientific Application Parameters), a novel strategy designed to address the parameter search space challenge in edge devices. Our strategy employs a multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique focused on online exploration and exploitation. Notably, LASP takes a dynamic approach, adapting seamlessly to changing environments. We tested LASP with four HPC applications: Lulesh, Kripke, Clomp, and Hypre. Its lightweight nature makes it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices. By employing the MAB framework to efficiently navigate the search space, we achieved significant performance improvements while adhering to the stringent computational limits of edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LASP in optimizing parameter search on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Co-Design of a Robot Controller Board and Indoor Positioning System for IoT-Enabled Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the development of a cost-effective yet precise indoor robot navigation system composed of a custom robot controller board and an indoor positioning system. First, the proposed robot controller board has been specially designed for emerging IoT-based robot applications and is capable of driving two 6-Amp motor channels. The controller board also embeds an on-board micro-controller with WIFI connectivity, enabling robot-to-server communications for IoT applications. Then, working together with the robot controller board, the proposed positioning system detects the robot's location using a down-looking webcam and uses the robot's position on the webcam images to estimate the real-world position of the robot in the environment. The positioning system can then send commands via WIFI to the robot in order to steer it to any arbitrary location in the environment. Our experiments show that the proposed system reaches a navigation error smaller or equal to 0.125 meters while being more than two orders of magnitude more cost-effective compared to off-the-shelve motion capture (MOCAP) positioning systems.</description>

      <title>Change Detection-Based Procedures for Piecewise Stationary MABs: A Modular Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other methods in simulations.</description>

      <title>Proximal Policy Optimization-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach for DC-DC Boost Converter Control: A Comparative Evaluation Against Traditional Control Techniques</title>

Abstract: This article proposes a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach for DC-DC boost converter control that is compared with traditional control methods. The performance of the PPO algorithm is evaluated using MATLAB Simulink co-simulation, and the results demonstrate that the most efficient approach for achieving short settling time and stability is to combine the PPO algorithm with a reinforcement learning-based control method. The simulation results show that the control method based on RL with the PPO algorithm pro vides step response characteristics that outperform traditional control approaches, thereby enhancing DC-DC boost converter control. This research also highlights the inherent capability of the reinforcement learning method to enhance the performance of boost converter control.</description>

      <title>A hybrid systems framework for data-based adaptive control of linear time-varying systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the data-driven stabilization of discrete-time linear time-varying systems. The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based event-triggering rule. To do so, we monitor the evolution of a data-based Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not satisfy a designed desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last collected data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally leads to a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the controller and provide general conditions under which various stability notions can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions are satisfied are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electricity Market-Clearing With Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme events jeopardize power network operations, causing beyond-design failures and massive supply interruptions. Existing market designs fail to internalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events. Efficiently maintaining the reliability of renewable-dominant power systems during extreme weather events requires co-optimizing system resources, while differentiating between large/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast conditions. To address this gap in both research and practice, we propose managing the uncertainties associated with extreme weather events through an additional reserve service, termed extreme reserve. The procurement of extreme reserve is co-optimized with energy and regular reserve using a large deviation theory chance-constrained (LDT-CC) model, where LDT offers a mathematical framework to quantify the increased uncertainty during extreme events. To mitigate the high additional costs associated with reserve scheduling under the LDT-CC model, we also propose an LDT model based on weighted chance constraints (LDT-WCC). This model prepares the power system for extreme events at a lower cost, making it a less conservative alternative to the LDT-CC model. The proposed market design leads to a competitive equilibrium while ensuring cost recovery. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified 8-zone ISO New England system highlight the advantages of the proposed market design.</description>

      <title>An Econometric Analysis of Large Flexible Cryptocurrency-mining Consumers in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, power grids have seen a surge in large cryptocurrency mining firms, with individual consumption levels reaching 700MW. This study examines the behavior of these firms in Texas, focusing on how their consumption is influenced by cryptocurrency conversion rates, electricity prices, local weather, and other factors. We transform the skewed electricity consumption data of these firms, perform correlation analysis, and apply a seasonal autoregressive moving average model for analysis. Our findings reveal that, surprisingly, short-term mining electricity consumption is not directly correlated with cryptocurrency conversion rates. Instead, the primary influencers are the temperature and electricity prices. These firms also respond to avoid transmission and distribution network (T&amp;D) charges - commonly referred to as four Coincident peak (4CP) charges - during the summer months. As the scale of these firms is likely to surge in future years, the developed electricity consumption model can be used to generate public, synthetic datasets to understand the overall impact on the power grid. The developed model could also lead to better pricing mechanisms to effectively use the flexibility of these resources towards improving power grid reliability.</description>

      <title>Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upper midband, designated as Frequency Range 3 (FR3), is increasingly critical for the next-generation of wireless networks. Channel propagation measurements and their statistical analysis are essential first steps towards this direction. This paper presents a comprehensive ultra-wideband (UWB) double-directional channel measurement campaign in a large portion of FR3 (6-14 GHz) for urban microcellular environments. We analyze over 25,000 directional power delay profiles and providing key insights into line-of-sight (LoS) and obstructed line-of-sight (OLoS) conditions. This is followed by statistical modeling of path loss, shadowing, delay spread and angular spread. As the first UWB double-directional measurement campaign in this frequency range, this work offers critical insights for spectrum allocation, channel modeling, and the design of advanced communication systems, paving the way for further exploration of FR3.</description>

      <title>Geometric Tracking Control of Omnidirectional Multirotors for Aggressive Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An omnidirectional multirotor has the maneuverability of decoupled translational and rotational motions, superseding the traditional multirotors' motion capability. Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account and does not require additional rotor state measurement. This is achieved by integrating a linear rotor dynamics model into the vehicle's equations of motion and designing a PD controller to compensate for the effects introduced by rotor dynamics. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments, where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.</description>

      <title>Fitted Q-Iteration via Max-Plus-Linear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</description>

      <title>Distributed Thompson sampling under constrained communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian average regret and Bayesian simple regret, where the bound depends on the structure of the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, demonstrating the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.</description>

      <title>Global Tensor Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and high-quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Partially Observed Optimal Stochastic Control: Regularity, Optimality, Approximations, and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review/tutorial article, we present recent progress on optimal control of partially observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We first present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.</description>

      <title>Local Identifiability of Networks with Nonlinear Node Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the identifiability of nonlinear network systems with partial excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and topologies.</description>
