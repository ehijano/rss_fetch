      <title>Equality of morphic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphic sequences form a natural class of infinite sequences, typically defined as the coding of a fixed point of a morphism. Different morphisms and codings may yield the same morphic sequence. This paper investigates how to prove that two such representations of a morphic sequence by morphisms represent the same sequence. In particular, we focus on the smallest representations of the subsequences of the binary Fibonacci sequence obtained by only taking the even or odd elements. The proofs we give are induction proofs of several properties simultaneously, and are typically found fully automatically by a tool that we developed.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Functional Equation Proving: A Benchmark Dataset and A Domain-Specific In-Context Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) faces challenges due to its complexity and computational demands. Recent work has explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) for ATP action selection, but these methods can be resource-intensive. This study introduces FEAS, an agent that enhances the COPRA in-context learning framework within Lean. FEAS refines prompt generation, response parsing, and incorporates domain-specific heuristics for functional equations. It introduces FunEq, a curated dataset of functional equation problems with varying difficulty. FEAS outperforms baselines on FunEq, particularly with the integration of domain-specific heuristics. The results demonstrate FEAS's effectiveness in generating and formalizing high-level proof strategies into Lean proofs, showcasing the potential of tailored approaches for specific ATP challenges.</description>

      <title>Error Detection and Constraint Recovery in Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification without Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC), particularly neurosymbolic-based approaches, have demonstrated improved consistency and accuracy by enforcing constraints on a neural model during training. However, such work assumes the existence of such constraints a-priori. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and present an approach based on Error Detection Rules (EDR) that allow for learning explainable rules about the failure modes of machine learning models. We show that these rules are not only effective in detecting when a machine learning classifier has made an error but also can be leveraged as constraints for HMC, thereby allowing the recovery of explainable constraints even if they are not provided. We show that our approach is effective in detecting machine learning errors and recovering constraints, is noise tolerant, and can function as a source of knowledge for neurosymbolic models on multiple datasets, including a newly introduced military vehicle recognition dataset.</description>

      <title>Algebraic anti-unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstraction is key to human and artificial intelligence as it allows one to see common structure in otherwise distinct objects or situations and as such it is a key element for generality in AI. Anti-unification (or generalization) is \textit{the} part of theoretical computer science and AI studying abstraction. It has been successfully applied to various AI-related problems, most importantly inductive logic programming. Up to this date, anti-unification is studied only from a syntactic perspective in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to initiate an algebraic (i.e. semantic) theory of anti-unification within general algebras. This is motivated by recent applications to similarity and analogical proportions.</description>

      <title>LLM4ED: Large Language Models for Automatic Equation Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equation discovery is aimed at directly extracting physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.</description>
