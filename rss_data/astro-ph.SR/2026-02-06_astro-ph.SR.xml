      <title>Classifying white dwarfs from multi-object spectroscopy surveys with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With tens to hundreds of spectra of white dwarfs being taken each night from multi-object spectroscopic surveys, automated spectral classification is essential as part of efficient data processing. In this study, we design a neural network to classify the spectral type of white dwarfs using a combination of spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release~1 and imaging from Pan-STARRS photometry. The trained network has a near 100% accuracy at identifying DA and DB white dwarf spectral types, while having an 85-95% accuracy for identifying all other primary types, including metal pollution. Distinct spectral or photometric features map into separate structures when performing a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction. Investigating further and looking at multiple epoch spectra, we performed a separate search for objects that have strongly changing spectral signatures using UMAP, discovering 3 new inhomogeneous surface composition ('double-faced') white dwarfs in the process. We lastly show how machine learning has the potential to separate single white dwarfs from double white dwarf binary star systems in a large dataset, ideal for isolating a single star population. The results from all of these techniques show a compelling use of machine learning to boost efficiency in analysing white dwarfs observed in multi-object spectroscopy surveys, at times replacing the need for human-driven spectral classifications. This demonstrates our techniques as powerful tools for batch population analyses, finding outliers as a form of rare subclass detection, and in conducting multi-epoch spectral analyses.</description>

      <title>Complex hydrogen chemical equilibrium and Gaia low mass problem in cool white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Gaia data set shows substantial misfit between models and observation for cool white dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}&lt;6000\,\rm K$, resulting in severe underestimation of masses of these stars.
  We aim to understand the underlying modelling issues.
  State of the art atmosphere models have been applied to analyse the Gaia DR3 sample of white dwarfs as well as quantum mechanical calculations to quantify formation and stability of different hydrogen species in the atmospheres of these stars.
  We reconcile the models and observations when we artificially suppress formation of $\rm H_3^+$ species, a process which substantially alters the chemical equilibrium at $T_{\rm eff}&lt;6000\,\rm K$, resulting in an overabundance of free electrons and $\rm H^-$, and strengthening of $\rm H^-$ bound-free absorption. Removing the $\rm H_3^+$ species from chemical equilibrium consideration makes ionization of hydrogen atoms the main source of free electrons, with the resulting models reproducing well the Gaia white dwarfs cooling branch. Because $\rm H_3^+$ must form under the considered conditions, likely it is the overestimation of its partition function and resulting abundance or the formation of $\rm H_3^-$ or another anionic species that suppresses the formation of $\rm H^-$ as a countercharge for $\rm H_3^+$ in current models.
  Chemical equilibrium in cool, hydrogen atmospheres white dwarfs must be reconsidered in respect to the abundance of $\rm H_3^+$ species and presence of unaccounted charge species.</description>

      <title>Wide sdB binaries. I. Orbital and atmospheric parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period binary systems containing a B-type hot subdwarf (sdB) and a main-sequence companion are thought to originate from binary interactions involving stable mass transfer from the red giant, the progenitor of the sdB, to the MS companion. However, despite the recent progress in modelling their population, some of their observed properties are not entirely understood. Because determining their orbits requires extended campaigns of high-resolution spectroscopic observations, only a limited number of long-period sdB binaries have been studied with completely determined orbital parameters. A sample of 32 wide binary systems containing sdB stars was selected for the analysis of the radial velocity curves of both companions. The dataset consisted of high-resolution spectra obtained with the HERMES and UVES spectrographs. The orbital parameters were derived by simultaneously fitting Keplerian orbits to the radial velocities of the sdB and its companion. The atmospheric parameters of the cool companions were determined using the GSSP code, which analyses the master spectra of the systems with a grid of LTE atmospheric models. An additional sample of wide sdB binaries was built up by cross-matching the Gaia NSS catalogue with catalogues of sdB candidates and spectroscopically confirmed systems reported by Culpan2022A&amp;A catalogues. The outcomes from both samples were compared with existing theoretical models to assess their consistency with current formation and evolutionary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the coronal magnetic field in the 2022-10-02 X-class flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are driven by release of free magnetic energy and often associated with restructurization of the magnetic field topology. Yet, observations of evolving magnetic field in the flaring volume are limited to very few cases including the 2017-09-10 X8.2 limb flare; thus, a verification of whether a similar evolution takes place in other solar flares is needed. Here we report one more, 2022-10-02, X1.1 class solar flare but seen on disk, whose microwave data permit mapping the magnetic field over the flaring source and tracking magnetic field evolution over the course of the flare. We found that the coronal magnetic field shows a prominent decay with the rate up to 10 G s$^{-1}$ in several (above) loop-top locations. The magnetic field is also confidently measured at the loop legs and the bottom part of the erupting filament. Prominent acceleration of electrons is detected where the magnetic field decays. We developed 3D models of the flare, whose magnetic field shows resemblance and also deviation from the magnetic field inferred from the microwave data. This study confirms that the coronal magnetic field decays during the rise phase of the solar flare. The amount of released magnetic energy is sufficient to support other components of the flare energy.</description>

      <title>Detailed TESS-Based Light Curve Modeling and Fundamental Parameter Estimation of 27 W UMa-Type Contact Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a comprehensive analysis of 27 short period contact binary systems for which no light curve analysis had previously been reported. Photometric time-series data from the TESS mission were used in this analysis. The observational results were validated using additional TESS sectors, along with complementary photometric observations from the ASAS-SN survey. The photometric light curves of the 27 contact binary systems were analyzed with the BSN application. Model solutions were obtained through iterative fitting followed by MCMC-based refinement to derive reliable system parameters, and starspot configurations were incorporated for seven targets exhibiting O'Connell effect asymmetries. The absolute parameters of the target systems were derived using the empirical parameter relationship between orbital period and semi-major axis. Based on the results of the light curve solutions and the estimated absolute parameters, five of the analyzed systems are identified as A-subtype, while the remaining targets belong to the W-subtype. We analyzed a sample of 484 W UMa contact binaries to identify the physical and orbital parameters that most effectively distinguish A-subtype from W-subtype systems using t-statistics. Three targets exhibited extremely low mass ratios, and their orbital analysis confirmed that they are dynamically stable. The evolutionary states of the systems were examined, showing that lower-mass companions are generally more evolved, while more massive components remain less evolved. The positions of the systems and their stellar components were compared across four diagrams derived from empirical parameter relationship studies, showing good agreement with the linear fits.</description>

      <title>Rotating strange dwarfs and their indistinguishability from white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of strange dwarfs, modeled as hybrid compact stars composed of a self bound strange quark matter core surrounded by a white dwarf like crust, within a fully relativistic framework. Static configurations are constructed by solving the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations, and uniformly rotating configurations are modeled within the Hartle Thorne slow rotation expansion (to ${\cal O}(\Omega^2)$). We therefore interpret results at large fractional spins conservatively, and use the Kepler frequency mainly as a reference scale for comparing different masses and models. The stellar matter is described using a hybrid equation of state, in which the crust is modeled by a degenerate electron ion system and the core by the MIT Bag Model. By comparing strange dwarfs with conventional white dwarfs across a range of rotation rates, we show that rotation inflates the radius and can reduce (in a quantifiable way) the separation between the two families in the $(M,R)$ plane, potentially masking structural signatures associated with the presence of a quark core. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for rotational effects when interpreting mass radius measurements and other global observables in the context of searches for exotic compact objects in current and future high precision surveys.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cataclysmic variables under different magnetic braking prescriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) - interacting binaries where a low-mass donor transfers matter to a white dwarf via an accretion disk - is critically controlled by magnetic braking (MB). Significant uncertainties persist regarding how distinct MB formalisms influence CV evolutionary pathways.
  Aims. We performed systematic simulations of CV evolution under five MB prescriptions using the MESA code: the classical Skumanich law and the Matt, Reiners &amp; Mohanty (RM12), intermediate, and convection-boosted formalisms. Primary objectives included investigating their impact on orbital period distributions, mass-transfer rates, donor star evolution, and period gap characteristics.
  Methods. Evolutionary sequences were computed across all MB frameworks. We analyzed their effects on key observables: orbital period evolution, accretion rates, and period gap morphology.
  Results. Magnetic braking prescription selection fundamentally determines whether CV systems develop the characteristic period gap. The intermediate prescription provides optimal consistency with observations of nonmagnetic CVs, simultaneously reproducing the gap location and donor properties. Strong braking models (e.g., Skumanich) produce clear detachment phases, while self-consistent regulation models (Matt12 and RM12) maintain weak angular momentum loss and fail to form a gap, making them more prone to magnetic CVs.
  Conclusions. The presence or absence of the period gap is primarily governed by the strength and behavior of MB before the donor becomes fully convective. Future studies must further incorporate the regulatory effects of magnetic fields on donor structure to accurately predict the period distribution characteristics of magnetic CVs.</description>

      <title>First Detailed MeerKAT Imaging Spectroscopy of a Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations provide powerful diagnostics of energy release, particle acceleration, and transport processes in solar flares. However, despite recent progress in radio interferometric imaging spectroscopy, current instruments still face limitations in image fidelity and resolution, restricting detailed spectroscopic studies of flaring regions. Here we present high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy of a M1.3 GOES class flare with MeerKAT, a precursor to the future-generation array SKA-Mid. Radio emissions at the observed frequencies typically originate in the low corona, offering valuable insights into magnetic reconnection and primary energy-release sites. The obtained images achieve an unprecedented dynamic range exceeding 10^3, enabling simultaneous analysis of bright coherent bursts and faint incoherent emission from the active region. Multiple spatially distinct coherent sources are identified, implying contributions from different populations of accelerated electrons. The incoherent emission extends beyond AIA structures, highlighting MeerKAT's ability to detect dilute but hot plasma invisible to Extreme Ultraviolet instruments. Combined with co-temporal Hard X-ray images and magnetic field extrapolations, the radio sources are located within distinct magnetic structures, further revealing their association with different populations of accelerated electrons. These results demonstrate MeerKAT imaging spectroscopy as powerful diagnostics of solar flares and pave the way for future solar flare studies with SKA-Mid.</description>

      <title>Probing Compact Objects in Wide-Orbit Binaries with Joint LAMOST LRS and MRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-orbit binaries serve as crucial laboratories for understanding stellar evolution and identifying quiescent compact objects. In this work, we search for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries by merging the LAMOST multi-epoch catalogs from LRS and MRS in the 12th data release. We specifically focus on sources with at least 20 observation epochs that clearly exhibit long-term radial velocity (RV) variations while remaining stable over short time scales. By constraining the mass function with Lomb-Scargle periods and RV ranges, we identified 76 single-lined spectroscopic binary candidates harboring potential compact objects with robust orbital solutions. These systems exhibit orbital periods ranging from 10 to 1000 days, with semi-amplitudes of velocity $K_1 \lesssim 50$ km/s and mass functions $f(M_2)$ between 0.05 and 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. Combining $f(M_2)$ with SED-derived stellar parameters, we identify 6 strong compact object candidates with main-sequence companions (Class A), 24 systems likely consisting of either compact objects with giant/subgiant companions or mass-inverted Algol-type binaries (Class B), and 46 candidates with relatively lower mass ratios (Class C). Cross-matching with the Gaia DR3 nss_two_star_orbit catalog yields 16 sources, all of which exhibit orbital solutions consistent with our results. This study demonstrates the essential role of long-term spectroscopic monitoring in searching for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries and validating orbital solutions. The strategy of leveraging extended time baselines will be increasingly effective as spectroscopic databases continue to grow, enabling the systematic discovery of compact objects in wide orbits across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Correlation Length of Turbulence in Magnetic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale limit or outer scale of turbulence in the solar wind is associated with the correlation length of the magnetic field. Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed. Finally, we discuss the possible relation of turbulence correlation lengths to mesoscale structure in magnetic clouds.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dynamo-Generated Large-Scale Magnetic Fields on the Surface Gravity ($f$) Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By modelling the upper layers of the Sun in terms of a two-layer setup where a free-surface exists within the computational domain, we numerically study the interaction between the surface gravity, or the fundamental ($f$) mode, and the magnetic fields. Earlier such works were idealized in the sense that the static magnetic fields were imposed below the photosphere, i.e., the free-surface, to detect signatures of sub-surface magnetic fields and flows on the $f$-mode. In this work, we perform three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations where the interior fluid below the photosphere is stirred helically at small scales, thus facilitating an $\alpha^2$-dynamo. This allows us to investigate how these self-consistently generated large-scale magnetic fields influence the properties of the $f$-mode. We find that when the magnetic fields saturate near the equipartition values with the turbulent kinetic energy of the flow, the $f$-mode is significantly perturbed. Compared to the non-magnetic case, or the kinematic phase of the dynamo when fields are too weak, we note that the frequencies and the strengths of the $f$-mode are enhanced in presence of saturated magnetic fields, with these effects being larger at larger wavenumbers. This qualitatively confirms the earlier findings from observational and numerical works which reported the $f$-mode strengthening due to strong sub-surface magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>MESS: Multi-Epoch Spectroscopic Solver for Detecting Double-Lined Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MESS, a fully automated algorithm for identifying and characterizing double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) in large databases of multi-epoch spectra. MESS extends the two-dimensional TODCOR approach to a global multi-epoch formalism, deriving the radial velocities (RVs) of both components at each epoch while optimizing the templates jointly across all observations. Template optimization searches a continuous synthetic-spectra manifold spanning an eight-dimensional parameter space: effective temperature, surface gravity, and rotational broadening for each star, together with a common metallicity and the flux ratio. Single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) and single stars (S1) are handled within the same framework by fitting one optimized template, with either epoch-dependent RVs (SB1) or a single shared RV (S1). Model selection among S1/SB1/SB2 uses the Bayesian information criterion with an effective sample size that accounts for intra-spectrum correlations, and is complemented by the Wilson relation between the two RVs to infer the mass ratio and systemic velocity without a full orbital solution. We validate MESS on 1500 simulated LAMOST MRS systems (SNR=50), with primary RV semi-amplitudes predominantly below the instrumental resolution, achieving an overall classification accuracy of ~95%. We also derive full orbital solutions for two SB2 systems detected in our LAMOST analysis, including a faint-secondary case with flux ratio ~0.1, and present example outputs for one SB1 and three constant-velocity stars. A companion paper will report the survey-wide application to LAMOST DR11 and the resulting SB1/SB2 catalogs.</description>

      <title>Photometric variability of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars in Magellanic Clouds with OGLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric variability of (presumably single) nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WN) stars in the Magellanic Clouds, using long-term observations from the OGLE survey. Our sample comprises 47 stars with no nearby Gaia counterparts. We characterize both overall and short-term variabilities, examining data dispersion and identifying periodicities. To validate our findings, we also compare the OGLE light curves with data from the MACHO and TESS missions. Variability is ubiquitous in our WR sample: about one third of stars display high variability, or four fifths if we include cases with moderate variations. The observed changes are found to be periodic in 11 cases, with timescales of 2-56 d. Such periodic variations originate in corotating wind structures, binary effects, or pulsations, thereby increasing the number of systems known to show these phenomena. Surprisingly, nine targets display (quasi-periodic) outbursts, making such changes a new type of WR variability. The variability shows a transient character, in about 30$\%$ of the sample, with changing amplitudes for periodic signals or for outbursts (they even sometimes completely disappear from view). Finally, we identified six long-period variables, four of which have been confirmed by at least two independent surveys.</description>

      <title>Oort Cloud Bombardment by Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization that primordial black holes (PBHs) might be some fraction of the dark matter begged the question, how often do PBHs enter the solar system? For a Neptune radius solar system the answer is, rarely. For an Oort cloud sized system the answer is different. Simulations of bombardment of the Oort cloud by dark matter suggest that dislodgement of protocomets and their entry into the inner solar system can match the observed frequency of comets, if that PBH fraction is high enough. Comets were traditionally considered as messengers, usually omens. After 50 years of puzzlement regarding dark matter, we need a hint from the dark universe about the size and nature of dark matter particles.</description>

      <title>Abundant hydrocarbons in a buried galactic nucleus with signs of carbonaceous grain and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrocarbons play a key role in shaping the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM), but their enrichment and relationship with carbonaceous grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) still lack clear observational constraints. We report JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS infrared (IR; 3-28 micron) observations of the local ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 07251-0248, revealing the extragalactic detection of small gas-phase hydrocarbons such as benzene (C$_6$H$_6$), triacetylene (C$_6$H$_2$), diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$), acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and methyl radical (CH$_3$) as well as deep amorphous C-H absorptions in the solid phase. The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C$_2$H$_2$, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs. These hydrocarbons are outflowing at $\sim$160 km/s, which may represent a potential formation pathway for hydrogenated amorphous grains. Our results suggest that IRAS 07251-0248 might not be unique but represents an extreme example of the commonly rich hydrocarbon chemistry prevalent in deeply obscured galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>ALMA 873 $\mu$m Polarization Observations of the PDS~70 Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a 112.4 pc distance, the PDS70 protoplanetary disk is a rare case that has been confirmed to host two accreting planets. This makes it the most important laboratory for studying dust growth in the context of planet formation. Here we present the first deep, full polarization observations at 873 $\mu$m wavelength. We detected $\sim$1%-2.5% linear polarization over the bulk of the $\sim$55-100 AU (sub)millimeter ring. The polarization position angles align preferentially with the projected minor axis of the disk. The standard interpretation is that the observed polarization is caused by dust self-scattering, with a maximum dust grain size of $\sim$100 $\mu$m. On $\gtrsim$10 AU scales, which can be resolved by the presented 873-3075 $\mu$m observations, the ring is marginally optical thick at 873 $\mu$m wavelength. Using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we found that an azimuthally asymmetric, marginally optically thick ring with a maximum dust grain size of $\sim$87 $\mu$m can reproduce the observed 873 $\mu$m polarization position angles and percentages. This study indicates that the coagulation of ice-coated dust in the protoplanetary disk may be limited by fragmentation or bouncing.</description>

      <title>A Chemistry-First Centered Icy Chemical Inventory of Protostellar Sources with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical evolution in star forming regions is driven by the interplay between gas and ice mantles. Identifying the ice compositions at the early stage of star formation thus provides constraints on the chemical processes inaccessible from gas-phase characterizations. As part of the CORINOS program, spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS were taken toward four Class 0 protostars: IRAS 15398-3359, Ser-emb7, L483, and B335. The spectra were processed with simultaneous fitting of a continuum and silicate absorption to produce optical depth mid-infrared spectra of the ices at 5-28 $\mu$m (360-2000 cm$^{-1}$) toward these four sources. Simple molecules such as water (H$_2$O), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methanol (CH$_3$OH), formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO$^-$), ammonia/ammonium (NH$_3$/NH$_4$$^+$), and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are the most abundant features in these ices, while complex organic molecules (COMs) represent a smaller contribution. Likely COMs include hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH), methylamine (CH$_3$NH$_2$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). Absorption features belonging to functional groups such as -CH$_3$ and -OH suggest that additional COMs are present, but these cannot be unambiguously assigned due to overlapping bands. Formation pathways toward these COMs utilizing radical-radical combination reactions based on laboratory simulation experiments is presented. By extension, COMs predicted by these reactions, but absent from the spectra, are discussed. The results provide insight into the chemical environment of these ices and also highlight the critical need for caution and sufficient evidence in order to confidently identify COMs in ice.</description>

      <title>On the stability of viscous Riemann ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear stability of Riemann ellipsoids in both the inviscid limit and in the presence of weak viscosity. In the inviscid regime, we derive a generalised Poincare equation governing small fluid oscillations and construct a family of polynomial solutions that extends the classical results of Cartan to flows with a uniform strain field. This formulation provides an analytic dispersion relation for three-dimensional ellipsoidal disturbances and remains computationally efficient at arbitrary harmonic degree, in contrast to the virial tensor method or to short-wavelength (WKB) approximations. The viscous effects are incorporated through a boundary-layer analysis based on Prandtls theory, leading to first-order viscous corrections to the inviscid spectrum and allowing a systematic investigation of viscosity-driven instabilities. Stability diagrams are presented over the space of admissible Riemann ellipsoids, illustrating the roles of rotation, internal strain, and diffusion, with implications for rotating shear flows in geophysical and astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Interacting binaries on the Main Sequence as in-situ tracers of mass transfer efficiency and stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the transfer of mass and angular momentum in binary interactions is crucial for modelling the evolution of any interacting binary after the first mass transfer phase. Mass transfer physics assumptions shape the predictions for later stages of binary evolution, such as the immediate progenitors of stripped-envelope supernovae and gravitational wave mergers. We constrain the efficiency and stability of thermal timescale mass transfer in massive binary evolution using the observed population of 62 massive interacting binaries on the Main Sequence (`Algols') in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We find that purely conservative or non-conservative mass transfer cannot explain the current mass ratio and orbital period of all massive Algols. Angular momentum conservation rules out conservative mass transfer in $\sim$28\,\% of massive Algols in the SMC. About three-quarters of all massive Algols are consistent with having undergone inefficient mass transfer ($\lesssim$\,50\,\%), while the remaining systems, mostly residing in the LMC and Milky Way, require mass transfer to have been more efficient than 25\%. For our fiducial assumption on the extent of envelope stripping, the current sample of massive Algols does not require mass transfer to be efficient at the shortest orbital periods ($\sim$2\,d) at any metallicity. We find evidence that mass transfer on the Main Sequence needs to be stable for initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios as unequal as $\sim 0.6$. Unless biased by observational selection effects, the massive Algols in the SMC seem to have undergone less efficient mass transfer than those in the LMC and Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Fast Magnetoacoustic Wave Behavior within Gravitationally Stratified, Magnetically Inhomogeneous Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of MHD waves within inhomogeneous media is fundamental to understanding and interpreting wave behavior in the solar atmosphere. We investigate fast magnetoacoustic wave behavior within gravitationally stratified, magnetically inhomogeneous media, by studying a magnetic environment containing a simple 2D X-type magnetic null point. The addition of gravitational stratification fundamentally changes the nature of the system, including breaking the symmetry. There are two main governing effects: the stratified density profile acts in combination with the inhomogeneous magnetic field, creating a large gradient in the Alfven speed and hence a system replete with refraction. The system is investigated using both numerical simulations and a semianalytical WKB solution (via Charpit's method and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver) and we find strong agreement between both. The results show a fundamental difference between the stratification-free and stratified cases, including the formation of caustic surfaces and cusps, and we contextualize these results in the theoretical understanding of fast magnetoacoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Orbital Eccentricity and Spin-Orbit Misalignment Are Evidence that Neutron Star-Black Hole Mergers Form through Triple Star Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that a substantial fraction of the neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) detected through gravitational waves merge with non-zero eccentricity or large BH spin-orbit misalignment. This is in tension with the leading formation scenarios to date. Residual eccentricity rules out formation through isolated binary star evolution, while NS natal kicks and the unequal masses of NSBHs inhibit efficient pairing in dense stellar environments. Here, we report that all observed properties-NSBH merger rate, eccentricity, and spin-orbit misalignment-are explained by the high prevalence of massive stellar triples in the field. Modelling their evolution from the ZAMS, we investigate NSBH mergers caused by gravitational perturbations from a tertiary companion. We show that the formation of the NS decisively impacts the triple stability, preferentially leaving behind surviving NSBHs in compact triple architectures. The rich three-body dynamics of compact, unequal-mass triples enables mergers across a wide range of orbital parameters without requiring fine-tuned highly inclined tertiary orbits and provides a natural explanation for an abundance of residual eccentricity and spin-orbit misalignment. We infer a total NSBH merger rate of $R\sim1-23\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, with more than a few 10% exhibiting eccentricity $e_{20}&gt;0.1$ or large spin-orbit misalignment $\cos\theta_{\rm BH}&lt;0$, consistent with current observations. Tertiary-driven NSBH mergers closely track the cosmic star formation rate due to their short delay times, include a substantial fraction of burst-like highly eccentric systems ($e_{20} &gt; 0.9$), and almost universally retain eccentricities $e_{20}&gt;10^{-3}$, potentially detectable by next-generation detectors. If evidence for eccentric and misaligned events solidifies, our results suggest that triple dynamics is the dominant formation channel of NSBH mergers.</description>

      <title>Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f&gt;0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Distinct Rotational Evolution of Giant Planets and Brown Dwarf Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $\sigma$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $\sigma$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.</description>
