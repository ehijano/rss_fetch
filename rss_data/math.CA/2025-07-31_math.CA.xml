      <title>Zeros of linear combinations of Laguerre polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the number of real zeros of finite combinations of $K+1$ consecutive normalized Laguerre polynomials of the form $$ q_n(x)=\sum_{j=0}^K\gamma_j\tilde L^\alpha_{n-j}(x),\quad n\ge K, $$ where $\gamma_j$, $j=0,\cdots ,K$, are real numbers with $\gamma_0=1$, $\gamma_K\not =0$. We consider four different normalizations of Laguerre polynomials: the monic Laguerre polynomials $\hat L_n^\alpha$, the polynomials $\mathcal L_n^\alpha=n!L_n^\alpha/(1+\alpha)_n$ (so that $\mathcal L_n^\alpha(0)=1$), the standard Laguerre polynomials $(L_n^\alpha)_n$ and the Brenke normalization $L_n^\alpha/(1+\alpha)_n$. We show the key role played by the polynomials $Q(x)=\sum_{j=0}^K(-1)^j\gamma_j(x)_{K-j}$ and $P(x)=\sum_{j=0}^K\gamma_jx^{K-j}$ to solve this problem: $Q$ in the first case and $P$ in the second, third and forth cases. In particular, in the first case, if all the zeros of the polynomial $Q$ are real and less than $\alpha+1$, then all the zeros of $q_n$, $n\ge K$, are positive. In the other cases, if all the zeros of $P$ are real then all the zeros of $q_n$, $n\ge K$, are also real. If $P$ has $m&gt;1$ non-real zeros, there are important differences between the four cases. For instance in the first case, $q_n$ has still only real zeros for $n$ big enough, but in the fourth case $q_n$ has exactly $m$ non-real zeros for $n$ big enough.</description>

      <title>Maximal average over surfaces of codimension 2 in $\mathbb R^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain sharp $L^p$ improving estimates for maximal averages over nondegenerate surfaces of codimension $2$ in $\mathbb R^4$. We also establish local smoothing type estimates for the averages, which are accomplished by making use of multilinear restriction estimates and decoupling inequalities for two dimensional conic extension of two dimensional nondegenerate surfaces.</description>

      <title>Assouad type spectra for some self-affine sponges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the Assouad and lower spectra of Bedford--McMullen sponges in $\mathbb{R}^3$ explicitly. According to the formulae established, we discover that the spectra are not determined by the ratio set, and the box, lower and Assouad dimensions of the sponge anymore, which is unlike the situation in a planar carpet. As a by-product, we construct two Bedford--McMullen sponges on the same grid, both of which have non-uniform fibres. Particularly, they share the same box, lower and Assouad dimensions. However, their Assouad type spectra are different and therefore they are not bi-Lipschitz equivalent. For Bedford--McMullen sponges in higher dimensions, we also determine the dimension spectra when $\theta$ is smaller than the minimal ratio or it is bigger than the maximal ratio.</description>

      <title>Arnol'd's limit and the Lagrange inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to prove by means of the Lagrange inversion the limit of Arnol'd that $$ \lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin(\tan x)-\tan(\sin x)}{\arcsin(\arctan x)-\arctan(\arcsin x)}=1\,. $$ In fact, we obtain a more general result in terms of formal power series.</description>

      <title>Interrelation among Solvable Potentials and Extensions of SWKB Quantization Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exactly solvable Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the conventional shape-invariant potentials are known to be related with each other through point cannonical transformations. In this paper, we extend the idea to integral formulae called the SWKB integrals. By virtue of this, we derive extended forms of the SWKB quantization condition for certain classes of Natanzon potentials. We further demonstrate that the same idea can also be applied to obtain an exact quantization rule for a subclass of quantum systems with position-dependent effective masses, provided their solutions involve the classical orthogonal polynomials. Based on the findings, we conjecture about the implication of the exactness of the SWKB formula in relation to the classical orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Reflection equation with piecewise constant argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study nonlocal differential equations with particular focus on those with reflection in their argument and piecewise constant dependence. The approach entails deriving the explicit expression of the solution to the linear problem by constructing the corresponding Green's function, as well as developing a novel formula to delineate the set of parameters involved in the analyzed equations for which the Green's function exhibits a constant sign. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of solutions for nonlinear problems through the utilisation of the monotone method.
  The aforementioned methodology is specifically applied to the linear problem with periodic conditions $v'(t) + mv(-t) + Mv([t]) = h(t)$ for $t \in [-T,T]$, proving several existence results for the associated nonlinear problem and precisely delimiting the region where the Green's function $H_{m,M}$ has a constant sign on its domain of definition.
  The equations studied have the potential to be applied in fields such as biomedicine or quantum mechanics. Furthermore, this work represents a significant advance, as it is, as far the authors know, the first time that equations with involution and piecewise constant arguments have been studied together.</description>

      <title>A topological algorithm for the Fourier transform of Stokes data at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a topological description of the behaviour of Stokes matrices under the Fourier transform from infinity to infinity in a large number of cases of one level. This explicit, algorithmic statement is obtained by building on a recent result of T. Mochizuki about the Fourier transform of Stokes data of irregular connections on the Riemann sphere and by using the language of Stokes local systems due to P. Boalch. In particular, this induces explicit isomorphisms between wild character varieties, in a much larger range of examples than those for which such isomorphisms have previously been written down. We conjecture that these isomorphisms are compatible with the quasi-Hamiltonian structure on the wild character varieties.</description>
