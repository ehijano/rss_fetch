      <title>Quantizing the Bosonic String on a Loop Quantum Gravity Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the goal of understanding whether or not it is possible to construct a string theory which is consistent with loop quantum gravity (LQG), we study alternate versions of the Nambu-Goto action for a bosonic string. We consider two types of modifications. The first is a phenomenological action based on the observation that LQG tells us that areas of two-surfaces are operators in quantum geometry and are bounded from below. This leads us to a string action which is similar to that of bimetric gravity. We provide formulations of the bimetric string for both the Nambu-Goto (second order) and Polyakov (first order) formulations. We explore the classical solutions of this action and its quantization and relate it to the conventional string solutions.
  The second is an action in which the background geometry is described in terms of the pullback of the connection which describes the bulk geometry to the worldsheet. The resulting action is in the form of a gauged sigma model, where the spacetime co-ordinates are now vectors which transform under $ISO(D,1)$. We find that for the particular case of a constant background connection the action reduces to the bimetric action discussed above. We discuss classical solutions and quantization strategies for this action and its implications for the broader program of unifying string theory and loop quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Schwinger vs Coleman: Magnetic Charge Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic mixing of two U(1) gauge theories can result in a massless photon that has perturbative couplings to both electric and magnetic charges. This framework can be used to perturbatively calculate in a quantum field theory with both kinds of charge. Here we re-examine the running of the magnetic charge, where the calculations of Schwinger and Coleman sharply disagree. We calculate the running of both electric and magnetic couplings and show that the disagreement between Schwinger and Coleman is due to an incomplete summation of topological terms in the perturbation series. We present a momentum space prescription for calculating the loop corrections in which the topological terms can be systematically separated for resummation. Somewhat in the spirit of modern amplitude methods we avoid using a vector potential and use the field strength itself, thereby trading gauge redundancy for the geometric redundancy of Stokes surfaces. The resulting running of the couplings demonstrates that Dirac charge quantization is independent of renormalization scale, as Coleman predicted. As a simple application we also bound the parameter space of magnetically charged states through the experimental measurement of the running of electromagnetic coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calabi--Yau compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string provide a promising route to recovering the four-dimensional particle physics described by the Standard Model. While the topology of the Calabi--Yau space determines the overall matter content in the low-energy effective field theory, further details of the compactification geometry are needed to calculate the normalized physical couplings and masses of elementary particles. In this work, we present numerical computations of physical Yukawa couplings in a number of heterotic models in the standard embedding and demonstrate the existence of natural hierarchies, a coveted feature in string model building.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure of scalar-Maxwell theory at the null boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the Hamiltonian formalism to investigate the massless sector of scalar field theory coupled with Maxwell electrodynamics through the Pontryagin term. Specifically, we analyze asymptotic symmetries at the null infinity of this theory, conserved charges, and their algebra. We find that the theory possesses asymptotic shift symmetries of the fields not present in the bulk manifold coming from the zero modes of the symplectic matrix of constraints. Consequently, we conclude that the real scalar field also contains asymptotic symmetries previously found in the literature by a different approach. We show that these symmetries are the origin of the electric-magnetic duality in electromagnetism with the topological Pontryagin term, and obtain non-trivial central extension between the electric and magnetic conserved charges. Finally, we examine the full interacting theory and find that, due to the interaction, the symmetry generators are more difficult to identify among the constraints, such that we obtain them in the weak-coupling limit. We find that the asymptotic structure of the theory simplifies due to a fast fall-off of the scalar field, leading to decoupled scalar and Maxwell asymptotic sectors, and losing the electric-magnetic duality.</description>

      <title>What is the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for holographic superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained analytically.</description>

      <title>On gauge amplitudes first appearing at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scattering amplitudes in massless non-abelian gauge theory where all outgoing gluons have positive helicity. It has been argued recently by Costello that for a particular fermion representation (8 fundamentals plus one antisymmetric-tensor representation in $SU(N)$) the one-loop amplitudes vanish identically. We show that this vanishing leads to previously-observed identities among one-loop color-ordered partial amplitudes. We then turn to two loops, where Costello has computed the all-plus amplitudes for this theory, as rational functions of the kinematics for any number of gluons using the celestial chiral algebra (CCA) bootstrap. We show that in dimensional regularization, these two-loop amplitudes are not rational, and they are not even finite as $\epsilon\to0$. However, the finite remainder for four gluons agrees with the formula by Costello. In addition, we provide a mass regulator for the infrared-divergent loop integrals; with this regulator, the CCA bootstrap formula is recovered exactly. Finally, we use the CCA bootstrap to compute the double-trace terms in the theory at two loops for an arbitrary number of gluons.</description>

      <title>Barrow's non-linear charged Anti-de Sitter black hole and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we know that the horizon area of a black hole will increase when it absorbs matters. While based on Barrow's idea of fractal black hole horizon, ones [Phys. Lett. B 831 (137181) 2022] had proposed that for a spherically fractal structure the minimal increase of the horizon area is the area of the smallest bubble sphere. And the corresponding black hole entropy is of a logarithmic form, which is similar to that of Boltzmann entropy under a certain condition. Based on these, we re-derive the entropy of the Barrow's Einstein-power-Yang-Mills (EPYM) AdS black hole, and calculate the temperature and heat capacity of the Barrow's EPYM AdS black hole. There exists an interesting phenomena that the ratio between the Barrow's temperature and the Hawking temperature of the EPYM AdS black hole is fully consistent with that of other Schwarzschild-like black holes. The Barrow's temperature and Hawking temperature with the certain range of $\Lambda$ are monotonically increasing and the corresponding heat capacities are all positive, which means these black holes are thermodynamically stable. Besides, for the Barrow's EPYM AdS black hole its heat capacity has a Schottky anomaly-like behavior, which may reflect the existence of the discrete energy level and the microscopical degree of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relevance of the central hill for a symmetric double-well potential and its impact on the scattering of kinks in a scalar field theory in (1+1)-dimensions. This region controls the inner core structure of the kink. We study how the disappearance of analyticity in this region of the potential affects the resonant features in $K\bar{K}$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou coordinates, self-dual Yang-Mills equations and the single copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction to two dimensions of certain gravitational theories in $D \geq 4$ dimensions at the two-derivative level. It is known that the resulting field equations describe an integrable system in two dimensions which can also be obtained by a dimensional reduction of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions. We use this relation to construct a single copy prescription for classes of gravitational solutions in Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou coordinates. In contrast with previous proposals, we find that the gauge group of the Yang-Mills single copy carries non-trivial information about the gravitational solution. We illustrate our single copy prescription with various examples that include the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom solution, the Kaluza-Klein rotating attractor solution, the Einstein-Rosen wave solution and the self-dual Kleinian Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Beta-Function Dependence on Running Coupling in Holographic QCD Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dependence of beta-function on running coupling constant in holographic models supported by Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell action for light and heavy quarks. Although, in the previous paper [arXiv:2402.14512], we considered different types of the dilaton boundary conditions, but since the behavior of $\beta$-function as a function of running coupling does not depend significantly on the boundary condition, we chose one. The corresponding $\beta$-functions are negative and monotonically decreasing functions, and have jumps on the 1-st order phase transitions for both light and heavy quarks. In addition, we compare our holographic results for $\beta$-function as a function of running coupling with perturbation results that obtained within 2-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>AdS Carroll Structures from Poincar\'e Isomorphism: Asymptotic Symmetry Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the isomorphism between the AdS Carroll and Poincar\'e algebras, we map the three-dimensional asymptotically flat solutions of Poincar\'e gravity into an AdS Carroll spacetime. We show the mapped solutions satisfy the field equations of the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS Carroll gravity and exhibit a Carroll geometry structure. Despite the presence of a negative cosmological constant in the mapped spacetime, the algebra of the canonical generators of the asymptotic symmetries is given by the $\mathfrak{bms}_3$ algebra.</description>

      <title>Radiation-like Shock Waves in Kink Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radiation in kink collision via a model that varies between $\phi^6$ theory and $\phi^2$ theory with some discontinuities. Both numerical and analytical methods were used to investigate The kink-antikink(KAK) and antikink-kink(AKK) collision. In the numerical analysis, we found the critical velocities in both collisions increased with $n$. We also found a finite lifetime oscillon window in KAK collision for $n=2$. In the analytical part, we found a family of shock wave solutions that describes radiation in the kink collision perfectly. Moreover, an analytical AKK solution at $n\rightarrow\infty$ and $v=1$ was found by considering a certain limit of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work I have shown that Herglotz actions reproduce the dynamics of classical mechanical theories which exhibit dynamical similarities. Recent work has shown how to extend field theories in both the Lagrangian and de Donder-Weyl formalism to contact geometry. In this article I show how dynamical similarity applies in field theory. This is applied in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, producing the contact equivalents. The result can be applied to general relativity where I demonstrate how to construct a complete description of the dynamics, equivalent to those derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action, without reference to the conformal factor.</description>

      <title>Morris-Thorne-type Wormhole with Global Monopole Charge and the Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate topologically charged Morris-Thorne-type wormholes using various shape function forms. We solve the Einstein field equations incorporating an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor and obtain different physical quantities associated with the matter content. A crucial aspect of this study is the non-exotic matter distribution, examined through the evaluation of energy conditions, and exploring how different shape functions impact these conditions. Additionally, the anisotropy parameter is calculated to quantify the extent of attractive or repulsive behavior. Our study demonstrates that for different types of shape function forms, the energy conditions are influenced by the global monopole parameter. Our findings provide valuable insights for further theoretical explorations of these fascinating hypothetical structures in the realm of general relativity and beyond</description>

      <title>Ontological States in Non-Interacting Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a paper in the field of ontological deterministic theories behind Quantum Field Theories, like for example the cellular automaton theories proposed by 't Hooft. In these theories one has ontological states in which the state of reality is exactly known and no uncertainties are present. Also these states evolve in time deterministically. A first step in finding the ontological deterministic theory behind the Standard Model is to find in Quantum Field Theory the states that behave as ontological states. We present the ontological states for all non-interacting (3+1-dimensional) Quantum Field Theories occurring in the Standard Model. We summarize the ontological states for free scalar bosons and for free masless Dirac fermions, which are known from the literature. We construct the ontological states for vector bosons, in analogy to the scalar boson case. With this we have a set of ontological states for all particles that are known to occur in reality and in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Wakes of Jets with Energy-Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the partons in a jet propagate through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in a heavy-ion collision, they lose energy to, kick, and are kicked by the medium. The resulting modifications to the parton shower encode information about the microscopic nature of QGP. The momentum and energy lost by the parton shower are gained by the medium and, since QGP is a strongly coupled liquid, this means that the jet excites a wake in the droplet of QGP. After freezeout, this wake becomes soft hadrons with net momentum in the jet direction meaning that reconstructed jets include hadrons originating from both the modified parton shower and its wake. This makes it challenging to find an unambiguous experimental view of the response of a droplet of QGP to a jet. Recent years have seen significant advances in the understanding of the substructure of jets using correlation functions of the energy flux operator. So far, such studies have focused primarily on the two-point correlator, which serves to identify the angular scale of the underlying dynamics. Higher-point correlators hold the promise of mapping out the dynamics themselves. We perform the first study of the shape-dependent three-point energy-energy-energy correlator in heavy-ion collisions. Using the Hybrid Model to simulate the interactions of high energy jets with QGP, we show that hadrons originating from wakes are the dominant contribution to the three-point correlator in the regime where the three points are well-separated in angle, forming a roughly equilateral triangle. This equilateral region of the correlator is far from the region populated by collinear vacuum emissions, making it a canvas on which jet wakes can be imaged. Our work is a key step towards the systematic use of energy correlators to image and unravel the dynamical response of a droplet of QGP to a passing jet, and motivates many experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of phantom cold dark matter from spacetime diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A way to reconcile general relativity and quantum field theory without quantising the geometry is to demand the metric evolve stochastically. In this article, we explore the consequences of such a proposal at early cosmological times. We find the stochastic evolution results in the spatial metric diffusing away from its deterministic value, generating phantom cold dark matter (CDM). It is produced primarily at the end of the inflationary phase of the Universe's evolution, with a statistical distribution that depends on the specifics of the early-times cosmological model. We find the energy density of this phantom cold dark matter is positive on average, a necessary condition to reproduce the cosmological phenomenology of CDM, although further work is required to calculate its mean density and spatial distribution. If the density is cosmologically significant, phantom dark matter acts on the geometry in a way that is indistinguishable from conventional CDM. As such, it has the potential to reproduce phenomenology such as structure formation, lensing, and galactic rotation curves. We conclude by discussing the possibility of testing hybrid theories of gravity by combining measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background with tabletop experiments.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic charge transport in strongly magnetized relativistic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate electrical charge transport in hot magnetized plasma using first-principles quantum field theoretical methods. By employing Kubo's linear response theory, we express the electrical conductivity tensor in terms of the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation. Utilizing leading-order results for the damping rates from a recent study within a gauge theory, we derive the transverse and longitudinal conductivities for a strongly magnetized plasma. The analytical expressions reveal drastically different mechanisms that explain the high anisotropy of charge transport in a magnetized plasma. Specifically, the transverse conductivity is suppressed, while the longitudinal conductivity is enhanced by a strong magnetic field. As in the case of zero magnetic field, longitudinal conduction is determined by the probability of charge carriers to remain in their quantum states without damping. In contrast, transverse conduction critically relies on quantum transitions between Landau levels, effectively lifting charge trapping in localized Landau orbits. We examine the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transverse and longitudinal electrical conductivities over a wide range of parameters and investigate the effects of a nonzero chemical potential. Additionally, we extend our analysis to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and study the impact of the coupling constant on the anisotropy of electrical charge transport.</description>

      <title>On the field analogue of elliptic spin Calogero-Moser model: Lax pair and equations of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lax pair for the field analogue of the classical spin elliptic Calogero-Moser is proposed. Namely, using the previously known Lax matrix we suggest an ansatz for the accompany matrix. The presented construction is valid when the matrix of spin variables ${\mathcal S}\in{\rm Mat}(N,\mathbb C)$ satisfies the condition ${\mathcal S}^2=c_0{\mathcal S}$ with some constant $c_0\in\mathbb C$. It is proved that the Lax pair satisfies the Zakharov-Shabat equation with unwanted term, thus providing equations of motion on the unreduced phase space. The unwanted term vanishes after additional reduction. In the special case ${\rm rank}(\mathcal S)=1$ we show that the reduction provides the Lax pair of the spinless field Calogero-Moser model obtained earlier by Akhmetshin, Krichever and Volvovski.</description>

      <title>Nonmetricity and Poincare gauge gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in a spacetime geometry with general connection, there exist field redefinitions that replace the mixed-symmetry nonmetricity of the asymmetric connection with the sum of torsion and the field strength of special conformal transformations of a Lorentzian connection. In contrast to general relativity, generic action functionals give different results for metric versus Palatini-style variations. We consider some of the resulting issues in Poincar\`e gauge theory, where it is natural to vary both the solder form and the spin connection, and where the action may differ from the Einstein-Hilbert case. Independent variation may introduce nonmetricity as well as torsion. Appending the defining equation of nonmetricity to the Maurer-Cartan equations of the Poincar\`e Lie algebra, we show that the mixed symmetry components of nonmetricity can be absorbed into an altered torsion tensor, restoring local Lorentz symmetry and metric compatibility while including quadratic terms in the redefined curvature. In order to recover the original torsion and nonmetric fields, we replace the definition of nonmetricity by an additional structure equation. We show that the maximal Lie algebra compatible with the enlarged set is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra. Therefore, in a Lorentzian conformal geometry the sum of torsion and the field strength of special conformal transformations is given by the mixed symmetry nonmetricity of an equivalent asymmetric system.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Flat Rotation Curves in Chern-Simons Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit slow rotating black hole (BH) solutions in Chern-Simons modified gravity (CSMG) by considering perturbative solution about Schwarzschild BH. In particular, the case when nondynamical CSMG with noncanonical CS scalar is considered. We provide a new solution different from the previously obtained one \cite{Konno:2007ze} which we refer to as KMT model. The present solution accounts for frame dragging effect which includes not only radial dependence as in the KMT. Nevertheless, it reduces to KMT as a particular case. We show that the tidal gravitational force (Kretschmann invariant) associated to the present solution contains a term of order $1/r^3$ additional to Schwarzschild but absent from directional divergence, unlike KMT model which diverges along the axis of symmetry. We derive the corresponding circular velocity of a massive test particle in which the KMT velocity is recovered in addition to an extra term $\propto r$. We investigate possible constraints on KMT and the present solutions from the observed rotation curve of UGC11455 galaxy as an example. We show that perturbation solutions cannot physically explain the flattening of galactic rotation curves.</description>

      <title>From the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularities to Einstein-Maxwell phantom wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime corresponds to a static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein equations with the energy momentum tensor of a massless quintessence field. It is understood that the spacetime describes a naked singularity. The solution has two parameters, $b$ and $s$. To our knowledge, the exact physical meaning of the two parameters is still unclear. In this paper, starting from the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution, we first obtain a wormhole solution by a complex transformation. Then let the parameter $s$ approaching infinity, we obtain the well-known exponential wormhole solution. After that, we embed both the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity and its wormhole counterpart in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe with the energy momentum tensor of massive quintessence and massive phantom fields, respectively. To our surprise, the resulting quintessence potential is actually the dilaton potential found by one of us. It hints us that, by modulating the parameters in the charged dilaton black hole solutions we can get the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution. Furthermore, a charged wormhole solution is obtained by performing complex transformation on the charged dilaton black hole solutions in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe. We eventually find that $s$ is actually related to the coupling constant of dilaton field to Maxwell field and $b$ is related to a negative mass for the dilaton black holes. A negative black hole mass is physically forbidden. Therefore, we conclude that the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution is not physically allowed.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Perturbed Black Holes: Background Hidden Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of integrable hidden structures in the dynamics of perturbed non-rotating black holes (BHs). This can also be considered as a first step in a wider program of an effective identification of ``slow'' and ``fast'' degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the (binary) BH dynamics, following a wave-mean flow perspective. The slow DoFs would be associated with a nonlinear integrable dynamics, on which the fast ones propagate following an effective linear dynamics. BH perturbation theory offers a natural ground to test these properties. Indeed, the decoupling of Einstein equations into wave master equations with a potential provides an instance of such splitting into (frozen) slow DoFs (background potential) over which the linear dynamics of the fast ones (perturbation master functions) evolve. It has been recently shown that these wave equations possess an infinite number of symmetries that correspond to the flow of the infinite hierarchy of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations. Starting from these results, we systematically investigate the presence of integrable structures in BH perturbation theory. We first study them in Cauchy slices and then extend the analysis to hyperboloidal foliations. This second step introduces a splitting of the master equation into bulk and boundary contributions, unveiling an underlying structural relation with the slow and fast DoFs. This insight represents a first step to establish the integrable structures associated to the slow DoFs as bulk symmetries of the dynamics of perturbed BHs.</description>

Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions this ambiguity is resolved. We prove that the mean field limit of this theory is equivalent to the non-dissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor. Finally, we propose to detect the spin potential by performing experiments with collisions of polarized ions.</description>

      <title>On AdS black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present three analytic AdS black hole solutions in a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory, which contains two scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity. Our solutions I and II contain two arbitrary integration constants in the blackening factor $f(r)$, with which we can impose an extremality condition. Solution I coincides with a previously reported AdS black hole when one of the integration constants vanishes in $f(r)$ and we have only one non-trivial scalar field. Solution III corresponds to an extreme black hole configuration with an asymptotically finite constant dilaton field. For all of our solutions, both non-extremal and extremal, the scalar curvature is constant and negative, corresponding to $AdS_2$ spacetime. Thus, we show that pure $AdS_2$ geometry arises outside the event horizon of all our black hole configurations, not only in the near horizon region. In order to elucidate their black hole nature, we explore the causal structure of solutions I and II with the aid of suitable Kruskal-like coordinates and Penrose diagrams. By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi method, we construct a boundary counter-term that renders a renormalized action with a vanishing variation. We use this finite action for the partition function in the semi-classical approximation. We establish a consistent Thermodynamics, verified by the first law, across all the black hole solutions presented, including the extreme case.</description>

Abstract: The Schur index of the Higgs branch of 4-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs is related to the spectrum of non-unitary 2-dimensional CFTs. The rank 1 case has been shown to lead to the non-unitary CFTs with Deligne-Cvitanovic (DC) exceptional sequence of Lie groups. We show that a subsequence $(A_0, A_{\frac{1}{2}}, A_1, A_2, D_4)$ within the non-unitary sequence is related to a subsequence in the Mathur-Mukhi-Sen (MMS) sequence of unitary theories. We show that 2D non-unitary $G_2$ theory is related to unitary $E_6$ theory, and using this result along with the Galois conjugation, we propose that the $G_2$ Higgs branch is a sub-branch of the $E_6$ Higgs branch.</description>

      <title>Yukawa Couplings at Infinite Distance and Swampland Towers in Chiral Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study limits of vanishing Yukawa couplings of 4d chiral matter fields in Quantum Gravity, using as a laboratory type IIA orientifolds with D6-branes. In these theories chiral fermions arise at brane intersections, where an infinite tower of charged particles dubbed gonions are localised. We show that in the limit $Y\rightarrow 0$ some of these towers become asymptotically massless, while at the same time the kinetic term of some chiral fields becomes singular and at least two extra dimensions decompactify. For limits parametrised by a large complex structure saxion $u$, Yukawa couplings have a behaviour of the form $Y \, \sim \, {1}/{u^r}$, with $r$ some positive rational number. Moreover, in this limit some of the gauge couplings associated to the Yukawa vanish. The lightest gonion scales are of order $m_{\rm gon} \sim g^s M_{\rm P}$ with $s&gt;1$, verifying the magnetic WGC with room to spare and with no need of its tower/sublattice versions. We also show how this behaviour can be understood in the context of the emergence of kinetic terms in Quantum Gravity. All these results may be very relevant for phenomenology, given the fact that some of the Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are very small.</description>

      <title>Similarities between projective quantum fields and the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many homogeneous, four-dimensional space-time geometries can be considered within real projective geometry, which yields a mathematically well-defined framework for their deformations and limits without the appearance of singularities. Focussing on generalized unitary transformation behavior, projective quantum fields can be axiomatically introduced, which transform smoothly under geometry deformations and limits. Connections on the related projective frame bundles provide gauge fields with gauge group $\mathrm{PGL}_5\mathbb{R}$. For Poincar\'e geometry, on operator level only $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{GL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{GL}_3\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{R}_{\neq 0}\times \mathrm{PGL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{PGL}_3\mathbb{R}$ gauge bosons can interact non-trivially with other projective quantum fields from the non- to ultra-relativistic limits. The corresponding propagating, complexified gauge bosons come with the Standard Model gauge group $G_{\mathrm{SM}}=(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{SU}(3))/\mathbb{Z}_6$. Physical scale transformations can act as global gauge transformations and their spontaneous breaking can lead to masses for the projective quantum fields including the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge bosons. Projective quantum fields, which are irreducible both with respect to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{pgl}_5\mathbb{R}$ and the Poincar\'e group, form Dirac fermions and $G_{\mathrm{SM}}$ gauge bosons interact with them similar to the Standard Model. For homogeneous, curved Lorentz geometries a gauge group similar to the gauge group of metric-affine gravity appears.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the general phenomenon that scattering amplitudes of pions can be obtained from "dimensional reduction" of gluons in higher dimensions in a more general context. We show that such "dimensional reduction" operations universally turn gluons into pions regardless of details of interactions: under such operations any amplitude that is gauge invariant and contains only local simple poles becomes one that satisfies Adler zero in the soft limit. As two such examples, we show that starting from gluon amplitudes in both superstring and bosonic string theories, the operations produce "stringy" completion of pion scattering amplitudes to all orders in $\alpha'$, with leading order given by non-linear sigma model amplitudes. Via Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations, they give closed-stringy completion for Born-Infeld theory and the special Galileon theory, which are directly related to gravity amplitudes in closed-string theories. We also discuss how they naturally produce stringy models for mixed amplitudes of pions and colored scalars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how tiny Dirac neutrino masses consistent with experimental constraints can arise in string theory SM-like vacua. We use as a laboratory 4d ${\cal N}=1$ type IIA Calabi--Yau orientifold compactifications, and in particular recent results on Yukawa couplings at infinite field-space distance. In this regime we find Dirac neutrino masses of the form $m_\nu \simeq g_\nu\langle H\rangle$, with $g_{\nu}$ the gauge coupling of the massive $U(1)$ under which the right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$ are charged, and which should be in the range $g_{\nu}\simeq 10^{-14}-10^{-12}$ to reproduce neutrino data. The neutrino mass suppression occurs because the right-handed neutrino kinetic term behaves as $K_{\nu\nu} \simeq 1 /g_{\nu}^2 $. At the same time a tower of $\nu_R$-like states appears with characteristic scale $m_0\simeq g_{\nu}^2M_{\rm P}\simeq 0.1-500$ eV, in agreement with Swampland expectations. Two large hidden dimensions only felt by the $\nu_R$ sector arise at the same scale, while the string scale is around $M_s\simeq g_\nu M_{\rm P}\simeq 10-700$ TeV. Some phenomenological implications and model building challenges are described. As a byproduct, independently of the neutrino issue, we argue that a single large dimension in the context of SM-like type IIA Calabi--Yau orientifolds leads to too small Yukawa couplings for quarks and charged leptons.</description>

Abstract: We construct off-shell vertex operators for the bosonic spinning particle. Using the language of homotopy algebras, we show that the full nonlinear structure of Yang-Mills theory, including its gauge transformations, is encoded in the commutator algebra of the worldline vertex operators. To do so, we deform the worldline BRST operator by coupling it to a background gauge field and show that the coupling is consistent on a suitable truncation of the Hilbert space. On this subspace, the square of the BRST operator is proportional to the Yang-Mills field equations, which we interpret as an operator Maurer-Cartan equation for the background. This allows us to define further vertex operators in different ghost numbers, which correspond to the entire $L_\infty$ algebra of Yang-Mills theory. Besides providing a precise map of a fully nonlinear field theory into a worldline model, we expect these results will be valuable to investigate the kinematic algebra of Yang-Mills, which is central to the double copy program.</description>

Abstract: The cosmological horizon has an associated entropy suggesting that it might encode a quantum mechanical system on its surface. This has motivated extending the principles of the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space/ conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence to static patch holography. Some of our understanding of the AdS/CFT holography has been catalyzed by exploring the geometric duals to quantum information observables in the CFT side of the correspondence. In particular, holographic complexity captures the evolution of the black hole interior, which is conjectured to be dual to a measure of the difficulty in preparing a quantum circuit on the CFT side. Motivated by these developments, we will propose complexity observables defined in geometric terms for an asymptotically dS spacetime and its putative quantum mechanical dual system. To sharply define complexity observables in the static patch of dS space, they will be anchored to a time-like Dirichlet surface where the dual theory is located, called the stretched horizon. While static patch holography needs much more development in order to reach a level of understanding of the likes of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we hope that the work reported in this thesis allows for crucial steps in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12005v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from the surroundings of these pulsars. We used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTAO, which is now under development. Furthermore, the particle propagation throughout the Galaxy was simulated using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. The findings suggest that CTAO may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Extremely small stars in scalar-tensor gravity: when stellar radius is less than Schwarzschild one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show analytically that there exist compact stellar objects akin to neutron stars whose radius is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius defined by Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass. The radius of the compact object is defined by the radius where the energy density and the pressure of ordinary matter vanish, while clouds of scalar(s) can extend beyond this radius -- a situation that is often encountered in modified gravity theories, like $F(R)$ gravity and the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The clouds of scalar mode(s) give additional contributions to the ADM mass and as a result, the corresponding Schwarzschild radius given by the ADM mass can be larger than that of the compact object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we delve into the model of the shift symmetric and parity-preserving Beyond Horndeski theory in all its generality. We present an explicit algorithm to extract static and spherically symmetric black holes with primary scalar charge adhering to the conservation of the Noether current emanating from the shift symmetry. We show that when the functionals $G_2$ and $G_4$ of the theory are linearly dependent, analytic homogeneous black-hole solutions exist, which can become regular by virtue of the primary charge contribution. Such geometries can easily enjoy the preservation of the Weak Energy Conditions, elevating them into healthier compact objects than most hairy black holes in modified theories of gravity. Finally, we revisit the concept of disformal transformations as a solution-generating mechanism and discuss the case of generic $G_2$ and $G_4$ functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As shown in the classic work of Belinski, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz, the approach to a generic space-like singularity in general relativity consists of a sequence of eras and epochs in which the metric is locally Kasner, connected by brief transitions. When quantum gravity effects are included, we argue that a new type of transition arises, giving rise to Kasner eons: periods which are dominated by emergent physics at each energy scale. We comment on the different ways in which the Einsteinian eon may come to an end and show explicitly how additional Kasner eons arise in the interior of a black hole solution due to higher-derivative corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous and anisotropic evolution of Bianchi type-I spacetime driven by perfect fluid with shear viscosity. We obtain exact solutions by considering the simplest form of the equation of state wherein the pressure and the shear stress are proportional to the energy density individually. A special case of our general solutions represent Bianchi type-VII cosmology. We analyse the singularity structure of the solutions and its connection with various energy conditions. We find that the initial singularity can be removed only for the Bianchi type-VII. We also analyse the late-time behaviour of the solutions and find that, compared to the usual Friedmann universe, the spacetime expands less rapidly and the energy density drops faster.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on future rip scenarios with holographic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>

      <title>Small Instanton Effects on Composite Axion Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of small instanton effects on the axion mass in composite axion models. In particular, we focus on the Composite Accidental Axion (CAA) models, which are designed to address the axion quality problem, and where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry emerges accidentally. In the CAA models, the QCD gauge symmetry is embedded in a larger gauge group at high energy. These models contain small instantons not included in low-energy QCD, which could enhance the axion mass significantly. However, in the CAA models, our analysis reveals that these effects on the axion mass are non-vanishing but are negligible compared to the QCD effects. The suppression of the small instanton effects originates from the global chiral U(1) symmetries which are not broken spontaneously and play a crucial role in eliminating $\theta$-terms in the hidden sectors through anomalies. We find these U(1) symmetries restrict the impact of small instantons in hidden sectors on the axion mass. Our study provides crucial insights into the dynamics within the CAA models and suggests broader implications for understanding small instanton effects in other composite axion models.</description>

      <title>Quintom cosmology and modified gravity after DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.</description>

      <title>Vacuum structure of an eight-dimensional $SU(3)$ gauge theory on a magnetized torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum structure of an eight-dimensional non-abelian gauge theory with a compactified four-dimensional torus as the extra dimensions. As a non-trivial background configuration of the gauge field of an $SU(n)$ gauge group, we suppose a magnetic flux in two extra dimensions, and continuous Wilson line phases are also involved. We introduce matter fields and calculate the mass spectrum of low-energy modes appearing in a four-dimensional effective theory in an $SU(3)$ model as an explicit example. As expected, potentially tachyonic states in four-dimensional modes appear from extra-dimensional gauge fields that couple to the flux background since the gauge group is simply connected. The Wilson line phases give a non-vanishing contribution to their masses, and we have a low-energy mass spectrum without tachyonic states, given that these phases take an appropriate value. To verify the validity of the values of the Wilson line phases, we examine the one-loop effective potential for these phases and explicitly show the contribution from each type of field present in our model. It is clarified that, although there seems to be no local minimum in the potential for the Wilson line phases in the pure Yang-Mills case, by including matter fields, we could find a vacuum configuration where tachyonic states disappear.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in magnetized black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Comisso-Asenjo mechanism is a novel mechanism proposed recently to extract energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection of the surrounding charged plasma, in which the magnetic field plays a crucial role. In this work, we revisit this process by taking into account the backreaction of the magnetic field on the black hole's geometry. We employ the Kerr-Melvin metric to describe the local near-horizon geometry of the magnetized black hole. By analyzing the circular orbits in the equatorial plane, energy extraction conditions, power and efficiency of the energy extraction, we found that while a stronger magnetic field can enhance plasma magnetization and aid energy extraction, its backreaction on the spacetime may hinder the process, with a larger magnetic field posing a greater obstacle. Balancing these effects, an optimal moderate magnetic field strength is found to be most conducive to energy extraction. Moreover, there is a maximum limit to the magnetic field strength associated with the black hole's spin, beyond which circular orbits in the equatorial plane are prohibited, thereby impeding energy extraction in the current scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism of non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry is developed, and the Yukawa couplings are level $N$ polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms satisfying the Laplacian condition. We find that the integer (even) weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of level $N$ can be decomposed into multiplets of the finite modular group $\Gamma'_N$ ($\Gamma_N$). The original modular invariance approach is extended by the presence of negative weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms. The non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry can be consistently combined with the generalized CP symmetry. We present three example models for lepton sector based on the $\Gamma_3\cong A_4$ modular symmetry, the charged lepton masses and the neutrino oscillation data can be accommodated very well, and the predictions for the leptonic CP violation phases and the effective Majorana neutrino mass are studied.</description>

      <title>Cosmological particle production in a quantum field simulator as a quantum mechanical scattering problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>

      <title>Generalized Chern-Pontryagin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $f(R, {}^*RR)$. Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for a particular model, $f(R, {}^*RR)=R+\beta ({}^*RR)^2$, considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating metric and first-order perturbations of G\"{o}del-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameter $L$, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, G\"{o}del-type metrics hold unperturbed. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields: $\Phi$, a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second, $\vartheta$, a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field $\vartheta$ emerges coupled with the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $\vartheta {}^*RR$, which is nothing more than Chern-Simons term.</description>
