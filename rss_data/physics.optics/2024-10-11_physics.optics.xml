      <title>Symmetry-Protected Lossless Modes in Dispersive Time-Varying Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an exact application of a recently developed, operator-based theory of wave propagation in dispersive, time-varying media. Using this theory we find that the usual symmetry of complex conjugation plus changing the sign of the frequency, required for real valued fields, implies that the allowed propagation constants in the medium are either real valued or come in conjugate pairs. The real valued wave numbers are only present in time-varying media, implying that time variation leads to modes that are free from dissipation, even in a lossy medium. Moreover, these symmetry-unbroken waves lack a defined propagation direction. This can lead to a divergent transmission coefficient when waves are incident onto a finite, time-varying slab. The techniques used in this work present a route towards further analytic applications of this operator formalism.</description>

      <title>Control of chirality and directionality of nonlinear metasurface light source via twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have revolutionized nonlinear and quantum light manipulation in the past decade, enabling the design of materials that can tune polarization, frequency, and direction of light simultaneously. However, tuning of metasurfaces is traditionally achieved by changing their microscopic structure, which does not allow \emph{in situ} tuning and dynamic optimization of the metasurfaces. In this Letter, we explore the concept of twisted bilayer and tetralayer nonlinear metasurfaces, which offer rich tunability in its effective nonlinear susceptibilities. Using gold-based metasurfaces, we demonstrate that a number of different singularities of nonlinear susceptibilities can exist in the parameter space of twist angle and interlayer gap between different twisted layers. At the singularities, reflected/transmitted light from the nonlinear process (such as second-harmonic generation) can either become circularly polarized (for C points), or entirely vanish (for V points). By further breaking symmetries of the system, we can independently tune all aspects of the reflected and transmitted nonlinear emission, achieving unidirectional emission with full-Poincar\'e polarization tunability, a dark state (V-V point), or any other bidirectional output. Our work paves the way for multidimensional control of polarization and directionality in nonlinear light sources, opening new avenues in ultrafast optics, optical communication, sensing, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Real-Time Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging: Multi-Pixel Parallelism for FPGA-Accelerated Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is a widely used technique in the biomedical field for measuring the decay times of fluorescent molecules, providing insights into metabolic states, protein interactions, and ligand-receptor bindings. However, its broader application in fast biological processes, such as dynamic activity monitoring, and clinical use, such as in guided surgery, is limited by long data acquisition times and computationally demanding data processing. While deep learning has reduced post-processing times, time-resolved data acquisition remains a bottleneck for real-time applications. To address this, we propose a method to achieve real-time FLI using an FPGA-based hardware accelerator. Specifically, we implemented a GRU-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model on an FPGA board compatible with time-resolved cameras. The GRU model balances accurate processing with the resource constraints of FPGAs, which have limited DSP units and BRAM. The limited memory and computational resources on the FPGA require efficient scheduling of operations and memory allocation to deploy deep learning models for low-latency applications. We address these challenges by using STOMP, a queue-based discrete-event simulator that automates and optimizes task scheduling and memory management on hardware. By integrating a GRU-based Seq2Seq model and its compressed version, called Seq2SeqLite, generated through knowledge distillation, we were able to process multiple pixels in parallel, reducing latency compared to sequential processing. We explore various levels of parallelism to achieve an optimal balance between performance and resource utilization. Our results indicate that the proposed techniques achieved a 17.7x and 52.0x speedup over manual scheduling for the Seq2Seq model and the Seq2SeqLite model, respectively.</description>

      <title>Pockels Laser Directly Driving Ultrafast Optical Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The invention of the laser unleashed the potential of optical metrology, leading to numerous advancements in modern science and technology. This reliance on lasers, however, also sets a bottleneck for precision optical metrology which is complicated by sophisticated photonic infrastructure required for delicate laser-wave control, leading to limited metrology performance and significant system complexity. Here we make a key step towards resolving this challenge, by demonstrating a Pockels laser with multi-functional capability that advances the optical metrology to a new level. The chip-scale laser exhibits a narrow intrinsic linewidth down to 167 Hz and a broad mode-hop-free tuning range up to 24 GHz. In particular, it offers an unprecedented frequency chirping rate up to 20 EHz/s, and an enormous modulation bandwidth &gt;10 GHz, both orders of magnitude larger than any existing lasers. With this laser, we are able to successfully achieve velocimetry of 40 m/s at a short distance of 0.4 m, with a measurable velocity up to the first cosmic velocity at 1 m away, that is inaccessible by conventional ranging approaches, and distance metrology with a ranging resolution of &lt;2 cm. Moreover, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we are able to realize a dramatically simplified architecture for laser frequency stabilization, by direct locking the laser to an external reference gas cell without any extra external light control. We successfully achieve a long-term laser stability with a frequency fluctuation of only $\pm$ 6.5 MHz over 60 minutes. The demonstrated Pockels laser combines elegantly high laser coherence with ultrafast frequency reconfigurability and superior multifunctional capability that we envision to have profound impacts on many areas including communication, sensing, autonomous driving, quantum information processing, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Edge-guided inverse design of digital metamaterials for ultra-high-capacity on-chip multi-dimensional interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating demands of compute-intensive applications, including artificial intelligence, urgently necessitate the adoption of sophisticated optical on-chip interconnect technologies to overcome critical bottlenecks in scaling future computing systems. This transition requires leveraging the inherent parallelism of wavelength and mode dimensions of light, complemented by high-order modulation formats, to significantly enhance data throughput. Here we experimentally demonstrate a novel synergy of these three dimensions, achieving multi-tens-of-terabits-per-second on-chip interconnects using ultra-broadband, multi-mode digital metamaterials. Employing a highly efficient edge-guided analog-and-digital optimization method, we inversely design foundry-compatible, robust, and multi-port digital metamaterials with an 8xhigher computational efficiency. Using a packaged five-mode multiplexing chip, we demonstrate a single-wavelength interconnect capacity of 1.62 Tbit s-1 and a record-setting multi-dimensional interconnect capacity of 38.2 Tbit s-1 across 5 modes and 88 wavelength channels. A theoretical analysis suggests that further system optimization can enable on-chip interconnects to reach sub-petabit-per-second data transmission rates. This study highlights the transformative potential of optical interconnect technologies to surmount the constraints of electronic links, thus setting the stage for next-generation datacenter and optical compute interconnects.</description>

      <title>All-optical in vivo photoacoustic tomography by adaptive multilayer temporal backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) offers high optical contrast with acoustic imaging depth, making it essential for biomedical applications. While many all-optical systems have been developed to address limitations of ultrasound transducers, such as limited spatial sampling and optical path obstructions, measuring surface displacements on rough and dynamic tissues remains challenging. Existing methods often lack sensitivity for in vivo imaging or are complex and time-consuming. Here, we present an all-optical PAT system that enables fast, high-resolution volumetric imaging in live tissues. Using full-field holographic microscopy combined with a soft cover layer and coherent averaging, the system maps surface displacements over a 10 mm*10 mm area with 0.5 nm sensitivity in 1 second. A temporal backpropagation algorithm reconstructs 3D images from a single pressure map, allowing rapid, depth-selective imaging. With adaptive multilayer backpropagation, the system achieves imaging depths of up to 5 mm, with lateral and axial resolutions of 158 micrometer and 92 micrometer as demonstrated through in vivo imaging of mouse vasculature.</description>

      <title>Widely Tunable Photonic Filter Based on Equivalent Chirped Four-Phase-Shifted Sampled Bragg Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an integrated dual-band photonic filter (PF) utilizing equivalent chirped four-phase-shifted sidewall-sampled Bragg gratings (4PS-SBG) on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Using the reconstruction equivalent-chirp technique, we designed linearly chirped 4PS Bragg gratings with two {\pi}-phase shifts ({\pi}-PS) positioned at 1/3 and 2/3 of the grating cavity, introducing two passbands in the +1st order channel. Leveraging the significant thermo-optic effect of silicon, dual-band tuning is achieved through integrated micro-heaters (MHs) on the chip surface. By varying the injection currents from 0 to 85 mA into the MHs, the device demonstrates continuous and wide-range optical frequency division (OFD) performance, with the frequency interval between the two passbands adjustable from 52.1 GHz to 439.5 GHz. Four notable frequency division setups at 100 GHz, 200 GHz, 300 GHz, and 400 GHz were demonstrated using a 100 GHz, 1535 nm semiconductor passive mode-locked laser as the light source.</description>

      <title>Deep-subwavelength engineering of stealthy hyperuniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light behaviours in disordered materials have been of research interest primarily at length scales beyond or comparable to the wavelength of light, because order and disorder are often believed to be almost indistinguishable in the subwavelength regime according to effective medium theory (EMT). However, it was recently demonstrated that the breakdown of EMT occurs even at deep-subwavelength scales when interface phenomena, such as the Goos-Hanchen effect, dominate light flows. Here we develop the engineering of disordered multilayers at deep-subwavelength scales to achieve angle-selective manipulation of wave localization. To examine the disorder-dependent EMT breakdown, we classify the intermediate regime of microstructural phases between deep-subwavelength crystals and uncorrelated disorder through the concept of stealthy hyperuniformity (SHU). In this classification, we devise nontrivial order-to-disorder transitions by selectively tailoring the short-range and long-range order in SHU multilayers, achieving angle-selective control of wave localization. The result paves the way to the realization of deep-subwavelength disordered metamaterials, bridging the gap between the fields of disordered photonics and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Dipole-Dipole Interactions Enabled with Guided Plasmons of Matched Nanoparticle-on-Mirror Antenna Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruling a wide range of phenomena, dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) are typically constrained to the short range due to their rapid decay with the increasing dipole separations, limiting the performance in long-range applications. By judiciously designing the photonic structures that control the two-point Green's functions of the electromagnetic environment, the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters (luminescence) and their interactions (e.g., F\"orster energy transfer) can be conveniently tuned. In this paper, we designed a matched nanoparticle-on-mirror antenna pair with enhanced DDI guided by surface plasmon polaritons confined to the metal substrate, which ensures concentrated and enhanced interaction over long ranges of tens of wavelengths. The long-range ($\sim 10 \lambda$) DDI between donor-acceptor emitters is enhanced by $6\times 10^{3}$ times respective to bare gold film, and $4.4\times 10^{4}$ times respective to vacuum. Our result provides a promising testbed for investigating long-range DDI phenomena on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Spatial localization of intense laser pulses in hollow cores of ionized nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local field enhancement occurring in laser-nanostructure interaction is of wide interest due to its potential application in nonlinear optics and strong-field physics. Here we demonstrate through particle-in-cell simulations a non-resonant field enhancement in hollow cores of ionized nanotubes. Surface plasmon polariton is excited in ionized nanotubes by the laser pulse, producing a back-scattered longitudinal field. This field interferes with the incoming field, and the phase shift of two fields induces an axial converging energy flow. The resulting concentrated energy is coupled into the waveguide formed by the tubular plasma and propagates with a reasonable loss. The field enhancement is sensitive to the inner radius and survives for a range of plasma densities. This enhanced field is almost homogeneous in a nanometer-sized volume and may facilitate high-field measurement with subwavelength spatial resolution.</description>

Abstract: Achieving fast, large-scale volumetric imaging with micrometer resolution has been a persistent challenge in the field of biological microscopy. To address this challenge, we report an augmented version of light field microscopy, incorporating a motorized tilting mirror upstream the camera. Depending on the scanning pattern, the field of view and/or the lateral resolution can be greatly improved. Our microscope technique is simple, versatile and configured for both bright-field and epifluorescence modes. We demonstrate its performances with imaging of multi-cellular aggregates of various shape and sizes.</description>

      <title>Considerations for Electromagnetic Simulations for a Quantitative Correlation of Optical Spectroscopy and Electron Tomography of Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical cross sections of plasmonic nanoparticles are intricately linked to the morphology of the particle. If this connection can be made accurately enough, it would become possible to determine a particles shape solely from its measured optical cross sections. For that, electromagnetic simulations can be used to bridge the morphology and optical properties assuming that they can be performed in an accurate manner. In this paper, we study key factors that influence the accuracy of electromagnetic simulations. First, we compare several standard electromagnetic simulation methods and discuss in detail the effects of the meshing accuracy, choice of dielectric function and inclusion of a substrate for the boundary element method. To help the boundary element methods complex parametrization, we develop a workflow including reconstruction, meshing and mesh simplification steps to be able to use electron tomography data as input for these simulations. In particular, we analyze how the choice of reconstruction algorithm and the intricacies of image segmentation influence the simulated optical cross sections and correlate it to induced shape errors, which can be minimized in the data processing pipeline. In our case, optimal results could be obtained by using the Total Variation Minimization (TVM) reconstruction method in combination with Otsu thresholding and slight smoothing, which was important to create a reliable and watertight surface mesh using the marching cubes algorithm, especially for more complex shapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brief overview of the current state of the problem of electromagnetic field singularities arising from the refraction and scattering of light by material objects is given. The discussion begins with caustics arising from ray tracing in geometric optics and consistently moves toward increasing the accuracy of consideration and decreasing the scale, ending with a description of singularities in light scattering by subwavelength particles. Common and distinctive features of various types of singularities, the role of the symmetry of the problem and the law of conservation of energy are revealed. Physical foundations and methods for overcoming the diffraction limit are discussed. The theoretical description is illustrated by experimental examples. Various practical applications of the effects under consideration are indicated.</description>

Abstract: Yb:KGW lasers have been gaining increasing importance in ultrafast and strong-field physics, but their compression to the single- and sub- cycle regime remains a challenge. Here, we utilized a dual hollow-core fiber module for the spectral broadening of Yb:KGW pulses to more than 3.5 optical octaves, from the short-wave infrared (~1900 nm) to vacuum ultraviolet (~170 nm). A light-field-synthesizer compressed a large portion of this bandwidth (380-1000 nm) to single-cycle pulses for the first time, based on Yb:KGW technology. Our work opens the door to attaining new regimes of control and temporal compression of light pulses and their advanced applications in ultrafast spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Extreme events and power-law distributions from nonlinear quantum dissipation</title>

Abstract: Power-law probability distributions are widely used to model extreme statistical events in complex systems, with applications to a vast array of natural phenomena ranging from earthquakes to stock market crashes to pandemics. We propose the emergence of power-law distributions as a generic feature of quantum systems with strong nonlinear dissipation. We introduce a prototypical family of quantum dynamical systems with nonlinear dissipation, and prove analytically the emergence of power-law tails in the steady state probability distribution for energy. The power law physically originates from the amplification of quantum noise, where the scale of the microscopic fluctuations grows with the energy of the system. Our model predicts a power-law regime with infinite mean energy, which manifests as extreme events and divergences in the measurement statistics. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of power-law distributions for a general class of nonlinear dynamics known as quantum Li\'enard systems. This phenomenon can be potentially harnessed to develop extreme photon sources for novel applications in light-matter interaction and sensing.</description>

      <title>Formalism to Image the Dynamics of Coherent and Incoherent Phonon with Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy using Kinematic Diffraction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) is a novel X-ray imaging technique developed at synchrotrons to image along the diffracted beam with a real space resolution of ~100 nm and reciprocal space resolution of $10^{-4}$. Recent implementations of DFXM at X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have demonstrated DFXM's ability to visualize the real-time evolution of coherent GHz phonons produced by ultrafast laser excitation of metal transducers. Combining this with DFXM's ability to visualize strain fields due to dislocations makes it possible to study the interaction of GHz coherent phonons with the strain fields of dislocations, along with studying the damping of coherent phonons due to interactions with thermal phonons. For quantitative analysis of phonon-dislocation interactions and phonon damping, a formalism is required to relate phonon dynamics to the strains measured by DFXM. In this work, we use kinematic diffraction theory to simulate DFXM images of the specific coherent phonons in diamond that are generated by the ultrafast laser excitation of a metal transducer. We extend this formalism to also describe imaging of incoherent phonons of sufficiently high frequency, which are relevant for thermal transport, offering future opportunities for DFXM to image signals produced by thermal diffuse scattering. For both coherent and incoherent phonons, we discuss the optimal sampling of real space, reciprocal space and time, and the opportunities offered by the advances in DFXM optics.</description>

      <title>Tunable second harmonic generation in 2D materials: comparison of different strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical frequency conversion, where optical fields interact with a nonlinear medium to generate new frequencies, is a key phenomenon in modern photonic systems. However, a major challenge with these techniques lies on the difficulty of tuning the nonlinear electrical susceptibilities that drive such effects in a given material. As a result, dynamic control of optical nonlinearities has remained largely confined to research laboratories, limiting its practical use as a spectroscopic tool. In this work, we aim to advance the development of devices with tunable nonlinear responses by exploring two potential mechanisms for electrically manipulating second-order optical nonlinearity in two-dimensional materials. Specifically, we consider two configurations: in the first, the material does not inherently exhibit second-harmonic generation (SHG), but this response is induced by an external field; in the second, an external field induces doping in a material that already exhibits SHG, altering the intensity of the nonlinear signal. These two approaches are investigated and compared with existing experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a compelling platform for both classical and quantum technologies. In particular, the past decade has witnessed a surge of novel ideas and developments, which may be overwhelming for newcomers to the field. This review provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and key applications of hBN, including quantum sensing, quantum key distribution, quantum computing, and quantum memory. Additionally, we highlight critical experimental and theoretical advances that have expanded the capabilities of hBN, in a cohesive and accessible manner. The objective is to equip readers with a comprehensive understanding of the diverse applications of hBN, and provide insights into ongoing research efforts.</description>

      <title>Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color laser driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we unifiedly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense laser (non-perturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the spatial symmetry of the laser-field trajectory. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zero-th order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift or injection current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multiple-color laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Non-utopian optical properties computed of a tomographically reconstructed real photonic nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art computational methods combined with common idealized structural models provide an incomplete understanding of experiments on real nanostructures, since manufacturing introduces unavoidable deviations from the design. We propose to close this knowledge gap by using the real structure of a manufactured crystal as input in computations to obtain a realistic comparison with observations on the same nanostructure. We demonstrate this approach on the structure of a real silicon inverse woodpile photonic bandgap crystal, obtained by previous synchrotron X-ray imaging. A 2D part of the dataset is selected and processed into a computational mesh suitable for a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DGFEM) to compute optical transmission spectra that are compared to those of a utopian crystal, i.e., a hypothetical model crystal with the same filling fraction where all pores are identical and circular. The nanopore shapes in the real crystal differ in a complex way from utopian pores, leading to a complex transmission spectrum with significant frequency speckle in and beyond the gap. The utopian model provides only a limited understanding of the spectrum: while it accurately predicts low frequency finite-size fringes and the lower band edge, the upper band edge is off, it completely misses the presence of speckle, the domination of speckle above the gap, and possible Anderson localized states in the gap. Moreover, unlike experiments where only external probes are available, numerical methods allow to study all fields everywhere. While the pore shapes hardly affect the fields at low frequency, major differences occur at high frequency such as localized fields deep inside the real crystal. In summary, using only external measurements and utopian models may give an erroneous picture of the fields and the LDOS inside a real crystal, which is remedied by our new approach.</description>

      <title>Designing metasurface optical interfaces for solid-state qubits using many-body adjoint shape optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general strategy for the inverse design of metasurfaces composed of elementary shapes. We use it to design a structure that collects and collimates light from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Such metasurfaces constitute scalable optical interfaces for solid-state qubits, enabling efficient photon coupling into optical fibers and eliminating free-space collection optics. The many-body shape optimization strategy is a practical alternative to topology optimization that explicitly enforces material and fabrication constraints throughout the optimization, while still achieving high performance. The metasurface is easily adaptable to other solid-state qubits, and the optimization method is broadly applicable to fabrication-constrained photonic design problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize a method using frequency combs to construct waves that feature superoscillations - local regions of the wave that exhibit a change in phase that the bandlimits of the wave should not otherwise allow. This method has been shown to create superoscillating regions that mimic any analytic function - even ones well outside the bandlimits - to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. We experimentally demonstrate that these waves are extremely robust against noise, allowing for accurate reconstruction of a superoscillating target function thoroughly buried in noise. We additionally show that such a construction can be easily used to range-resolve a signal well below the commonly accepted fundamental limit.</description>

      <title>Imaging coupled vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics triggered by interaction with light often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Characterizing the resulting coupled electronic and nuclear wave packet motion represents a severe challenge, even for small polyatomic systems. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) in combination with quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the role of the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. A conical intersection between these states couples the bending and asymmetric stretching coordinates, which is clearly reflected in the correlated fragment momenta. Our results suggest that multi-coincident CEI represents an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Towards simultaneous imaging of ultrafast nuclear and electronic dynamics in small molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a chemical bond is broken, the molecular structure undergoes a transformation. An ideal experiment should probe the change in the electronic and nuclear structure simultaneously. Here, we present a method for the simultaneous time-resolved imaging of nuclear and electron dynamics by combining Coulomb explosion imaging with strong-field photoelectron momentum imaging. The simplest chemical reaction, H$_2^+$ $\rightarrow$ H$^+ +$ H, is probed experimentally for the delay-dependent kinetic energy release, and numerically for the transient change in the photoelectron spectra during the dissociation process. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the fixed-nuclei approximation numerically and the results are compared to those from a simple imaging model. The numerical results reflect the evolution in the electron density in the molecular ion as its bond is first stretched and then brakes apart. Our work shows how simple gas-phase chemical dynamics can be captured in complete molecular movies.</description>
