      <title>High-Significance Detection of Correlation Between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and the Large Scale Cosmic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the $\gamma$-ray sky has improved dramatically in the past decade, however, the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background (UGRB) still has a potential wealth of information about the faintest $\gamma$-ray sources pervading the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations with tracers of cosmic structure can indirectly identify the populations that most characterize the $\gamma$-ray background. In this study, we analyze the angular correlation between the $\gamma$-ray background and the matter distribution in the Universe as traced by gravitational lensing, leveraging more than a decade of observations from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) and 3 years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We detect a correlation at signal-to-noise ratio of 8.9. Most of the statistical significance comes from large scales, demonstrating, for the first time, that a substantial portion of the UGRB aligns with the mass clustering of the Universe as traced by weak lensing. Blazars provide a plausible explanation for this signal, especially if those contributing to the correlation reside in halos of large mass ($\sim 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) and account for approximately 30-40 % of the UGRB above 10 GeV. Additionally, we observe a preference for a curved $\gamma$-ray energy spectrum, with a log-parabolic shape being favored over a power-law. We also discuss the possibility of modifications to the blazar model and the inclusion of additional $gamma$-ray sources, such as star-forming galaxies or particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Selecting samples of galaxies with fewer Fingers-of-God</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radial positions of galaxies inferred from their measured redshift appear distorted due to their peculiar velocities. We argue that the contribution from stochastic velocities -- which gives rise to `Fingers-of-God' (FoG) anisotropy in the inferred maps -- does not lend itself to perturbative modelling already on scales targeted by current experiments. To get around this limitation, we propose to remove FoG using data-driven indicators of their abundance that are local in nature and thus avoid selection biases. In particular, we show that the scale where the measured power spectrum quadrupole changes sign is tightly anti-correlated with both the satellite fraction and the velocity dispersion, and can thus be used to select galaxy samples with fewer FoG. In addition, we show that maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich distortion of the cosmic microwave background frequency spectrum can be used to identify and discard many of the most problematic galaxies. These techniques could potentially extend the reach of perturbative models for galaxy clustering and improve reconstructions of the large-scale velocity and displacement fields from the redshift-space positions of galaxies.</description>

      <title>CWTHF: Identifying Dark Matter Halos with Continuous Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are an important method for investigating the evolution of the Universe. In order to gain further insight into the processes of structure formation, it is necessary to identify isolated bound objects within the simulations, namely, the dark matter halos. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is an effective tool used as a halo finder due to its ability to extract clustering information from the input data. In this study, we introduce CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder), the first wavelet-based, MPI-parallelized halo finder, marking a novel approach in the field of cosmology. We calculate the CWT from the cloud-in-cell (CIC) grid and segment the grid based on the local CWT maxima. We then investigate the effects of the parameters that influence our program and identify the default settings. A comparison with the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) method demonstrates the viability of CWT for halo finding. Although the actual performance is not faster than FOF, the linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ of our identification scheme indicates its significant potential for future optimization and application.</description>

      <title>Studying the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations using photometric redshifts from the DESI Legacy Imaging survey DR9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR9, with its extensive dataset of galaxy locations and photometric redshifts, presents an opportunity to study Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the region covered by the ongoing DESI spectroscopic survey.
  Aims. We aim to investigate differences between different parts of the DR9 footprint. Furthermore, we want to measure the BAO scale for luminous red galaxies within them. Our selected redshift range of 0.6 to 0.8 corresponds to the bin in which a tension between DESI Y1 and eBOSS was found.
  Methods. We calculated the anisotropic two-point correlation function in a modified binning scheme to detect the BAO in DR9 data. We then use template fits based on simulations to measure the BAO scale in the imaging data.
  Results. Our analysis revealed the expected correlation function shape in most of the footprint areas, showing a BAO scale consistent with Planck's observations. Aside from identified mask-related data issues in the southern region of the South Galactic Cap, we also find a notable variance between the different footprints.
  Conclusions. We find that this variance is consistent with the difference between the DESI Y1 and eBOSS data and it supports the argument that that tension is caused by sample variance. Additionally, we also uncovered systematic biases not previously accounted for in photometric BAO studies. We emphasize the necessity of adjusting for the systematic shift in the BAO scale associated with typical photometric redshift uncertainties to ensure accurate measurements.</description>

      <title>Cosmological search for sterile neutrinos after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether the massive sterile neutrinos exist remains a crucial unresolved issue in both particle physics and cosmology. We explore the cosmological constraints on the massive sterile neutrinos using the latest observational data, including the baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, the cosmic microwave background data from Planck satellite and ACT, and the 5-year Type Ia supernova data and the 3-year weak-lensing data from DES. We search for the massive sterile neutrinos within the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our analysis shows that when considering massive sterile neutrinos within the $w_0w_a\rm CDM$ model, the combined datasets allow us to infer a non-zero sterile neutrino mass at approximately $2\sigma$ confidence level. Specifically, in the $w_0w_a$CDM+Sterile model, the effective mass of sterile neutrinos and the effective number of relativistic species are constrained to be $m_{\nu,\ \mathrm{sterile}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = 0.50^{+0.33}_{-0.27} \, \mathrm{eV}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff} = 3.076^{+0.011}_{-0.017}$, respectively. However, the $\Lambda$CDM+Sterile and $w$CDM+Sterile models could not provide evidence supporting the existence of massive sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Explaining JWST star formation history at $z \sim 17$ by modifying $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations indicate a $5\sigma$ discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ derived from late and early universe probes. A further possible tension at the $\sim 3\sigma$ level arises from different measurements of $\sigma_8$. These measurements suggest the existence of new physics. Here, we explore several theories of modified gravity that may help to resolve these cosmological tensions. These include a family of phenomenological modified theories, where only Newton's gravitational constant and the Einstein-Boltzmann equations are affected. We consider one particular class of these theories: cosmologies with varying growth index $\gamma$ and varying dark energy Equation of State (EoS) $w_\Lambda$. We also consider the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model as well as $k$-mouflage gravity, which involves a non-trivially coupled scalar field. Our main aim is to narrow down the modified gravity landscape by constraining each model using high-redshift JWST data. Several probes are considered in this work: Stellar Mass Function (SMF), Stellar Mass Density (SMD), Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) and Ultra-Violet Luminosity Function (UVLF) along with the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that generally, the choice of $r_c\gtrsim 10^{3.5}$ Mpc is preferred for nDGP, while $\beta\sim0.1$, $K_0\gtrsim 0.9$ is favored for $k$-mouflage. Moreover, in the context of phenomenological gravity, phantom-like dark energy EoS $w_\Lambda\lesssim -1$ is preferred over the quintessence.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Curvature Perturbations via Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict an enhancement of scalar perturbations at scales currently unconstrained by cosmological probes. These perturbations source gravitational waves (GWs) at second order in perturbation theory, leading to a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background. The LISA detector, sensitive to mHz GWs, will be able to constrain curvature perturbations in a new window corresponding to scales $k \in [10^{10}, 10^{14}] \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, difficult to probe otherwise. In this work, we forecast the capabilities of LISA to constrain the source of SIGWs using different approaches: i) agnostic, where the spectrum of curvature perturbations is binned in frequency space; ii) template-based, modeling the curvature power spectrum based on motivated classes of models; iii) ab initio, starting from first-principles model of inflation featuring an ultra-slow roll phase. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations. Finally, we propose simple tests to assess whether the signal is compatible with the SIGW hypothesis. The pipeline used is built into the SIGWAY code.</description>

      <title>Illustrating the consequences of a misuse of $\sigma_8$ in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter $\sigma_8$ represents the root-mean-square (rms) mass fluctuations on a scale of $R_8=8h^{-1}$ Mpc and is commonly used to quantify the amplitude of matter fluctuations at linear cosmological scales. However, the dependence of $R_8$ on $h$ complicates direct comparisons of $\sigma_8$ values obtained under different assumptions about $H_0$, since $\sigma_8$ in such cases characterizes the amount of structure at different physical scales. This issue arises both when comparing $\sigma_8$ values from fitting analyses of cosmological models with differing $H_0$ posteriors, and when contrasting constraints from experiments with different priors on $H_0$. As first noted by Ariel G. S\'anchez in PRD 102, 123511 (2020), quantifying the growth tension using $\sigma_8$ can introduce substantial biases and couple the growth and Hubble tensions in an intricate way. To address these challenges, S\'anchez proposed an alternative parameter, $\sigma_{12}$, defined as the rms mass fluctuations at a scale of $12$ Mpc, which is independent of $h$. Although S\'anchez's work was published five years ago and other authors have since highlighted the limitations of $\sigma_8$, much of the cosmological community -- including large collaborations -- continues to rely on this parameter instead of adopting $\sigma_{12}$, seemingly due only to historical considerations. In this work, we illustrate the biases introduced by the use of $\sigma_8$ through some clear examples, aiming to motivate the community to transition from $\sigma_8$ to $\sigma_{12}$. We show that the bias found in models with large values of $H_0$ is more prominent, artificially complicating the search for a model that can resolve the Hubble tension without exacerbating the growth tension. We argue that the worsening of the growth tension in these models is much less pronounced than previously thought or may even be nonexistent.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Large-Scale Structure Formation from Newtonian Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the cosmic non-linear density-fluctuation power spectrum based on the analytical formalism developed in [1] which allows us to study cosmic structure formation based on Newtonian particle dynamics in phase-space. This framework provides a field-theory approach to a perturbative solution of the BBGKY-hierarchy where the resulting loop-expansion of the theory introduces a natural truncation criterion. We show that we are able to reproduce structure growth on large scales $k \leq 0.2 \mathrm{h}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to very high precision while on small and intermediate scales we find deviations of the order of $10\%$ from current numerical simulations. The results strongly suggest that a significant improvement may be achieved by restructuring the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>A New Master Supernovae Ia sample and the investigation of the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11772v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cosmological research still thoroughly debates the discrepancy between local probes and the Cosmic Microwave Background observations in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements, ranging from $4\sigma$ to $6\sigma$. In the current study we examine this tension using the Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data from the Pantheon, PantheonPlus, Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), and Dark Energy Survey (DES) catalogs together with their combination called Master Sample containing 3789 SNe Ia, and dividing all of them into redshift-ordered bins. Two main binning techniques are presented: the equipopulation and the equispace in the $\log\, z$. We perform a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) for each bin to determine the $H_0$ value, estimating it within the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM and the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. These $H_0$ values are then fitted with the following phenomenological function: $\mathcal{H}_0(z) = \tilde{H}_0 / (1 + z)^\alpha$, where $\tilde{H}_0$ is a free parameter representing $\mathcal{H}_0(z)$ fitted at $z=0$, and $\alpha$ is the evolutionary parameter. Our results indicate a decreasing trend characterized by $\alpha \sim 0.01$ whose consistency with zero range from $1.00 \sigma$ at 3 bins in the Pantheon sample with the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model to $\geq 6 \sigma$ at 12 bins with the JLA and DES samples within the $\Lambda$CDM model. Such a trend in the SNe Ia catalogs could be due to evolution with redshift for the SNe Ia astrophysical variables or unveiled selection biases. Alternatively, intrinsic physics, possibly the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, could be responsible for this trend.</description>

      <title>FAST drift scan survey for HI intensity mapping: simulation on Bayesian-stacking-based HI mass function estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of the neutral hydrogen (HI) mass function (HIMF) using a Bayesian stacking approach with simulated data for the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) HI intensity mapping (HIIM) drift-scan surveys. Using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation, we construct HI sky cubes at redshift $z\sim0.1$ and the corresponding optical galaxy catalogs, simulating FAST observations under various survey strategies, including pilot, deep-field, and ultradeep-field surveys. The HIMF is measured for distinct galaxy populations -- classified by optical properties into red, blue, and bluer galaxies -- and injected with systematic effects such as observational noise and flux confusion caused by the FAST beam. The results show that Bayesian stacking significantly enhances HIMF measurements. For red and blue galaxies, the HIMF can be well constrained with pilot surveys, while deeper surveys are required for the bluer galaxy population. Our analysis also reveals that sample variance dominates over observational noise, emphasizing the importance of wide-field surveys to improve constraints. Furthermore, flux confusion shifts the HIMF toward higher masses, which we address using a transfer function for correction. Finally, we explore the effects of intrinsic sample incompleteness and propose a framework to quantify its impact. This work lays the groundwork for future \hiMF studies with FAST HIIM, addressing key challenges and enabling robust analyses of HI content across galaxy populations.</description>

      <title>Prospects for high-resolution probes of galaxy dynamics tracing background cosmology in MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-$N$ galaxy surveys offer unprecedented opportunities to probe weak gravitation in galaxy dynamics that may contain correlations tracing background cosmology. Of particular interest is the potential of finite sensitivities to the background de Sitter scale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $c$ is the velocity of light. At sufficiently large $N$, this is possibly probed by ensemble-averaged ("stacked") rotation curves (RCs) at resolutions on par with present estimates of the Hubble parameter $H_0$. Here, we consider the prospect for studies using the large $N$ Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) at APO survey. In a first and preliminary step, we consider unbiased control of sub-sample size by consistency in the three Position Angles, $\theta$ , from photometry and velocity fields of gas and stars by spectroscopy within $30^\circ$. In sub-samples of size $N=N_i(\theta)$, the scatter in-the-mean $\sigma/\sqrt{N}$ is found to reach one percent levels, differentiated over inclination angle $i$ and $\theta$. In regular propagation of uncertainties, this scatter contributes $\kappa\sigma/\sqrt{N}$ to the standard error in-the-mean to the observable, where $\kappa$ is determined by the choice of observables. As a lower bound to scatter in stacked RCs, MaNGA hereby appears promising for high-resolution analysis of sensitivity to RCs to background cosmology, notably across a sharp $C^0$-transition (van Putten 2018) of Newtonian to anomalous dynamics across $a_{dS}$ and, further out, the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. In turn, these markers provide a novel measurement of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>A Measurement of the Largest-Scale CMB E-mode Polarization with CLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of large-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) E-mode polarization from the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) 90 GHz data. Using 115 det-yr of observations collected through 2024 with a variable-delay polarization modulator, we achieved a polarization sensitivity of $78\,\mathrm{\mu K\,arcmin}$, comparable to Planck at similar frequencies (100 and 143 GHz). The analysis demonstrates effective mitigation of systematic errors and addresses challenges to large-angular-scale power recovery posed by time-domain filtering in maximum-likelihood map-making. A novel implementation of the pixel-space transfer matrix is introduced, which enables efficient filtering simulations and bias correction in the power spectrum using the quadratic cross-spectrum estimator. Overall, we achieved an unbiased time-domain filtering correction to recover the largest angular scale polarization, with the only power deficit, arising from map-making non-linearity, being characterized as less than $3\%$. Through cross-correlation with Planck, we detected the cosmic reionization at $99.4\%$ significance and measured the reionization optical depth $\tau=0.053^{+0.018}_{-0.019}$, marking the first ground-based attempt at such a measurement. At intermediate angular scales ($\ell&gt;30$), our results, both independently and in cross-correlation with Planck, remain fully consistent with Planck's measurements.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the worldwide Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations detected a stochastic gravitational wave(GW) background in the nanohertz range, which may originate from the early universe's inflationary phase. So in this work, we investigated induce GWs in the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet coupling. Consider the scenario of traversing a domain wall in moduli space, we take the coupling coefficient to be an approximately step function. Within suitable parameter regions, the model exhibits de Sitter fixed points, which allows inflation to undergo an ultra-slow-roll phase, which causes the power spectrum to exhibit a peak. Such a peak can induce nanohertz GWs, which provids an explanation for the PTA observational data. Furthermore, we consider the case of multiple domain wall crossings, and adopting a double-step coupling function. In this case, the resulting GW spectrum has two peaks with frequencies around \(10^{-8} \,\text{Hz}\) and \(10^{-2}\,\text{Hz}\), respectively. Which can be observed by the PTA and the space GW detectors simultaneously.Additionally, the reentry of the power spectrum peaks into the horizon leads to the collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs). We calculate the abundance of PBHs and found that the masses is in the range of \(10^{-14} \sim 10^{-13} M_\odot\) and around \(10^{-2} M_\odot\) , which constitute significant components of the current dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Neutrino Statistics from Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of neutrino statistical property on cosmology and the constraints imposed by cosmological data on neutrino statistics. Cosmological data from probes such as Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) radiation and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) are used to constrain the statistical parameter of neutrino. This constraint is closely related to the degeneracy effects among neutrino statistical property, the sum of neutrino masses, and the Hubble constant. Our results show that purely bosonic neutrinos can be ruled out at 95\% confidence level and purely fermionic neutrinos are preferred.</description>

      <title>(H)ALPing the 511 keV line: A thermal DM interpretation of the 511 keV emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework where MeV-scale Dirac Dark Matter annihilates into axion-like particles, providing a natural explanation for the 511 keV gamma-ray line observed in the Galactic Center. The relic abundance is determined by p-wave annihilation into two axion-like particles, while s-wave annihilation into three axion-like particles, decaying into $e^+ e^-$ pairs, accounts for the line intensity. Remarkably, this model, assuming a standard Navarro-Frenk-White profile, reproduces the observed emission morphology, satisfies in-flight annihilation and cosmological bounds, and achieves the correct relic density, offering a compelling resolution to this longstanding anomaly.</description>

      <title>Stellar Stripping and Disruption in Disks around Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Repeating nuclear transients prior to LISA events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are driven together by gas disks in galactic nuclei, then a surrounding nuclear star cluster or in-situ star-formation should deliver stars to the disk plane. Migration through the circumbinary disk will quickly bring stars to the edge of a low-density cavity cleared by the binary, where the stellar orbit becomes trapped and locked with the binary decay. Here we explore the scenario where the trapped stellar orbit decays with the binary until the binary tidally strips the star in a runaway process. For Sun-like stars, this occurs preferentially for $10^4-10^6 M_{\odot}$ SMBHBs, as the SMBHB enters the LISA band. We estimate that the runaway stripping process will generate Eddington-level X-ray flares repeating on hours-to-days timescales and lasting for decades. The flaring timescales and energetics of these circumbinary disk tidal disruption events (CBD-TDEs) match well with the recently discovered Quasi-Periodic Eruptions. However, the inferred rates of the two phenomena are in tension, unless low-mass SMBHB mergers are more common than expected. For less-dense stars, stripping begins earlier in the SMBHB inspiral, has longer repetition times, lasts longer, is dimmer, and can occur for more massive SMBHBs. Wether CBD-TDEs are a known or a yet-undiscovered class of repeating nuclear transients, they could provide a new probe of the elusive SMBH mergers in low mass / dwarf galaxies, which lie in the sweet-spot of the LISA sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Super-critical primordial black hole formation via delayed first-order electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The delay of the first-order electroweak phase transitions (EWPT) may lead to the emergence of baby universes inside wormhole structures due to the large vacuum energy density in false vacuum domains. Observers outside the false vacuum domains observe them as primordial black holes (PBHs), categorized as super-critical PBHs. We specifically investigate the dynamics of PBH formation due to delayed first-order EWPTs by solving the equations of bubble wall dynamics. We numerically confirm that such super-critical PBHs can be formed by the delayed first-order EWPT assuming spherically symmetric false vacuum domains with the thin-wall approximation for its boundary. Our numerical results show that a PBH formation criterion utilizing characteristic timescales is more appropriate than the conventional criterion based on density fluctuations. Employing our numerical results, we update the parameter regions of new physics models which can be explored by current and future constraints on the PBH abundance.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-2 Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors in Millihertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-2 ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is a viable dark matter candidate and it can be constrained using gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this paper, we investigate the detectability of spin-2 ULDM by space-based GW interferometers. By considering a direct coupling between spin-2 ULDM and ordinary matter, we derive the corresponding response functions and sensitivity curves for various time-delay interferometry channels and calculate the optimal sensitivity curves for future millihertz GW detectors. Our results demonstrate that the space-based detectors can place stringent constraints on the coupling constant of spin-2 ULDM, reaching $\alpha \sim 10^{-10}$ around a mass of $m \sim 10^{-17} \rm eV$, surpassing current limits from ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. Thus, the space-based GW detectors can serve as powerful tools not only for detecting GWs but also for probing fundamental properties of ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <title>Third-order spectrum of gravitational waves sourced by an excited scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate for the first time the third-order spectrum of gravitational waves sourced by the amplified scalar field perturbations during inflation using the in-in formalism, and discuss the conditions for the third-order spectrum to be smaller than the second-order one. Assuming an exponential growth of the sub-horizon modes of the scalar field perturbations, we find that the third-order spectrum increases faster than the second-order one as the amplification of the field perturbations increases, and thus the third-order spectrum dominates for detectable gravitational waves, which indicates that the perturbation theory breakdowns.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Rule Out Heavy Tachyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present direct observational constraints on tachyons; particles with group velocity greater than $c$ in vacuum in a Lorentz invariant theory. Since tachyons may have no direct couplings to Standard Model particles, the most robust and model independent constraints come from gravitational effects, especially black holes. We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black holes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy tachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$ degrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \approx 192 \pi \hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the observation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several billion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m &gt; 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. This means there cannot exist any tachyons associated with unification scales or quantum gravity. So while there already exists theoretical reasons to be skeptical of tachyons, our work provides a complementary direct observational constraint.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE: An ultra-faint $\simeq$ 10$^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$ Pop III Galaxy Candidate and First Constraints on the Pop III UV Luminosity Function at $z\simeq6-7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\alpha$ emission (rest-frame EW $2810\pm550$\AA); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope $\beta=-2.34\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H$\beta$&lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\simeq10^{5}M_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $z\sim6-13$ intergalactic medium from JWST spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha damping wings in galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At $z\gtrsim9$ the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions $\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}=0.33^{+0.18}_{-0.27}, 0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.23}$ ($&gt;0.70$ excluding GNz11) at $z \approx 6.5, 9.3$. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density $\log_{10}N_\mathrm{HI}\approx10^{20.8}$ cm$^{-2}$, comparable to $z\sim3$ Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.</description>

      <title>Axion-like-particle dark matter beyond the standard paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are among the most popular candidates that explain the origin of the mysterious dark matter. The most popular ALP production mechanism studied in the literature is the misalignment mechanism, where an ALP field with a quadratic or cosine potential has negligible kinetic energy initially, and it starts oscillating when its mass becomes comparable to the Hubble scale. Recently, there has been an interest in models that go beyond the standard assumptions. These models not only extend the ALP dark matter parameter space, but also provide a rich phenomenology which is absent in the standard scenario. In particular, the ALP fluctuations grow exponentially via parametric resonance and tachyonic instabilities. In this proceeding, we will first demonstrate why the standard paradigm cannot explain dark matter in experimentally interesting parts of the parameter space, and then we will give an overview of the alternative production mechanism with which this issue can be resolved. We will then discuss the exponential growth of the fluctuations in these models. Finally, we will comment on the observational consequences of the exponential growth and show that a sizable region of the ALP parameter space becomes testable even if ALPs have only gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Gravitational Wave Searches above 10 kHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first direct measurement of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened up new avenues to explore our Universe. This white paper outlines the challenges and gains expected in gravitational-wave searches at frequencies above the LIGO/Virgo band. The scarcity of possible astrophysical sources in most of this frequency range provides a unique opportunity to discover physics beyond the Standard Model operating both in the early and late Universe, and we highlight some of the most promising of these sources. We review several detector concepts that have been proposed to take up this challenge, and compare their expected sensitivity with the signal strength predicted in various models. This report is the summary of a series of workshops on the topic of high-frequency gravitational wave detection, held in 2019 (ICTP, Trieste, Italy), 2021 (online) and 2023 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).</description>

Abstract: Supernovae are extreme astrophysical objects that provide unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We study supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion-like particles (ALPs) with an electron-muon coupling. We consider three ALP production channels in the SN core: muon decay, axion bremsstrahlung, and electron-muon coalescence. We find that the electron-muon coalescence channel, which was not considered in previous studies on LFV-ALPs, provides the most stringent constraints on the LFV coupling in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Inverse cascade from helical and nonhelical decaying columnar magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powerful lasers may in future produce magnetic fields that would allow us to study turbulent magnetohydrodynamic inverse cascade behavior. This has so far only been seen in numerical simulations. In the laboratory, however, the produced fields may be highly anisotropic. Here, we present corresponding simulations to show that, during the turbulent decay, such a magnetic field undergoes spontaneous isotropization. As a consequence, we find the decay dynamics to be similar to that in isotropic turbulence. We also find that an initially pointwise nonhelical magnetic field is unstable and develops magnetic helicity fluctuations that can be quantified by the Hosking integral. It is a conserved quantity that characterizes magnetic helicity fluctuations and governs the turbulent decay when the mean magnetic helicity vanishes. As in earlier work, the ratio of the magnetic decay time to the Alfv\'en time is found to be around $50$ in the helical and nonhelical cases. At intermediate times, the ratio can even reach a hundred. This ratio determines the endpoints of cosmological magnetic field evolution.</description>

Abstract: Even though one could already constrain different models in cosmology and Beyond Standard Model physics using CMB data, these models remained unconstrained at shorter wavelength scales, and knowledge of new physics at higher energy scales relied on theoretical assumptions and extrapolations to these scales. Recently, however, we have experienced the advent of gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy, including the outstanding detections by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration over the past decade and the latest searches for Hellings-Downs correlations in pulsar timing data. Ongoing and future gravitational wave collaborations explore different frequency ranges of the gravitational wave spectrum. In these lecture notes, we focus on how we can probe cosmology and Beyond Standard Model physics with primordial gravitational waves. For this purpose, we review the formalism of gravitational waves in General Relativity, introduce stochastic gravitational waves, and derive the Hellings-Downs correlation for pulsar timing array searches. We comment on detection efforts and present some of the most important cosmological sources that could produce a background. Ultimately, one could compare model-dependent gravitational wave density spectra using gravitational wave data from ground-based, space-borne, and pulsar timing array searches. These lecture notes were inspired by the course "Gravitational Waves from the Early Universe" given at the 27th W.E. Heraeus "Saalburg" Summer School 2021 by Valerie Domcke.</description>

      <title>Big Bang in Dipole Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of dipole cosmology framework put forward in \cite{Krishnan:2022qbv}, a beyond FLRW setting that has a preferred direction in the metric which may be associated with a cosmological tilt, a cosmic dipole. In this setup the shear and the tilt can be positive or negative given the dipole direction. We thoroughly analyze evolution of the universe in this setting, particularly focusing on the behaviour near the Big Bang (BB). We first analyze a single fluid model with a generic constant equation of state $w$. While details of the behavior near the BB depends on $w$ and the other initial conditions, we find that when the shear is negative we have a shear dominated BB singularity, whereas for a positive shear we have a much milder singularity, the whimper singularity \cite{Ellis:1974ug}, at which the tilt blows up while curvature invariants remain finite. We then consider dipole $\Lambda$CDM model which besides the shear has two tilt parameters, one for radiation and one for the pressureless matter. For positive (negative) shear we again find whimper (curvature) singularity near the BB. Moreover, when the tilt parameters have opposite signs, the shear can change sign from negative to positive in the course of evolution of the Universe. We show that the relative tilt of the radiation and the matter generically remains sizable at late times.</description>

      <title>Constraining Hot Dark Matter Sub-Species with Weak Lensing and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is well known that the bulk of dark matter (DM) has to be cold, the existence of an additional sub-dominant, hot species remains a valid possibility. In this paper we investigate the potential of the cosmic shear power spectrum to constrain such a mixed (hot plus cold) DM scenario with two additional free parameters, the hot-to-total DM fraction ($f_{\rm hdm}$) and the thermal mass of the hot component ($m_{\rm hdm}$). Running a Bayesian inference analysis for both the Kilo-Degree Survey cosmic shear data (KiDS) as well as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarisation data from Planck, we derive new constraints for the mixed DM scenario. We find a 95 per cent confidence limit of $f_{\rm hdm}&lt;0.08$ for a very hot species of $m_{\rm hdm}\leq20$ eV. This constraint is weakened to $f_{\rm hdm}&lt;0.25$ for $m_{\rm hdm}\leq80$ eV. Scenarios with masses above $m_{\rm hdm}\sim200$ eV remain unconstrained by the data. Next to providing limits, we investigate the potential of mixed DM to address the clustering (or $S_8$) tension between lensing and the CMB. We find a reduction of the 2D ($\Omega_m - S_8$) tension from 2.9$\sigma$ to 1.6$\sigma$ when going from a pure cold DM to a mixed DM scenario. When computing the 1D gaussian tension on $S_8$ the improvement is milder, from 2.4$\sigma$ to 2.0$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>A theoretical view of the T-web statistical description of the cosmic web</title>

Abstract: The classification of the cosmic web into different environments is both a tool to study in more detail the formation of halos and galaxies via the link between their properties and the large-scale environment and as a class of objects whose statistics contain cosmological information. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to compute the probability of the different environments in the cosmic web based on the T-web formalism that classifies structures in four different classes (voids, walls, filaments, knots) by studying the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor (Hessian of the gravitational potential). This method relies on studying the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor with respect to a given threshold and thus requires the knowledge of the JPDF of those eigenvalues. We perform a change of variables in terms of minimally correlated rotational invariants and we study their distribution in the linear regime of structure formation, and in the quasi-linear regime with the help of a Gram-Charlier expansion and tree-order Eulerian perturbation theory. This expansion allows us to predict the probability of the different environments in the density field at a given smoothing scale as a function of the chosen threshold and redshift. We check the validity of our predictions by comparing those predictions to measurements made in the N-body Quijote simulations. We notably find that scaling the threshold value with the non-linear amplitude of fluctuations allows us to capture almost entirely the redshift evolution of the probability of the environments, even if we assume that the density field is Gaussian (corresponding to the linear regime of structure formation). We also show that adding mild non-Gaussian corrections in the form of third-order cumulants of the field provides even more precise predictions for cosmic web abundances up to scales as small as ~5 Mpc/h and redshifts down to z~0.</description>

      <title>A comparison of shrinkage estimators of the cosmological precision matrix</title>

Abstract: The determination of the covariance matrix and its inverse, the precision matrix, is critical in the statistical analysis of cosmological measurements. The covariance matrix is typically estimated with a limited number of simulations at great computational cost before inversion into the precision matrix; therefore, it can be ill-conditioned and overly noisy when the sample size $n$ used for estimation is not much larger than the data vector dimension. In this work, we consider a class of methods known as shrinkage estimation for the precision matrix, which combines an empirical estimate with a target that is either analytical or stochastic. These methods include linear and non-linear shrinkage applied to the covariance matrix (the latter represented by the so-called NERCOME estimator), and the direct linear shrinkage estimation of the precision matrix which we introduce in a cosmological setting. Using Bayesian parameter inference as well as metrics like matrix loss functions and the eigenvalue spectrum, we compare their performance against the standard sample estimator with varying sample size $n$. We have found the shrinkage estimators to significantly improve the posterior distribution at low $n$, especially for the linear shrinkage estimators either inverted from the covariance matrix or applied directly to the precision matrix, with an empirical target constructed from the sample estimate. Our results should be particularly relevant to the analyses of Stage-IV spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid, whose statistical power can be limited by the computational cost of obtaining an accurate precision matrix estimate.</description>

      <title>Suppressing the sample variance of DESI-like galaxy clustering with fast simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing and upcoming galaxy redshift surveys, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, will observe vast regions of sky and a wide range of redshifts. In order to model the observations and address various systematic uncertainties, N-body simulations are routinely adopted, however, the number of large simulations with sufficiently high mass resolution is usually limited by available computing time. Therefore, achieving a simulation volume with the effective statistical errors significantly smaller than those of the observations becomes prohibitively expensive. In this study, we apply the Convergence Acceleration by Regression and Pooling (CARPool) method to mitigate the sample variance of the DESI-like galaxy clustering in the AbacusSummit simulations, with the assistance of the quasi-N-body simulations FastPM. Based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) models, we construct different FastPM galaxy catalogs, including the luminous red galaxies (LRGs), emission line galaxies (ELGs), and quasars, with their number densities and two-point clustering statistics well matched to those of AbacusSummit. We also employ the same initial conditions between AbacusSummit and FastPM to achieve high cross-correlation, as it is useful in effectively suppressing the variance. Our method of reducing noise in clustering is equivalent to performing a simulation with volume larger by a factor of 5 and 4 for LRGs and ELGs, respectively. We also mitigate the standard deviation of the LRG bispectrum with the triangular configurations $k_2=2k_1=0.2$ h/Mpc by a factor of 1.6. With smaller sample variance on galaxy clustering, we are able to constrain the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) scale parameters to higher precision. The CARPool method will be beneficial to better constrain the theoretical systematics of BAO, redshift space distortions (RSD) and primordial non-Gaussianity (NG).</description>

      <title>Informed total-error-minimizing priors: Interpretable cosmological parameter constraints despite complex nuisance effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Bayesian inference techniques are standard in cosmological analyses, it is common to interpret resulting parameter constraints with a frequentist intuition. This intuition can fail, for example, when marginalizing high-dimensional parameter spaces onto subsets of parameters, because of what has come to be known as projection effects or prior volume effects. We present the method of informed total-error-minimizing (ITEM) priors to address this problem. An ITEM prior is a prior distribution on a set of nuisance parameters, such as those describing astrophysical or calibration systematics, intended to enforce the validity of a frequentist interpretation of the posterior constraints derived for a set of target parameters (e.g., cosmological parameters). Our method works as follows. For a set of plausible nuisance realizations, we generate target parameter posteriors using several different candidate priors for the nuisance parameters. We reject candidate priors that do not accomplish the minimum requirements of bias (of point estimates) and coverage (of confidence regions among a set of noisy realizations of the data) for the target parameters on one or more of the plausible nuisance realizations. Of the priors that survive this cut, we select the ITEM prior as the one that minimizes the total error of the marginalized posteriors of the target parameters. As a proof of concept, we applied our method to the density split statistics measured in Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data. We demonstrate that the ITEM priors substantially reduce prior volume effects that otherwise arise and that they allow for sharpened yet robust constraints on the parameters of interest.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the variation of the fine-structure constant at 3&lt;z&lt;10 with JWST emission-line galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ at redshifts $2.5\le z&lt;9.5$ using JWST emission-line galaxies. The galaxy sample consists of 621 high-quality spectra with strong and narrow [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 doublet emission lines from 578 galaxies, including 232 spectra at $z&gt;5$. The [O III] doublet lines are arguably the best emission lines to probe the variation in $\alpha$. We divide our sample into six subsamples based on redshift and calculate the relative variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ for the individual subsamples. The calculated $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ values are consistent with zero within $1\sigma$ at all redshifts, suggesting no time variation in $\alpha$ above a level of $(1-2) \times10^{-4}$ ($1\sigma$) in the past 13.2 billion years. When the whole sample is combined, the constraint is improved to be $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.2\pm0.7) \times10^{-4}$. We further test the spatial variation in $\alpha$ using four subsamples of galaxies in four different directions on the sky. The measured $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ values are consistent with zero at a $1\sigma$ level of $\sim 2\times10^{-4}$. While the constraints in this work are not as stringent as those from lower-redshift quasar absorption lines in previous studies, this work uses an independent tracer and provides the first constraints on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ at the highest redshifts. With the growing number of emission-line galaxies from JWST, we expect to achieve stronger constraints in the future.</description>

      <title>Reassessment of the dipole in the distribution of quasars on the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate recent claims by Secrest et al. of an anomalously large amplitude of the dipole in the distribution of CatWISE-selected quasars on the sky. Two main issues indicate that the systematic uncertainties in the derived quasar-density dipole are underestimated. Firstly, the spatial distribution of the quasars is not a pure dipole, possessing low-order multipoles of comparable size to the dipole. These multipoles are unexpected and presumably caused by unknown systematic effects; we cannot be confident that the dipole amplitude is not also affected by the same systematics until the origin of these fluctuations is understood. Secondly, the 50 percent sky cut associated with the quasar catalogue strongly couples the multipoles, meaning that the power estimate at ell=1 contains significant contributions from ell&gt;1. In particular, the dominant quadrupole mode in the Galactic mask strongly couples the dipole with the octupole, leading to a large uncertainty in the dipole amplitude. Together these issues mean that the dipole in the quasar catalogue has an uncertainty large enough that consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole cannot be ruled out. More generally, current data sets are insufficiently clean to robustly measure the quasar dipole and future studies will require samples that are larger (preferably covering more of the sky) and free of systematic effects to make strong claims regarding their consistency with the CMB dipole.</description>

      <title>sOPTICS: A Modified Density-Based Algorithm for Identifying Galaxy Groups/Clusters and Brightest Cluster Galaxies</title>

Abstract: A direct approach to studying the galaxy-halo connection is to analyze groups and clusters of galaxies that trace the underlying dark matter halos, emphasizing the importance of identifying galaxy clusters and their associated brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). In this work, we test and propose a robust density-based clustering algorithm that outperforms the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm in the currently available galaxy group/cluster catalogs. Our new approach is a modified version of the Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) algorithm, which accounts for line-of-sight positional uncertainties due to redshift space distortions by incorporating a scaling factor, and is thereby referred to as sOPTICS. When tested on both a galaxy group catalog based on semi-analytic galaxy formation simulations and observational data, our algorithm demonstrated robustness to outliers and relative insensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In total, we compared the results of eight clustering algorithms. The proposed density-based clustering method, sOPTICS, outperforms FoF in accurately identifying giant galaxy clusters and their associated BCGs in various environments with higher purity and recovery rate, also successfully recovering 115 BCGs out of 118 reliable BCGs from a large galaxy sample. Furthermore, when applied to an independent observational catalog without extensive re-tuning, sOPTICS maintains high recovery efficiency, confirming its flexibility and effectiveness for large-scale astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic web in Ly$\alpha$ emission over large scales: an Intensity Mapping forecast for DECaLS/BASS and DESI</title>

Abstract: Being the most prominent HI line, Ly$\alpha$ permeates the cosmic web in emission. Despite its potential as a cosmological probe, its detection on large scales remains elusive. We present a new methodology to perform Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping with broad-band optical images, by cross-correlating them with Ly$\alpha$ forest data using a custom one-parameter estimator. We also develop an analytical large-scale Ly$\alpha$ emission model with two parameters (average luminosity $\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$ and bias $b_{\rm e}$) that respects observational constraints from QSO luminosity functions. We compute a forecast for DECaLS/BASS $g$-band images cross-correlated with DESI Ly$\alpha$ forest data, setting guidelines for reducing images into Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps. Given the transversal scales of our cross-correlation (26.4 arcmin, $\sim$33 cMpc/h), our study effectively integrates Ly$\alpha$ emission over all the cosmic volume inside the DESI footprint at $2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.4$ (the $g$-band Ly$\alpha$ redshift range). Over the parameter space ($\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$, $b_{\rm e}$) sampled by our forecast, we find a 3$\sigma$ of large-scale structure in Ly$\alpha$ likely, with a probability of detection of 23.95\% for DESI-DECaLS/BASS, and 54.93\% for a hypothetical DESI phase II with twice as much Ly$\alpha$ QSOs. Without a detection, we derive upper bounds on $\langle L_{\rm Ly\alpha} \rangle$ competitive with optimistic literature estimates ($2.3 \pm 1 \cdot 10^{\rm 41}$ erg/s/cMpc$^3$ for DESI, and $\sim$35\% lower for its hypothetical phase II). Extrapolation to the DESI-Rubin overlap shows that a detection of large-scale structure with Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping using next-generation imaging surveys is certain. [abridged]</description>

Abstract: Extended dark matter objects (EDOs) are popular dark matter candidates that interact gravitationally with the Standard Model. These gravitational interactions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However, EDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a case-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of cosmology. We thus present a repository of all available bounds for these objects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all up-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard for the EDOs' mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent with each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to the repository.</description>

      <title>Dispersion in the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant measurements from gravitational clustering</title>

Abstract: Measurements of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant ($H_0$) require us to estimate the distance and recession velocity of galaxies independently. Gravitational clustering that leads to the formation of galaxies and the large scale structure leaves its imprints in the form of peculiar velocities of galaxies. In general, it is not possible to disentangle the peculiar velocity component from the recession velocities of galaxies, and this introduces an uncertainty in the determination of $H_0$. Using N-body simulations, we quantify the impact of peculiar velocities on the $H_0$ estimation. We consider observers to be located in dark matter halos and compute the distribution of the estimated value of $H_0$ across all such observers. We find that the dispersion of this distribution is large at small scales, and it diminishes as we go to large separations, reaching the level of the quoted statistical error in Planck and SH0ES measurements well beyond $\sim$135 Mpc/h and $\sim$220 Mpc/h, respectively. Measurements at smaller scales are susceptible to errors arising from peculiar motions, and this error can propagate to measurements at larger scales in the distance ladder. Notably, we observe a negative correlation between the local over-density around an observer and the deviation of the local and the global value of $H_0$. We show that deviations more significant than 5% of the global values can be encountered frequently at scales of up to 40 Mpc/h, and this is considerably larger than the statistical errors on local estimates. We also analyse the cumulative effect of such errors on mock measurements of $H_0$ as measured from Milky Way-sized halos. We find that this error is sensitive to the lowest distance at which we use measurements. The distribution of $H_0$ in mock measurements has a large tail, and deviations of a few percent from the global value cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Forecasts and Statistical Insights for Line Intensity Mapping Cross-Correlations: A Case Study with 21cm x [CII]</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity mapping -- the large-scale mapping of selected spectral lines without resolving individual sources -- is quickly emerging as an efficient way to conduct large cosmological surveys. Multiple surveys covering a variety of lines (such as the hydrogen 21cm hyperfine line, CO rotational lines, and [CII] fine structure lines, among others) are either observing or will soon be online, promising a panchromatic view of our Universe over a broad redshift range. With multiple lines potentially covering the same volume, cross-correlations have become an attractive prospect, both for probing the underlying astrophysics and for mitigating observational systematics. For example, cross correlating 21cm and [CII] intensity maps during reionization could reveal the characteristic scale of ionized bubbles around the first galaxies, while simultaneously providing a convenient way to reduce independent foreground contaminants between the two surveys. However, many of the desirable properties of cross-correlations in principle emerge only under ideal conditions, such as infinite ensemble averages. In this paper, we construct an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing intensity mapping cross-correlations, enabling instrumental effects, foreground residuals, and analysis choices to be propagated through Monte Carlo simulations to a set of rigorous error properties, including error covariances, window functions, and full probability distributions for power spectrum estimates. We use this framework to critically examine the applicability of simplifying assumptions such as the independence and Gaussianity of power spectrum errors. As worked examples, we forecast the sensitivity of near-term and futuristic 21cm-[CII] cross-correlation measurements, providing recommendations for survey design.</description>

      <title>Third-order corrections to the slow-roll expansion: calculation and constraints with Planck, ACT, SPT, and BICEP/Keck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the primordial power spectra (PPS) of scalar and tensor perturbations, derived through the slow-roll approximation. By solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation and the tensor perturbation equation with Green's function techniques, we extend the PPS calculations to third-order corrections, providing a comprehensive perturbative expansion in terms of slow-roll parameters. We investigate the accuracy of the analytic predictions with the numerical solutions of the perturbation equations for a selection of single-field slow-roll inflationary models. We derive the constraints on the Hubble flow functions $\epsilon_i$ from Planck, ACT, SPT, and BICEP/Keck data. We find an upper bound $\epsilon_1 \lesssim 0.002$ at 95\% CL dominated by BICEP/Keck data and robust to all the different combination of datasets. We derive the constraint $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0.031 \pm 0.004$ at 68\% confidence level (CL) from the combination of Planck data and late-time probes such as baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and supernovae data at first order in the slow-roll expansion. The uncertainty on $\epsilon_2$ gets larger including second- and third-order corrections, allowing for a non-vanishing running and running of the running respectively, leading to $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0.034 \pm 0.007$ at 68\% CL. We find $\epsilon_3 \simeq 0.1 \pm 0.4$ at 95\% CL both at second and at third order in the slow-roll expansion of the spectra. $\epsilon_4$ remains always unconstrained. The combination of Planck and SPT data leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$. On the contrary, the combination of Planck data with ACT measurements, which point to higher values of the scalar spectral index compared to Planck findings, leads to shifts in the means and maximum likelihood values for $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Chern-Simons term in the Palatini formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Chern--Simons term coupled to the inflaton in the Palatini formulation of general relativity. In contrast to the metric formulation, here the Chern--Simons term affects also the background evolution. We approximately solve for the connection, insert it back into the action, and reduce the order of the equations to obtain an effective theory in the gradient approximation. We consider three cases: when the connection is unconstrained, and when non-metricity or torsion is put to zero. In the first two cases, the inflaton kinetic term is modified with a term proportional to the square of the potential. For polynomial potentials dominated by the highest power of the field, the Chern--Simons term solves the problem that higher order corrections spoil the flatness of the potential. For Higgs inflation, the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be as large as the current observational bound, and the non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar can be as small as in the metric case. The Palatini contribution cures the known instability of the tensor modes due to the Chern--Simons term in the metric formulation.</description>

      <title>Inner structure of cold and warm dark matter halos from particle dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the number of apocenter passages $p$ and the radial action $J_r$ of each particle, we characterize the phase-space structure within the multi-stream regions of cold and warm dark matter halos in cosmological $N$-body simulations. Building on previous work by Enomoto et al. (2024), we analyze the radial density profiles of particles classified by $p$ and $J_r$. We find that the profiles consistently follow a double power-law structure, independent of the dark matter model or halo mass. The inner profile exhibits a $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ behavior, which is consistent with previous studies. Notably, this characteristics persist across both classification schemes. In contrast, the outer power-law profiles display distinct behaviors depending on the classification. While particles classified by $p$ exhibit a steeper slope, ranging from $-6$ to $-8$, those classified by $J_r$ follow a common slope of approximately $-3.5$. Overall, the amplitude of the double power-law profiles varies between simulations for different dark matter models, but this variation can be attributed to statistical differences in the concentration of halos across the models.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Relativistic Species and Their Interactions with Dark Matter through CMB and 21cm surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of the 21cm power spectrum from cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization to models of free-streaming dark radiation (parameterized through $N_{\rm eff}$) and interacting dark radiation-dark matter models (DM-DR). The latter models have gained attention for their potential in addressing recent cosmological tensions and structure formation challenges. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis under different assumptions regarding the astrophysical modeling, and forecast the sensitivity of HERA observations, combined with CMB data from Planck and the Simons Observatory (SO), to $N_{\rm eff}$ and DM-DR interaction modeled using the ETHOS framework assuming a constant scattering rate between the two components. Most importantly, we find that 21cm observations can improve the sensitivity to the DM-DR interaction rate by up to four order of magnitude compared to Planck and SO. Conversely, in the limit of low interaction rate (which asymptotically matches $N_{\rm eff}$), CMB data dominates the constraining power, but the inclusion of HERA data can provide a $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitivity over CMB data alone. Moreover, we find that HERA observations will be able to probe a region of the DM-DR interaction parameter space which is promising to explain the weak lensing amplitude `$S_8$' tension. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of 21cm and CMB data in exploring dark sector interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the global signal in the redshifted hyperfine structure line 21 cm of hydrogen atoms formed during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. The evolution of the brightness temperature in this line was computed to study its dependence on the physical conditions in the intergalactic medium. We show that the profile of this line crucially depends on the temperature and ionization of baryonic matter as well as the spectral energy distribution of radiation from the first sources. The cosmological models with the self-annihilating and decaying dark matter with allowable parameters by current observational data, as well as the model of the first light which is consistent with the observational data on reionization were considered. The results show that the Dark Ages part of profile is very sensitive to the parameters of self-annihilating and decaying dark matter particles, while the Cosmic Dawn part of profile is very sensitive also to the spectral energy distribution of radiation from the first sources. It was concluded that only compatible observations of the redshifted 21 cm line in the decameter and meter wavelength range, formed during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn, will make it possible to constrain the parameters of dark matter models and astrophysical models of the first sources based on the radiotomography of the young Universe.</description>

      <title>LIMFAST. III. Timing Cosmic Reionization with the 21 cm and Near-Infrared Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The timeline of cosmic reionization remains uncertain despite sustained efforts to study how the ionizing output of early galaxies shaped the intergalactic medium (IGM). Using the semi-numerical code LIMFAST, we investigate the prospects for timing the reionization process by cross-correlating the 21 cm signal with the cosmic near-infrared background (NIRB) contributed by galaxies at $z&gt;5$. Tracing opposite phases of the IGM on large scales during reionization, the two signals together serve as a powerful probe for the reionization history. However, because long-wavelength, line-of-sight Fourier modes -- the only modes probed by NIRB fluctuations -- are contaminated by 21 cm foregrounds and thus inevitably lost to foreground cleaning or avoidance, a direct cross-correlation of the two signals vanishes. We show that this problem can be circumvented by squaring the foreground-filtered 21 cm signal and cross-correlating the squared field with the NIRB. This statistic is related to the 21 cm--21 cm--NIRB cross-bispectrum and encodes valuable information regarding the reionization timeline. Particularly, the 21 cm$^2$ and NIRB signals are positively correlated during the early phases of reionization and negatively correlated at later stages. We demonstrate that this behavior is generic across several different reionization models and compare our simulated results with perturbative calculations. We show that this cross-correlation can be detected at high significance by forthcoming 21 cm and NIRB surveys such as SKA and SPHEREx. Our methodology is more broadly applicable to cross-correlations between line intensity mapping data and 2D tracers of the large-scale structure, including photometric galaxy surveys and CMB lensing mass maps, among others.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does Mass-Redshift Correlation Matter?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings show that despite significant variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the joint mass-redshift population can be expressed as the product of the mass distribution marginalized over redshift and the redshift distribution marginalized over masses. This enables a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant - sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of Mutual Coupling (MC) between antennas on the time-delay power spectrum response of the core of the SKA-Low radio telescope. Using two in-house tools - Fast Array Simulation Tool (FAST) (a fast full-wave electromagnetic solver) and OSKAR (a GPU-accelerated radio telescope simulator) - we simulate station beams and compute visibilities for various array layouts (regular, sunflower, and random). Simulations are conducted in an Epoch of Reionisation subband between 120-150~MHz, with a fine frequency resolution of 100~kHz, enabling the investigation of longer delays. Our results show that MC effects significantly increase foreground leakage into longer delays, especially for regular station layouts. For 21-cm science, foreground spill-over into the 21-cm window extends beyond $k_{\parallel} \sim 2$~h$^{-1}$Mpc for all station layouts and across all $k_{\perp}$ modes, completely obscuring the detection window. We find that attempting to remove the foreground contribution from the visibilities using an approximated beam model, based on the average embedded element pattern or interpolating the embedded element patterns from a coarse channel rate of 781~kHz, results in residuals around 1% ($\sim 10^{11}~\mathrm{mK}^2$h$^{-3}\mathrm{Mpc}^3$) which is still around 7 orders of magnitude brighter than the expected level of the EoR signal ($\sim 10^{4}~\mathrm{mK}^2$h$^{-3}\mathrm{Mpc}^3$). We also find that station beam models with at least 4-5 significant digits in the far-field pattern and high spectral resolution are needed for effective foreground removal. Our research provides critical insights into the role of MC in SKA-Low experiments and highlights the computational challenges of fully integrating array patterns that account for MC effects into processing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector with quadratic coupling: theoretical and observational viability</title>

Abstract: Models proposing a non-gravitational interaction between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (CDM) have been extensively studied as alternatives to the standard cosmological model. A common approach to describing the DE-CDM coupling assumes it to be linearly proportional to the dark energy density. In this work, we consider the model with interaction term $Q=3H\gamma{\rho_{x}^{2}}/{(\rho_{c}+\rho_{x})}$. We show that for positive values of $\gamma$ this model predicts a future violation of the Weak Energy Condition (WEC) for the dark matter component, and for a specific range of negative values of $\gamma$ the CDM energy density can be negative in the past. We perform a parameter selection analysis for this model using data from Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and CMB combined with the Hubble constant $H_0$ prior. Imposing a prior to ensure that the WEC is not violated, our model is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM in 2$\sigma$ C.L.. In reality, the WEC prior shifts the constraints towards smaller values of $H_0$, highlighting an increase in the tension on the Hubble parameter. However, it significantly improves the parameter constraints, with a preference for smaller values of $\sigma_8$, alleviating the $\sigma_8$ tension between the CMB results from Planck 2018 and the weak gravitational lensing observations from the KiDS-1000 cosmic shear survey. In the case without the WEC prior, our model seems to alleviate the $H_0$ tension, which is related to the positive value of the interaction parameter $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of primordial black holes in an adiabatic FLRW universe with gravitational particle creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) in an adiabatic FLRW universe with dissipation due to bulk viscosity which is considered to be in the form of gravitational particle creation. Assuming that the process of evaporation is quite suppressed during the radiation era, we obtain an analytic solution for the evolution of PBH mass by accretion during this era, subject to an initial condition. We also obtain an upper bound on the accretion efficiency $\epsilon$ for $a \sim a_r$, where $a_r$ is the point of transition from the early de Sitter era to the radiation era. Furthermore, we obtain numerical solutions for the mass of a hypothetical PBH with initial mass 100 g assumed to be formed at an epoch when the value of the Hubble parameter was, say, 1 km/s/Mpc. We consider three values of the accretion efficiency, $\epsilon=0.23,0.5$, and $0.89$ for our study. The analysis reveals that the mass of the PBH increases rapidly due to the accretion of radiation in the early stages of its evolution. The accretion continues but its rate decreases gradually with the evolution of the Universe. Finally, Hawking radiation comes into play and the rate of evaporation surpasses the accretion rate so that the PBH mass starts to decrease. As the Universe grows, evaporation becomes the dominant phenomenon, and the mass of the PBH decreases at a faster rate. As argued by Debnath and Paul, the evaporated mass of the PBHs might contribute towards the dark energy budget of the late Universe.</description>

      <title>Machian Gravity: A mathematical formulation for Mach's Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The general theory of relativity (GR) was proposed with an aim of incorporating Mach's principle mathematically. Despite early hopes, it became evident that GR did not follow Mach's principle. Over time, multiple researchers attempted to develop gravity theories aligned with Machian idea. Although these theories successfully explained various aspects of Mach's principle, each of these theories possessed its own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we discuss some of these theories and then try to combine these theories into a single framework that can fully embrace Mach's principle. This new theory, termed Machian Gravity (MG) is a metric-based theory, and can be derived from the action principle, ensuring compliance with all conservation laws.
  The theory converges to GR at solar system scales, but at larger scales, it diverges from GR and aligns with various modified gravity models proposed to explain dark sectors of the universe. We have tested our theory against multiple observational data. It explains the galactic rotation curve without requiring additional dark matter (DM). The theory also resolves the discrepancy between dynamic mass and photometric mass in galaxy clusters without resorting to DM, but it introduces two additional parameters. It can also explain the expansion history of the universe without requiring dark components.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (sub)millimeter sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub)millimeter telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Probes of Asteroid Mass Primordial Black Holes: Superradiance Spectroscopy, Hawking Radiation, and Microlensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance provides a unique opportunity for investigating dark sectors as well as primordial black holes, which themselves are candidates for dark matter over a wide mass range. Using axion-like particles as an example, we show that line signals emerging from a superradiated axion cloud combined with black hole Hawking radiation in extragalactic and galactic halos, along with microlensing observations lead to complementary constraints on parameter space combinations including the axion-photon coupling, axion mass, black hole mass, and its dark matter fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}$. For the asteroid mass range $\sim10^{16}-10^{22}~{\rm g}$, where primordial black holes can provide the totality of dark matter, we demonstrate that ongoing and upcoming observations such as SXI, JWST, and AMEGO-X will be sensitive to possible line and continuum signals, respectively, providing probes of previously inaccessible regions of $f_{\rm PBH}$ parameter space. Further complementarity from a stochastic gravitational-wave background emerging from the black hole formation mechanism is also considered.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Ionizing Photon Contributions of High-Redshift Galaxies to Reionization with JWST NIRCam Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST is providing constraints on the history of reionization owing to its ability to detect faint galaxies at $z\gg6$. Modeling this history requires understanding both the ionizing photon production rate ($\xi_{\rm ion}$) and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium ($f_{\rm esc}$). Observational estimates of these quantities generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions are limited. To overcome this challenge, we present and release an implicit likelihood inference pipeline, PHOTONIOn, trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies ($\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. We show that PHOTONIOn is able to reliably infer $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$ from photometry. This is in contrast to traditional SED-fitting approaches which rely on $f_{\rm esc}$ prescriptions that often over-predict $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$ for LyC-dim galaxies, even when given access to spectroscopic data. We have deployed PHOTONIOn on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding gentle redshift evolutions of $\log_{10}(\dot{N}_{\rm ion}) = (0.08\pm0.01)z + (51.60\pm0.06)$ and $\log_{10}(f_{\rm esc}\xi_{\rm ion}) = (0.07\pm0.01)z + (24.12\pm0.07)$. Late-time values for the ionizing photon production rate density are consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the IGM ionized fraction to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization in GOODS-S to completion by $z\sim 5.3$ without the need for AGN or other exotic sources, consistent with other studies of the same field. The $20\%$ of UV-brightest galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-18.5$) reionize $35\%$ of the survey volume, demonstrating that UV faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.</description>

      <title>Indirect Searches for Ultraheavy Dark Matter in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may exist today in the form of ultraheavy composite bound states. Collisions between such dark matter states can release intense bursts of radiation that includes gamma-rays among the final products. Thus, indirect-detection signals of dark matter may include unconventional gamma-ray bursts. Such bursts may have been missed not necessarily because of their low arriving gamma-ray fluxes, but rather their briefness and rareness. We point out that intense bursts whose non-detection thus far are due to the latter can be detected in the near future with existing and planned facilities. In particular, we propose that, with slight experimental adjustments and suitable data analyses, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared and Optical Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) are promising tools for detecting such rare, brief, but intense bursts. We also show that if we assume these bursts originate from collisions of dark matter states, IACTs and PANOSETI can probe a large dark matter parameter space beyond existing limits. Additionally, we present a concrete model of dark matter that produces bursts potentially detectable in these instruments.</description>

      <title>COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA): $N$-body simulations in an emulated frame of reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, so machine-learning (ML)-based emulation techniques have emerged as a way to increase their speed. Although fast, surrogate models have limited trustworthiness due to potentially substantial emulation errors that current approaches cannot correct for. To alleviate this problem, we introduce COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA), a hybrid framework interfacing ML with an $N$-body simulator. The correct physical equations of motion are solved in an emulated frame of reference, so that any emulation error is corrected by design. This approach corresponds to solving for the perturbation of particle trajectories around the machine-learnt solution, which is computationally cheaper than obtaining the full solution, yet is guaranteed to converge to the truth as one increases the number of force evaluations. Although applicable to any ML algorithm and $N$-body simulator, this approach is assessed in the particular case of particle-mesh cosmological simulations in a frame of reference predicted by a convolutional neural network, where the time dependence is encoded as an additional input parameter to the network. COCA efficiently reduces emulation errors in particle trajectories, requiring far fewer force evaluations than running the corresponding simulation without ML. We obtain accurate final density and velocity fields for a reduced computational budget. We demonstrate that this method shows robustness when applied to examples outside the range of the training data. When compared to the direct emulation of the Lagrangian displacement field using the same training resources, COCA's ability to correct emulation errors results in more accurate predictions. COCA makes $N$-body simulations cheaper by skipping unnecessary force evaluations, while still solving the correct equations of motion and correcting for emulation errors made by ML.</description>

      <title>Successful cogenesis of baryon and dark matter from memory-burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of producing the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) and dark matter (DM) from evaporating primordial black holes (PBH) beyond the semi-classical regime incorporating the impact of memory burden. In the simplest scenario of baryogenesis via vanilla leptogenesis with hierarchical right handed neutrino (RHN), it is possible to generate the observed BAU with memory-burdened PBH being sole contributor to the production of RHN. While it is not possible to achieve cogenesis in this minimal setup due to structure formation constraints on relic allowed DM parameter space, we show the viability of successful cogenesis in the resonant leptogenesis regime. We also show that successful cogenesis can be achieved in a simple baryogenesis model without taking the leptogenesis route. Due to the possibility of generating asymmetry even below the sphaleron decoupling era, the direct baryogenesis route opens up new parameter space of memory-burdened PBH. The two scenarios of successful cogenesis can also be distinguished by observations of stochastic gravitational waves produced from PBH density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational and electromagnetic Cherenkov radiation constraints in modified dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity, one could consider that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature at all energy scales. Following this spirit, modified dispersion relations have been used to encapsulate quantum gravity phenomenology. In the present work, we propose a class of Lorentz invariance violating phenomenological dispersion relations, which could be different for each particle species, to study the generalized vacuum Cherenkov radiation process. We identify the kinematic regions where the process is allowed and then compute the energy loss rate due to the emission of vacuum electromagnetic and gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Furthermore, we estimate constraints for the Lorentz invariance breaking parameters of protons and gravitons taking into account the existence (or absence) of vacuum gravitational Cherenkov radiation using ultra high energy cosmic ray detections.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on warm chromoinflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22624</link>

Abstract: We explore a model of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton field coupled to a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field. This model naturally leads to a warm inflation scenario, where the inflationary dynamics is dominated by thermal dissipation. In this work, we consider a scenario where the inflaton, an axion-like field, is coupled to the $SU(2)$ gauge field, similar to chromoinflation models. Both the inflaton and the gauge field with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value are coupled to a thermal radiation bath. We demonstrate that the presence of the thermal bath during warm chromoinflation induces a thermal plasma mass for the background gauge field. This thermal mass can significantly disrupt the dynamics of the background gauge field, thereby driving it to its trivial null solution.</description>

      <title>Variation of the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the stellar mass functions obtained from 20 radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation in 500 M$_\odot$ molecular clouds with metallicities of 3, 1, 1/10 and 1/100 of the solar value, with the clouds subjected to levels of the cosmic microwave background radiation that are appropriate for star formation at redshifts z=0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The calculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium and treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass distributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or metallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical Galactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation (z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100 solar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a larger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and redshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being unable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer cosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we provide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of galaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the mass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass function, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>On Legacy of Starobinsky Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>
