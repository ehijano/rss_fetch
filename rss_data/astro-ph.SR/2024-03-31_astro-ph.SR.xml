      <title>The Hybrid Debris Disk Host Star HD 21997 is a High-Frequency Delta Scuti Pulsator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 21997 is host to a prototypical "hybrid" debris disk characterized by debris disk-like dust properties and a CO gas mass comparable to a protoplanetary disk. We use Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite time series photometry to demonstrate that HD 21997 is a high-frequency delta Scuti pulsator. If the mode identification can be unambiguously determined in future works, an asteroseismic age of HD 21997 may become feasible.</description>

      <title>Probing solar modulation analytic models with cosmic ray periodic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AMS02 experiment has published the periodic spectra of proton, helium and helium isotopes across the majority of the 24 solar cycle. These precise data exhibit temporal structures that correlate with solar modulation. In this study, we utilize these data to probe three analytic solar modulation models, including the force-field approximation, the convection-diffusion model and the extended force-field approximation with a drift effect. We adopt a method that eliminates the influence of interstellar cosmic ray spectra, and use the Earth-observed spectra at time $t_1$ to predict those at time $t_2$. In order to explore the rigidity-dependence of solar modulation models, we substitute the conventional potential parameter $\phi$ with a modified parameter $\phi'=\frac{R}{ k_2(R)}\phi$ for our analysis. Combining with the $\chi^2$ minimization method, the best-fit modulation parameter $\phi'$ can be evaluated. First, we test the validity of a rigidity-independent $\phi'$ and find that both the force-field approximation (FFA) and the extended force-field approximation (EFFA) agree well with data near the solar minimum period. However, all models significantly deviate from the data during the solar maximum. Consequently, we assume a constant $\phi'(t_1)$ at solar minimum and calculate $\Delta\phi'=\phi'(t_2)-\phi'(t_1)$ for each rigidity bin at time $t_2$. It is found that $\Delta\phi'$ generally adheres to a linear-logarithm relationship with rigidity at any given time. By adopting a linear-logarithm formula of $\Delta\phi'$, we further discover that both the modified FFA and EFFA can reconcile the observations during solar maxima. This suggests that at solar maximum, the parameter $\phi'$, which correlates with the diffusion pattern in the heliospheric magnetic fields, exhibits a rigidity dependence.</description>

      <title>Clumpy accretion as a possible reason of prolonged eclipses of UX~Ori type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a model of deep and prolonged eclipses of young stars of the UX~Ori type. Some of these events continue for decades and existing models cannot explain them. Our paper shows that such eclipses can be caused by the falling of gas and dust clump from the remnants of the protostellar cloud onto the protoplanetary disk. The disturbance in the disk caused by the fall of the clump leads to a surge in the accretion activity of the star and, as a consequence, to an increase in the disk wind. If the circumstellar disk is tilted at a slight angle to the line of sight, then dust raised by the wind from the surface of the disk can cause a strong decrease in the star's brightness, which can last for decades.</description>

      <title>Post-AGB candidate IRAS 02143+5852: Cepheid-like variability, three-layer circumstellar dust envelope and spectral features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of multicolour $UBVR_{\text{C}}I_{\text{C}}JHK$ photometry, spectroscopic analysis and spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling for the post-AGB candidate IRAS 02143+5852. We detected Cepheid-like light variations with the full peak-to-peak amplitude $\Delta V\sim0.9$ mag and the pulsation period of about 24.9 d. The phased light curves appeared typical for the W Vir Cepheids. The period-luminosity relation for the Type II Cepheids yielded the luminosity $\log L/L_{\odot}\sim2.95$. From a low-resolution spectrum, obtained at maximum brightness, the following atmospheric parameters were determined: $T_\text{eff}\sim7400$ K and $\log g\sim1.38$. This spectrum contains the emission lines H$\alpha$, BaII $\lambda$6496.9, HeI $\lambda$10830 and Pa$\beta$. Spectral monitoring performed in 2019-2021 showed a significant change in the H$\alpha$ profile and appearance of CH and CN molecular bands with pulsation phase. The metal lines are weak. Unlike typical W Vir variables, the star shows a strong excess of infrared radiation associated with the presence of a heavy dust envelope around the star. We modelled the SED using our photometry and archival data from different catalogues and determined the parameters of the circumstellar dust envelope. We conclude that IRAS~02143+5852 is a low-luminosity analogue of dusty RV Tau stars.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Starspots on Spectroscopic Age and Mass Estimates of Non-Accreting T~Tauri Stars in the Taurus-Auriga Star Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate age and mass determinations for young pre-main sequence stars are made challenging by the presence of large-scale starspots. We present results from a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of ten T-Tauri Stars in Taurus-Auriga that characterize spot filling factors and temperatures, the resulting effects on temperature and luminosity determinations, and the consequences for inferred stellar masses and ages. We constructed composite models of spotted stars by combining BTSettl-CIFIST synthetic spectra of atmospheres to represent the spots and the photosphere along with continuum emission from a warm inner disk. Using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm, we find the best-fit spot and photospheric temperatures, spot filling factors, as well as disk filling factors. This methodology allowed us to reproduce the 0.75-2.40 micron stellar spectra and molecular feature strengths for all of our targets, disentangling the complicated multi-component emission. For a subset of stars with multi-epoch observations spanning an entire stellar rotation, we correlate the spectral variability and changes in the filling factors with rotational periods observed in K2 and AAVSO photometry. Combining spot-corrected effective temperatures and Gaia distances, we calculate luminosities and use the Stellar Parameters of Tracks with Starspots (SPOTS) models to infer spot-corrected masses and ages for our sample of stars. Our method of accounting for spots results in an average increase of 60% in mass and a doubling in age with respect to traditional methods using optical spectra that do not account for the effect of spots.</description>

      <title>On the origin of mixed morphology supernova remnants: Linking their properties to the evolution of a red supergiant progenitor star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-morphology supernova remnants (MMSNRs) are characterized by a shell-like morphology in the radio and centrally-peaked thermal emission in the X-ray band. The nature of this peculiar class of supernova remnants (SNRs) remains a controversial issue. In this work, by pairing the predictions of stellar evolution theory with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations we show that the mixed morphology properties of a SNR can arise by the interaction of the SNR with the circumstellar medium shaped by a red supergiant progenitor star, embedded in a dense environment. As a study case, we model the circumstellar medium formation and the subsequent interaction of the SNR with it of a $15~\rm M_{\odot}$ progenitor star. The reflected shock, formed by the collision of the SNR with the density walls of the surrounding circumstellar cavity, accumulates and re-shocks the supernova ejecta at the center of the remnant, increasing its temperature so that the gas becomes X-ray bright. Such a formation mechanism may naturally explain the nature of MMSNRs resulted from Type II supernovae without the demand of additional physical mechanisms and/or ambient medium inhomogeneities. We discuss alternative evolutionary paths that potentially could be ascribed for the MMSNR formation within the framework of the reflected shock model.</description>

      <title>Large-field CO (J=1-0) observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5</title>

Abstract: Aims. We aim to investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5, and explore its association with ambient molecular clouds (MCs). Methods. We present large-field CO (J=1-0) molecular line observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5, using the 13.7 m millimeter telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. The observations have an angular resolution of $\sim 55 ''$. We analyzed the spatial distribution of MCs in relation to the SNR shell detected in previous Urumqi $\lambda$ 6 cm radio observations and examined the CO spectra for kinematics information. Results. We find that MCs at the velocity range of [-14, -2] km s$^{-1}$ are spatially distributed along the radio shell of the SNR. Line broadening and asymmetries are observed in the CO spectra of the clouds. Moreover, we find that the molecular clouds around the shell have systematic velocity gradients in the position-velocity (PV) diagrams. Both morphology alignment and gas kinematics suggest that the SNR is associated with the ambient MCs at $\sim$ 740 pc. Based on the CO gas distance, the dimension and the age of the SNR is estimated to be 40 pc $\times$ 33 pc and 3.8 $ \times 10^4$ years, respectively. The very high energy emission of 1LHAASO J0428+5531 toward the SNR may originate from the interaction between the SNR and the surrounding MCs.</description>

      <title>Predissociation dynamics of the hydroxyl radical (OH) based on a five-state spectroscopic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) potential energy curves (PECs) and spin-orbit couplings for the X $^2\Pi$, A $^2 \Sigma^+$, 1 $^2 \Sigma^-$, 1 $^4 \Sigma^-$, and 1 $^4 \Pi$ states of OH are computed and refined against empirical energy levels and transitions to produce a spectroscopic model. Predissociation lifetimes are determined by discretising continuum states in the variational method nuclear motion calculation by restricting the calculation to finite range of internuclear separations. Varying this range give a series of avoided crossings between quasi-bound states associated with the A $^2 \Sigma^+$ and continuum states, from which predissociation lifetimes are extracted. 424 quasi-bound A $^2 \Sigma^+$ state rovibronic energy levels are analysed and 374 predissociation lifetimes are produced, offering good coverage of the predissociation region. Agreement with measured lifetimes is satisfactory and a majority of computed results were within experimental uncertainty. A previously unreported A $^2 \Sigma^+$ state predissociation channel which goes via the X $^2\Pi$ is identified in the calculations. A python package, binslt, is produced to calculate predissociation lifetimes, associated line broadening parameters, and uncertainties from Duo *.states files is made available. The PECs and other curves from this work will be used to produce a rovibronic ExoMol linelist and temperature-dependent photodissociation cross sections for the hydroxyl radical.</description>

      <title>Employing the coupled EUHFORIA-OpenGGCM model to predict CME geoeffectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) is a physics-based data-driven solar wind and CME propagation model designed for space weather forecasting and event analysis investigations. Although EUHFORIA can predict the solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties at Earth, it is not equipped to quantify the geoeffectiveness of the solar transients in terms of the geomagnetic indices like the disturbance storm time (Dst) index and the eauroral indices that quantify the impact of the magnetized plasma encounters on Earth's magnetosphere. Therefore, we couple EUHFORIA with the Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM), a magnetohydrodynamic model of the response of Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere, to transient solar wind characteristics. In this coupling, OpenGGCM is driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field obtained from EUHFORIA simulations to produce the magnetospheric and ionospheric response to the CMEs. This coupling is validated with two observed geoeffective CME events driven with the spheromak flux-rope CME model. We compare these simulation results with the indices obtained from OpenGGCM simulations driven by the measured solar wind data from spacecraft. We further employ the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique to assess the model performance in predicting Dst. The main highlight of this study is to use EUHFORIA simulated time series to predict the Dst and auroral indices 1 to 2 days in advance, as compared to using the observed solar wind data at L1, which only provides predictions 1 to 2 hours before the actual impact.</description>

      <title>Foreground Dust Properties towards the Cluster NGC 7380</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using starlight polarization, we present the properties of foreground dust towards cluster NGC 7380 embedded in H{\sc ii} region Sh 2-142. Observations of starlight polarization are carried out in four filters using an imaging polarimeter equipped with a 104-cm ARIES telescope. Polarization vectors of stars are aligned along the Galactic magnetic field. Towards the east and southeast regions, the dust structure appears much denser than in other regions (inferred from extinction contours and colour composite image) and is also reflected in polarization distribution. We find that the polarization degree and extinction tend to increase with distance and indication for the presence of a dust layer at a distance of around 1.2 $kpc$. We have identified eight potential candidates exhibiting intrinsic polarization by employing three distinct criteria to distinguish between stars of intrinsic polarization and interstellar polarized stars. For interstellar polarized stars, we find that the maximum polarization degree increases with the color excess and has a strong scatter, with the mean value of 1.71$\pm$0.57$\%$. The peak wavelength spans $0.40-0.88\mu$m with the mean value of 0.56$\pm$0.07 $\mu m$, suggesting similar grain sizes in the region as the average diffuse interstellar medium. The polarization efficiency is also found to decrease with visual extinction as $P_{max}/A_{V}\propto A_{V}^{-0.61}$. Our observational results are found to be consistent with the predictions by the radiative torque alignment theory.</description>

      <title>A catalogue of asteroseismically calibrated ages for APOGEE DR17. The predictions of a CatBoost machine learning model based on the [Mg/Ce] chemical clock and other stellar parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the Milky Way's formation and evolution across cosmic epochs necessitates precise stellar age determination across all Galactic components. Recent advancements in asteroseismology, spectroscopy, stellar modelling, and machine learning, coupled with all-sky surveys, now offer highly reliable stellar age estimates. Aims. This study aims to furnish accurate age assessments for the Main Red Star Sample within the APOGEE DR17 catalogue. Leveraging asteroseismic age constraints, we employ machine learning to achieve this goal. Methods. We explore optimal non-asteroseismic stellar parameters, including T$_{eff}$, L, [CI/N], [Mg/Ce], [$\alpha$/Fe], U(LSR) velocity, and 'Z' vertical height from the Galactic plane, to predict ages via categorical gradient boost decision trees. Training merges samples from the TESS Southern Continuous Viewing Zone and Second APOKASC catalogue to mitigate data shifts, enhancing prediction reliability. Validation employs an independent dataset from the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program. Results. Our model yields a median fractional age error of 20.8%, with a prediction variance of 4.77%. Median fractional errors for stars older than 3 Gyr range from 7% to 23%, from 1 to 3 Gyr range from 26% to 28%, and for stars younger than 1 Gyr, it's 43%. Applicable to 125,445 stars in the APOGEE DR17 Main Red Star Sample, our analysis confirms previous findings on the young Galactic disc's flaring and reveals an age gradient among the youngest Galactic plane stars. Additionally, we identify two groups of metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; -1 dex) young stars (Age &lt; 2 Gyr) exhibiting similar chemical abundances and halo kinematics, likely remnants of the predicted third gas infall episode (~2.7 Gyr ago).</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of Magnetohydrodynamic Wave Mode Conversion Near a 3D Null Point on the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual conversion of various kinds of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves can have profound impacts on wave propagation, energy transfer, and heating of the solar chromosphere and corona. Mode conversion occurs when an MHD wave travels through a region where the Alfv\'en and sound speeds are equal (e.g., a 3D magnetic null point). Here we report the first EUV imaging of mode conversion from a fast-mode to a slow-mode MHD wave near a 3D null point using Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) observations. An incident fast EUV wavefront associated with an adjacent eruptive flare propagates laterally through a neighboring pseudostreamer. Shortly after the passage of the fast EUV wave through the null point, a slow-mode wave appears near the null that propagates upward along the open structures and simultaneously downward along the separatrix encompassing the fan loops of the pseudostreamer base. These observations suggest the existence of mode conversion near 3D nulls in the solar corona, as predicted by theory and MHD simulations. Moreover, we observe decaying transverse oscillations in both the open and closed structures of the pseudostreamer, along with quasiperiodic type III radio bursts indicative of repetitive episodes of electron acceleration.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Dominant Formation Mechanism of Multi-Planetary Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most, if not all, sun-like stars host one or more planets, making multi-planetary systems commonplace in our galaxy. We utilize hundreds of multi-planet simulations to explore the origin of such systems, focusing on their orbital architecture. The first set of simulations assumes in-situ assembly of planetary embryos, while the second explores planetary migration. After applying observational biases to the simulations, we compare them to 250+ observed multi-planetary systems, including 13 systems with planets in the habitable zone. For all of the systems, we calculate two of the so-called statistical measures: the mass concentration ($S_{c}$) and orbital spacing ($S_{s}$). After analytic and empirical analyses, we find that the measures are related to first-order with a power law: $S_{c} \sim S_{s}^\beta$. The in-situ systems exhibit steeper power-law relations relative to the migration systems. We show that different formation scenarios cover different regions in the $S_{s} - S_{c}$ diagram with some overlap. Furthermore, we discover that observed systems with $S_{s} &lt; 30$ are likely dominated by the migration scenario, while those with $S_{s} \geq 30$ are likely dominated by the in-situ scenario. We apply these criteria to determine that a majority (62%) of observed multi-planetary systems formed via migration, whereas most systems with currently observed habitable planets formed via in-situ assembly. This work provides methods of leveraging the statistical measures ($S_{s}$ and $S_{c}$) to disentangle the formation history of observed multi-planetary systems based on their present-day architectures.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>

      <title>3D Gap Opening in Non-Ideal MHD Protoplanetary Disks: Asymmetric Accretion, Meridional Vortices, and Observational Signatures</title>

Abstract: Recent high-angular resolution ALMA observations have revealed rich information about protoplanetary disks, including ubiquitous substructures and three-dimensional gas kinematics at different emission layers. One interpretation of these observations is embedded planets. Previous 3-D planet-disk interaction studies are either based on viscous simulations, or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations with simple prescribed magnetic diffusivities. This study investigates the dynamics of gap formation in 3-D non-ideal MHD disks using non-ideal MHD coefficients from the look-up table that is self-consistently calculated based on the thermo-chemical code. We find a concentration of the poloidal magnetic flux in the planet-opened gap (in agreement with previous work) and enhanced field-matter coupling due to gas depletion, which together enable efficient magnetic braking of the gap material, driving a fast accretion layer significantly displaced from the disk midplane. The fast accretion helps deplete the gap further and is expected to negatively impact the growth of planetary embryos. It also affects the corotation torque by shrinking the region of horseshoe orbits on the trailing side of the planet. Together with the magnetically driven disk wind, the fast accretion layer generates a large, persistent meridional vortex in the gap, which breaks the mirror symmetry of gas kinematics between the top and bottom disk surfaces. Finally, by studying the kinematics at the emission surfaces, we discuss the implications of planets in realistic non-ideal MHD disks on kinematics observations.</description>
