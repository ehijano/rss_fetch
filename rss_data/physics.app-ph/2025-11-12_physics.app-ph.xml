      <title>Passive Acoustic Monitoring of Underwater Well Leakages with Machine Learning: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abandoned oil and gas wells pose significant environmental risks due to the potential leakage of hydrocarbons, brine and chemical pollutants. Detecting such leaks remains extremely challenging due to the weak acoustic emission and high ambient noise in the deep sea. This paper reviews the application of passive sonar systems combined with artificial intelligence (AI) in underwater oil and gas leak detection. The advantages and limitations of traditional monitoring methods, including fibre optic, capacitive and pH sensors, are compared with those of passive sonar systems. Advanced AI methods that enhance signal discrimination, noise suppression and data interpretation capabilities are explored for leak detection. Emerging solutions such as embedded AI analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs), deep learning-based denoising networks and semantically aware underwater optical communication (UOC) frameworks are also discussed to overcome issues such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and transmission instability. Furthermore, a hybrid approach combining non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and temporal models (GRU, TCN) is proposed to improve the classification and quantification accuracy of leak events. Despite challenges such as data scarcity and environmental change, AI-assisted passive sonar has shown great potential in real-time, energy-efficient and non-invasive underwater monitoring, contributing to sustainable environmental protection and maritime safety management.</description>

      <title>Multimode structured neutron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental realization of neutron orbital angular momentum (OAM) states and neutron Airy beams has opened new avenues for structured neutron science in both materials characterization and fundamental physics. These additional degrees of freedom in scattering experiments enable the exploration of selection rules for neutrons, the analysis of scattering properties in topological materials, and the generation of auto-focusing neutron beams. In the effort to enhance the amount of spatial and angular-momentum information retrievable from a single measurement, and to overcome current phase-grating efficiency limits, here we demonstrate multimode structured neutron beams that enable simultaneous access to multiple, well-defined OAM modes, and to hybrid combinations of OAM and Airy states. This multimode approach, analogous to wavelength- or OAM-multiplexing in optics, facilitates the efficient investigation of material scattering properties and nuclear interactions with a neutron source composed of a discretized OAM spectrum.</description>

      <title>Enhanced cooperativity of J-exciton-polaritons in dielectric BIC metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sources of highly correlated photons are critical for non-linear optics, emerging quantum information, communication and sensing technologies, as well as for fundamental studies of light-matter interaction. A strategy to realize such sources relies on the cooperative coupling of quantum emitters, enabling collective light emission known as superradiance. Here, we demonstrate that organic molecular J-aggregates exhibit room temperature superradiant emission that transitions to a highly collective regime of ~250 synchronized J-excitons when strongly coupled to delocalized photonic modes of a silicon bound-state-in-the-continuum metasurface. This enhanced cooperativity manifests as a Rabi splitting dependent scaling of both emission rate and intensity, driving the system into a superbunching regime of photon statistics. At the highest excitation density, we observe massively superbunched photon emission with g2(0)&gt;13, unlocking new possibilities for engineering ultrafast, temporally correlated light sources that can operate at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Second-Harmonic Magnetoacoustic Ultrasound from Magnetic Nanoparticles under Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of mechanical wave generation by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs, 65mT, 800 kHz, at 100ms bursts) in the ultrasonic (US) frequency range. We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples. This phenomenon could pave the way for new theoretical and practical approaches as for 'in vivo' magnetoacoustics theragnostic.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing in a lithium-based magneto-ionic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-materio computing exploits the intrinsic physical dynamics of materials to perform complex computations, enabling low-power, real-time data processing by embedding computation directly within physical layers. Here, we demonstrate a voltage-controlled magneto-ionic device that functions as a reservoir computer capable of forecasting chaotic time series. The device consists of a crossbar structure with a Ta/CoFeB/Ta/MgO/Ta bottom electrode and a LiPON/Pt top electrode. A chaotic Mackey-Glass time series is encoded into a voltage signal applied to the device, while 2D Fourier transforms of voltage-dependent magnetic domain patterns form the output. Performance is influenced by the input rate, smoothing of the output, the number of elements in the reservoir state vector, and the training duration. We identify two distinct computational regimes: short-term prediction is optimized using smoothed, low-dimensional states with minimal training, whereas prediction around the Mackey-Glass delay time benefits from unsmoothed, high-dimensional states and extended training. Reservoir computing metrics reveal that slower input rates are more tolerant to output smoothing, while faster input rates degrade both memory capacity and nonlinear processing. These findings demonstrate the potential of magneto-ionic systems for neuromorphic computing and offer design principles for tuning performance in response to input signal characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model and Optimization for Deep Space Radiation Shielding Based on Proton Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the "gram-scale weight reduction" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding "lightweight performance" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with "proton density" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness &lt;=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' "mass savings" and high-Z materials' "space savings." When rho_p&lt;1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p&gt;1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tracking of Persistent, Localized Speckles in Turbulent Atmospheric Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light propagation through turbulence produces speckles, whose ensemble behavior is typically characterized by snapshot intensity statistics. Here, we track the spatiotemporal evolution of individual speckles and quantify fragmentation, localization, and persistence under different diffraction and turbulence scales. Beam fragmentation coincides with complete spatial decorrelation defined by the magnitude-squared coherence. Fragmentation occurs closer to the source for larger beams, which indicates that smaller beams are more robust to decoherence. Subsequently, speckles are both spatially localized and persistent over distances significantly longer than their associated Rayleigh length. The combination of localization and persistence impacts the statistics of light relevant to their long-distance signaling and sensing.</description>

      <title>Low-Field Ferroelectricity in 10 nm AlBScN Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric aluminum scandium nitride (Al1-xScxN, AlScN) offers CMOS-compatible integration but suffers from high coercive fields and leakage currents that hinder thickness scaling. Further reduction in thickness is essential for low-voltage embedded nonvolatile memory applications. Boron incorporation into AlScN (AlBScN) suppresses leakage current in films down to 40 nm, yet its ferroelectric characteristics in ultrathin films remains unexplored. This letter demonstrates robust ferroelectric switching in 10 nm sputtered AlBScN capacitors with a low coercive field and approximately two orders of magnitude lower leakage than AlScN. Notably, ferroelectric switching was observed at 2.2 MV/cm in capacitance-voltage measurements, and symmetric polarization reversal occurred near 4.6 MV/cm in positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurements using 2 {\mu}s pulses. Moreover, Weibull analysis revealed a breakdown-to-coercive-field ratio (EBD/Ec) of ~2.2. These findings demonstrated AlBScN as a promising candidate for CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible ferroelectric applications with improved energy consumption and reduced leakage current.</description>

      <title>Inversion of the impedance response towards physical parameter extraction using interpretable machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting the impedance response of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is challenging due to the complex coupling of ionic and electronic motion. While drift-diffusion (DD) modelling is a reliable method, its mathematical complexity makes directly extracting physical parameters from experimental data infeasible. This work uses DD modelling to generate a large synthetic dataset of impedance spectra for a standard TiO2/MAPI/spiro configuration. This dataset trains machine learning (ML) models to predict recombination and ionic parameters from impedance measurements. A Gradient Boosting Regressor, using features from a generalized equivalent circuit, showed the best performance. Interpretative analysis indicates open-circuit impedance experiments best probe recombination losses, while short-circuit conditions are more adequate for extracting ionic features like concentrations and mobilities. The trained ML models were tested on experimental spectra, confirming the inferred physical parameters could reproduce the data. For the studied configuration, predicted ion concentrations were (1.3-3.3) 10^17 cm-3, ion mobilities were (5-7) 10^-11 cm2V-1s-1, and surface recombination velocities were 7-9 and 23-35 m/s. This approach provides insights into the physical information extractable from impedance measurements and paves the way for ML models to unambiguously derive efficiency-determining parameters for solar cells.</description>

Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.</description>

      <title>Broadband Kinetic-Inductance Parametric Amplifiers with Impedance Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadband quantum-limited parametric amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in quantum information science and technology. Impedance-engineered resonator-based PAs and traveling-wave PAs are the primary approaches to overcome the gain-bandwidth constraint. While the former PAs are simpler to fabricate, the target characteristic impedance Z_\text{NR} of the nonlinear resonator has been restricted to be below 10 \Omega, requiring large capacitance. Moreover, these PAs have only been implemented with aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs), hindering their operation at high temperatures or strong magnetic fields. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage impedance-transformer scheme, showcased with a 20-nm-thick, 250-nm-wide high-kinetic-inductance niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN) film. Our scheme enables Z_\text{NR} up to several tens of ohms--a tenfold improvement over conventional designs, achieved through an additional quarter-wavelength transmission line with the characteristic impedance of 180 \Omega. Our kinetic-inductance impedance-engineered parametric amplifiers (KIMPA), featuring a 330-fF shunt capacitor, demonstrate a phase-preserving amplification with a 450-MHz bandwidth at 17-dB gain, and an added noise ranging from 0.5-1.3 quanta near the center frequency of 8.4 GHz. Due to the high critical current of the NbTiN nanowire, the KIMPA also achieves a saturation power of up to -68\pm3 dBm, approximately 30-dB higher than that of JJ-based PAs. This scheme also opens new possibilities for other three-wave-mixing building blocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded $\pi$-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials that are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) is synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, the quantum transport properties of hNPGs are studied. It is found that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). A simple model is proposed to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, it is found that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</description>

      <title>Retardance of lab grown diamond substrates as a function of thickness: momentum-drift random walk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.</description>

Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or by limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets - exemplified by experimentally feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistances of 11,704%, 2,496% and 1,892%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of the electrodes and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and zero stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and vanishing magnetic moment, combining the advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a practically versatile platform to realize the revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</description>
