      <title>Chiral kinematic theory and converse vortical effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07064</link>

Abstract: Response theories in condensed matter typically describe the response of an electron fluid to external electromagnetic fields, while perturbations on neutral particles are often designed to mimic such fields. Here, we study the response of fermions to a space-time-dependent velocity field, thereby sidestepping the issue of a gauge charge. We first develop a semiclassical chiral kinematic theory that contains a subtle modification of the phase space measure due to the interplay between the Berry curvature and fluid rotation. The theory immediately predicts a converse vortical effect, defined as an orbital magnetization driven by linear velocity. It receives contributions from magnetic moments on the Fermi surface and Berry curvature of the occupied bands, with the latter stemming from the modified measure. Then, transcending semiclassics via a complementary Kubo formalism reveals that the uniform limit of a clean system receives only the Berry curvature contribution, thus asserting the importance of the modified measure, while other limits sense the Fermi surface magnetic moments too. We propose CoSi as a candidate material, and we suggest conducting magnetometry measurements on a sample under a thermal gradient to detect the effect. Overall, our study sheds light on the effects of a space-time-dependent velocity field on electron fluids and paves the way for exploring quantum materials using new probes and perturbations.</description>

      <title>Abundant surface-semimetal phases in three-dimensional obstructed atomic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) are characterized by the appearance of floating surface states (FSSs) at specific surfaces. Benefiting from this feature, our study here shows the presence of abundant surface-semimetal phases in 3D OAIs. The symmetries of obstructed Wannier charge centers ensure the degeneracy of such FSSs at high-symmetry points or invariant lines in the surface Brillouin zone. Utilizing topological quantum chemistry theory, we identify a carbon allotrope with a body-centered tetragonal structure, named bct-C20, as an ideal candidate for realizing different kinds of surface-semimetal phases. For the (001)surface of bct-C20, there are four in-gap FSSs, and these four FSSs form two kinds of surface Dirac cones, i.e., topological Dirac cones with linear dispersion and symmetry-enforced quadratic Dirac cones. The band topology of a surface Dirac cone is captured by the effective surface Hamiltonian and the emergence of hinge states. Moreover, the existence of the surface-nodal-line state is also discussed. This work reports an approach to obtain d-dimensional semimetal phases from the surface states of (d + 1)-dimensional systems, which is of great significance for the studies in revealing topological states and their practical applications in high-dimensional crystals.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: I. Calculation of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.</description>
