      <title>S2Vec: Self-Supervised Geospatial Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate S2Vec on three large-scale socioeconomic prediction tasks, showing its competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-based embeddings. We also explore the benefits of combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve performance. Our results highlight how S2Vec can learn effective general-purpose geospatial representations and how it can complement other data modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Burning some myths on privacy properties of social networks against active attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on showing some arguments addressed to dismantle the extended idea about that social networks completely lacks of privacy properties. We consider the so-called active attacks to the privacy of social networks and the counterpart $(k,\ell)$-anonymity measure, which is used to quantify the privacy satisfied by a social network against active attacks. To this end, we make use of the graph theoretical concept of $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for which the case $k=1$ represents those graphs achieving the worst scenario in privacy whilst considering the $(k,\ell)$-anonymity measure.
  As a product of our investigation, we present a large number of computational results stating that social networks might not be as insecure as one often thinks. In particular, we develop a large number of experiments on random graphs which show that the number of $1$-metric antidimensional graphs is indeed ridiculously small with respect to the total number of graphs that can be considered. Moreover, we search on several real networks in order to check if they are $1$-metric antidimensional, and obtain that none of them are such. Along the way, we show some theoretical studies on the mathematical properties of the $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for any suitable $k\ge 1$. In addition, we also describe some operations on graphs that are $1$-metric antidimensional so that they get embedded into another larger graphs that are not such, in order to obscure their privacy properties against active attacks.</description>

      <title>MobileCity: An Efficient Framework for Large-Scale Urban Behavior Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices in modern cities, and require prohibitive computational resources for large-scale population simulation. To address these limitations, we first present a virtual city that features multiple functional buildings and transportation modes. Then, we conduct extensive surveys to model behavioral choices and mobility preferences among population groups. Building on these insights, we introduce a simulation framework that captures the complexity of urban mobility while remaining scalable, enabling the simulation of over 4,000 agents. To assess the realism of the generated behaviors, we perform a series of micro and macro-level analyses. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as predicting crowd density from movement patterns and identifying trends in vehicle preferences across agent demographics.</description>

      <title>SCRAG: Social Computing-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation for Community Response Forecasting in Social Media Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing. Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and (ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights into community responses are crucial.</description>

      <title>Network Sampling: An Overview and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.</description>

      <title>Graph Percolation as Decision Threshold for Risk Management in Cross-Country Thermal Soaring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long range flight by fixed-wing aircraft without propulsion systems can be accomplished by "soaring" -- exploiting randomly located updrafts to gain altitude which is expended in gliding flight. As the location of updrafts is uncertain and cannot be determined except through in situ observation, aircraft exploiting this energy source are at risk of failing to find a subsequent updraft. Determining when an updraft must be exploited to continue flight is essential to managing risk and optimizing speed. Graph percolation offers a theoretical explanation for this risk, and a framework for evaluating it using information available to the operator of a soaring aircraft in flight. The utility of graph percolation as a risk measure is examined by analyzing flight logs from human soaring pilots. This analysis indicates that in sport soaring pilots rarely operate in a condition which does not satisfy graph percolation, identifies an apparent desired minimum node degree, and shows that pilots accept reduced climb rates in order to maintain percolation.</description>

      <title>Social sustainability through engagement in a training context with tools such as the Native Podcast and Facebook social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social dimension of sustainability seems to have been a notion rarely addressed in the literature (Dubois et al., 2001) until the early 2000s. The EUTIC 2023 symposium provides an opportunity to take up this topical issue. To this end, we are presenting an engagement process that is part of a sustainable development dynamic, based on digital tools inspired by everyday life, for applications in the context of training, with a view to lifelong learning. Our work, which stems from the information and communication sciences, is rooted in a multi-disciplinary approach that we believe can be echoed in a variety of disciplines, but which it is interesting to challenge, hence the purpose of this contribution.</description>

      <title>GeoRDF2Vec Learning Location-Aware Entity Representations in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many knowledge graphs contain a substantial number of spatial entities, such as cities, buildings, and natural landmarks. For many of these entities, exact geometries are stored within the knowledge graphs. However, most existing approaches for learning entity representations do not take these geometries into account. In this paper, we introduce a variant of RDF2Vec that incorporates geometric information to learn location-aware embeddings of entities. Our approach expands different nodes by flooding the graph from geographic nodes, ensuring that each reachable node is considered. Based on the resulting flooded graph, we apply a modified version of RDF2Vec that biases graph walks using spatial weights. Through evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms both non-location-aware RDF2Vec and GeoTransE.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Dynamic Time Warping for Pandemic Surveillance: Understanding the Relationship between Google Trends Network Metrics and COVID-19 Incidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The premise of network statistics derived from Google Trends data to foresee COVID-19 disease progression is gaining momentum in infodemiology. This approach was applied in Metro Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines. Through dynamic time warping (DTW), the temporal alignment was quantified between network metrics and COVID-19 case trajectories, and systematically explored 320 parameter configurations including two network metrics (network density and clustering coefficient), two data preprocessing methods (Rescaling Daily Data and MSV), multiple thresholds, two correlation window sizes, and Sakoe-Chiba band constraints. Results from the Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that five of the six parameters significantly influenced alignment quality, with the disease comparison type (active cases vs. confirmed cases) demonstrating the strongest effect. The optimal configuration, which is using the network density statistic with a Rescaling Daily Data transformation, a threshold of 0.8, a 15-day window, and a 50-day radius constraint, achieved a DTW score of 36.30. This indicated substantial temporal alignment with the COVID-19 confirmed cases data. The discoveries demonstrate that network metrics rooted from online search behavior can serve as complementary indicators for epidemic surveillance in urban locations like Metro Manila. This strategy leverages the Philippines' extensive online usage during the pandemic to provide potentially valuable early signals of disease spread, and offers a supplementary tool for public health monitoring in resource-limited situations.</description>

      <title>Online posting effects: Unveiling the non-linear journeys of users in depression communities on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become pivotal as self-help forums, enabling individuals to share personal experiences and seek support. However, on topics as sensitive as depression, what are the consequences of online self-disclosure? Here, we delve into the dynamics of mental health discourse on various Reddit boards focused on depression. To this aim, we introduce a data-informed framework reconstructing online dynamics from 303k users interacting over two years. Through user-generated content, we identify 4 distinct clusters representing different psychological states. Our analysis unveils online posting effects: a user can transition to another psychological state after online exposure to peers' emotional/semantic content. As described by conditional Markov chains and different levels of social exposure, users' transitions reveal navigation through both positive and negative phases in a spiral rather than a linear progression. Interpreted in light of psychological literature, related particularly to the Patient Health Engagement (PHE) model, our findings can provide evidence that the type and layout of online social interactions have an impact on users' "journeys" when posting about depression.</description>

      <title>Exposing Cross-Platform Coordinated Inauthentic Activity in the Run-Up to the 2024 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22716v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinated information operations remain a persistent challenge on social media, despite platform efforts to curb them. While previous research has primarily focused on identifying these operations within individual platforms, this study shows that coordination frequently transcends platform boundaries. Leveraging newly collected data of online conversations related to the 2024 U.S. Election across $\mathbb{X}$ (formerly, Twitter), Facebook, and Telegram, we construct similarity networks to detect coordinated communities exhibiting suspicious sharing behaviors within and across platforms. Proposing an advanced coordination detection model, we reveal evidence of potential foreign interference, with Russian-affiliated media being systematically promoted across Telegram and $\mathbb{X}$. Our analysis also uncovers substantial intra- and cross-platform coordinated inauthentic activity, driving the spread of highly partisan, low-credibility, and conspiratorial content. These findings highlight the urgent need for regulatory measures that extend beyond individual platforms to effectively address the growing challenge of cross-platform coordinated influence campaigns.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Study of Climate Microtargeting on Social Media Ads with LLMs: Thematic Insights and Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</description>

      <title>Evaluating DAO Sustainability and Longevity Through On-Chain Governance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) automate governance and resource allocation through smart contracts, aiming to shift decision-making to distributed token holders. However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges linked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical design constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research gaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness, decentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a custom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and analysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance patterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration, which may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable, data-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying potential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional approach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for researchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and effectiveness of DAO-based governance models.</description>
