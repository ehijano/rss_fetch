      <title>Tracking the rotation of light magnetic particles in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-laden turbulence involves complex interactions between the dispersed and continuous phases. Given that particles can exhibit a wide range of properties, such as varying density, size, and shape, their interplay with the flow can lead to various modifications of the turbulence. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of particles is a necessary first step toward revealing the behavior of the multiphase system. Within the context of particle dynamics, accurately resolving rotational motion presents a significantly greater challenge compared to translational motion. We propose an experimental method to track the rotational motion of spherical, light, and magnetic particles with sizes significantly smaller than the Taylor microscale, typically an order of magnitude larger than the Kolmogorov scale of the turbulence in which they are suspended. The method fully resolves all three components of the particle angular velocity using only 2D images acquired from a single camera. This technique enables a detailed investigation of the rotational dynamics of magnetic particles subjected simultaneously to small-scale turbulent structures and external magnetic forcing. Beyond advancing the study of particle dynamics in turbulence, this approach opens new possibilities for actively modulating turbulence through externally applied magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A GENERIC-guided active learning SPH method for viscoelastic fluids using Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When applying machine learning methods to learn viscoelastic constitutive relations, the polymer history dependence in viscoelastic fluids and the generalization ability of machine learning models are challenging. In this paper, guided by the general equation for nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling (GENERIC) framework, a novel GENERIC-guided active learning smoothed particle hydrodynamics (${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$) method is proposed to obtain effective constitutive relations for reliable simulations of viscoelastic flows. By utilizing the GENERIC framework, the target viscoelastic constitutive relation is reduced to a simple functional relation between the eigenvalues of the conformation tensor and the eigenvalues of its thermodynamically conjugated tensorial variable, which incorporates the flow-history-dependent memory effect. Based on data and Gaussian process regression (GPR), a new active learning strategy is developed to obtain the simplified constitutive relation, in which the generalization ability is ensured by actively acquiring more data points when needed. Moreover, a novel relative uncertainty is devised to establish an accuracy evaluation tool for the GPR prediction results, which reduces the number of required training data points while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, the SPH method combined with the latest techniques serves as an effective macroscopic numerical method. Eventually, the Poiseuille flows and the flows around a periodic array of cylinders at different Weissenberg numbers are simulated to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the ${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method. The Oldroyd-B model is used as the ground truth constitutive relation to provide data for GPR, bringing analytical solutions for comparison. The excellent performance demonstrates that the ${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method has promising applications in data-driven simulations of viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>A features-embedded-learning immersed boundary model for large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows with complex boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) and immersed boundary (IB) method offers significant flexibility for simulating high Reynolds number flows involving complex boundaries. However, the approximate boundary conditions (e.g., the wall shear stress boundary condition) developed for body-fitted grids in the literature are not directly applicable to IB methods. In this work, we propose a features-embedded-learning-IB (FEL-IB) wall model to approximate IB boundaries in the hybrid WMLES-IB method, in which the velocity at the IB node (a grid node located in the fluid that has at least one neighbor in the solid) is reconstructed using the power law of the wall, and the momentum flux at the interface between the IB nodes and the fluid nodes is approximated using a neural network model. The neural network model for momentum flux is first pretrained using high-fidelity simulation data of the flow over periodic hills and the logarithmic law, and then learned in the WMLES environment using the ensemble Kalman method. The proposed model is evaluated using two challenging cases: the flow over a body of revolution and the DARPA Suboff submarine model. For the first case, good agreement with the reference data is obtained for the vertical profiles of the streamwise velocity. For the flow over the DARPA Suboff submarine model, WMLES cases with two Reynolds numbers and two grid resolutions are carried out. Overall good a posteriori performance is observed for predicting the mean and root mean square of velocity profiles at various streamwise locations, as well as the skin-friction and pressure coefficients.</description>

      <title>Scale-resolved turbulent Prandtl number for Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at $\boldsymbol{Pr =10^{-3}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to calculate the scale-resolved turbulent Prandtl number $Pr_t$ for the well-mixed and highly inertial bulk of a turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard mesoscale convection layer at a molecular Prandtl number $Pr=10^{-3}$. It builds on Kolmogorov's refined similarity hypothesis of homogeneous isotropic fluid and passive scalar turbulence, based on log-normally distributed amplitudes of kinetic energy and scalar dissipation rates that are coarse-grained over variable scales $r$ in the inertial subrange. Our definition of turbulent (or eddy) viscosity and diffusivity does not rely on mean gradient-based Boussinesq closures of Reynolds stresses and convective heat fluxes. Such gradients are practically absent or indefinite in the bulk. The present study is based on direct numerical simulation of plane-layer convection at an aspect ratio of $\Gamma=25$ for Rayleigh numbers $10^5\leq Ra \leq 10^7$. We find that the turbulent Prandtl number is effectively up to 4 orders of magnitude larger than the molecular one, $\Pr_t\sim 10$. This holds particularly for the upper end of the inertial subrange, where the eddy diffusivity exceeds the molecular value, $\kappa_e(r)&gt;\kappa$. Highly inertial low-Prandtl-number convection behaves effectively as a high-Prandtl number flow, which also supports previous models for the prominent application case of solar convection.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Species Enskog-Vlasov Solver to Determine Evaporation Coefficients of Fluids in High Pressure Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-species Enskog-Vlasov solver. It is used to determine evaporation coefficients of fluids under high-pressure conditions, a critical factor for efficient fuel mixing in internal combustion engines. The solver handles collisions for different fluid species separately, thereby accurately capturing species-specific interactions essential for realistic evaporation modeling. A new pair correlation function based on the BMCSL equation of state is employed to enhance modeling accuracy, though compliance with Onsager relations remains to be explored.
  Validation through various numerical simulations demonstrates the solver's capability. Results from binary fluid relaxation simulations closely match molecular dynamics (MD) data, highlighting accurate collision frequency modeling. Comparative studies against state-of-the-art models verify the solver's precision in predicting liquid-vapor equilibria and evaporation coefficients across diverse pressure scenarios.
  Detailed simulations of argon-neon mixtures with realistic particle diameters and masses underscore the significant improvements achieved by employing this multi-species approach over traditional single-species methods. Comparisons with the SAFT-VRQ Mie and classical density functional theory confirm the solver's reliability in predicting liquid and vapor compositions and detailed density profiles at interfaces over a wide range of pressures and temperatures.
  Further analyses illustrate complex dependencies of evaporation and condensation coefficients on temperature and pressure, consistent with existing research findings. Overall, this work advances computational modeling of multi-species evaporation processes in high-pressure environments at different temperatures, providing essential data for improved combustion modeling and broader applications in multi-phase fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order homogenised riblet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of riblets and other drag-reducing devices has long used the concept of longitudinal and transverse protrusion heights, both as a means to predict the drag reduction itself and as equivalent boundary conditions to simplify numerical simulations by transferring the effect of riblets onto a flat virtual boundary. The limitation of this idea is that it stems from a first-order approximation in the riblet-size parameter $s^+$, and as a consequence it cannot predict other than a linear dependence of drag reduction upon $s^+$; in other words, the initial slope of the drag-reduction curve. Here the concept is extended to a full asymptotic expansion using matched asymptotics, which consistently provides higher-order protrusion heights and higher-order equivalent boundary conditions on a virtual flat surface. This procedure also allows us to explore nonlinearities of the Navier-Stokes equations and the way they enter the $s^+$-expansion, with somewhat surprising results.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Bridging the Divide Between Conservative and Non-Conservative Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of computational fluid dynamics, traditional numerical methods, which heavily rely on discretization, typically necessitate the formulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) in conservative form to accurately capture shocks and other discontinuities in compressible flows. Conversely, utilizing non-conservative forms often introduces significant errors near these discontinuities or results in smeared shocks. This dependency poses a considerable limitation, particularly as many PDEs encountered in complex physical phenomena, such as multi-phase flows, are inherently non-conservative. This inherent non-conservativity restricts the direct applicability of standard numerical solvers designed for conservative forms. This work aims to thoroughly investigate the sensitivity of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the choice of PDE formulation (conservative vs. non-conservative) when solving problems involving shocks and discontinuities. We have conducted this investigation across a range of benchmark problems, specifically the Burgers equation and both steady and unsteady Euler equations, to provide a comprehensive understanding of PINNs capabilities in this critical area.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Origin of Friction Between Suspended Rough Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.</description>

      <title>On-demand microfluidic droplet pinching and splitting under local confinement gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the pinching of an elongated liquid droplet that is confined in a rectangular microchannel. The droplet pinching is induced by a local variation of the channel topography and can lead to its break-up. The modification of the channel topography is either induced by a reversible local dilation of the channel bottom wall or by a confinement gradient that is irreversibly modelled in the channel. Interestingly, in both cases, a few micrometres contraction of the channel height leads to the pinching of the droplet in the direction of the channel width. If this pinching is such that the droplet is no longer confined at the level of its deformation, {\it i.e.} the liquid thread becomes 3D, the droplet splits in two. By minimizing the surface energy of the droplet under the channel confinement gradient, we are able to predict its pinching or its break-up, if any. The dynamic of the droplet deformation is then captured by a semi-analytical model, assuming that most of the viscous dissipation is located in the gutters at the four corners of the channel. Conversely, we show that this kinetic model can be used to extract the average topographic variation of the channel, down to few micrometers, by measuring the droplet pinching dynamics under a classical optical microscope.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Diffusion and Decay of an Expanding Turbulent Blob</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence, left unforced, decays and invades the surrounding quiescent fluid. Though ubiquitous, this simple phenomenon has proven hard to capture within a simple and general framework. Experiments in conventional turbulent flow chambers are inevitably complicated by proximity to boundaries and mean flow, obscuring the fundamental aspects of the relaxation to the quiescent fluid state. Here, we circumvent these issues by creating a spatially-localized blob of turbulent fluid using eight converging vortex generators focused towards the center of a tank of water, and observe its decay and spread over decades in time, using particle image velocimetry with a logarithmic sampling rate. The blob initially expands and decays until it reaches the walls of the tank and eventually transitions to a second regime of approximately spatially uniform decay. We interpret these dynamics within the framework of a nonlinear diffusion equation, which predicts that the ideal quiescent-turbulent fluid boundary is sharp and propagates non-diffusively, driven by turbulent eddies while decaying with characteristic scaling laws. We find direct evidence for this model within the expansion phase of our turbulent blob and use it to account for the detailed behavior we observe, in contrast to earlier studies. Our work provides a detailed spatially-resolved narrative for the behavior of turbulence once the forcing is removed, and demonstrates unexpectedly that the turbulent cascade leaves an indelible footprint far into the decay process.</description>
